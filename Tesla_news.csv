Despite Elon Musk’s dramatic stock selloff that briefly put a dent in Tesla’s share price in the final weeks of 2021, the company proved to investors that its core business remained solid. On Sunday, the electric carmaker reported record quarterly and full-year earnings that easily beat Wall Street expectations.
Tesla delivered 308,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter and 936,000 vehicles in 2021, which almost doubled the total shipment of 2020. Analysts had expected the company to deliver around 270,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter and 897,000 vehicles for the full year.
Tesla shares jumped more than 9 percent Monday morning on the news, pushing the company’s market cap to $1.17 trillion.
The vast majority (90 percent) of Tesla’s 2021 deliveries were Model 3 and Model Y. The company reports combined delivery numbers for its higher-priced vehicles (Model S and X) and lower-priced Model 3 and Y vehicles. It doesn’t break out sales or production numbers by region.
“Great work by Tesla team worldwide!” Musk tweeted Sunday.
“This was a ‘trophy case’ quarter for Musk & Co. with massive momentum moving into 2022,” Wedbush’s Daniel Ives, a top Tesla analyst, tweeted Sunday.
Tesla just announced its 4Q delivery number which beat even the bull case whisper number on the Street. This was a “trophy case” quarter for Musk & Co. with massive momentum moving into 2022. 309k deliveries vs. the Street's 266k and bull case whisper numbers in the 275k range.

Since turning a profit for the first time in the third quarter of 2019, Tesla has managed to double shipments every year—despite a global chip shortage that has slowed down manufacturing for other automakers for the better part of the past two years. Still, Musk has set a lofty goal for Tesla to ramp up production to 20 million electric vehicles a year by 2030. That’s 20 times what it made last year. “Let’s make the roaring 20’s happen!” the CEO tweeted Sunday.
To achieve that, Tesla plans to start production of the Model Y crossover at a new “gigafactory” in Austin, Texas this year and open another factory in Brandenburg, Germany near Berlin.
For the near term, Wall Street is optimistic that Tesla can double sales again in 2022. “Can Tesla do [two million] units in 2022? At this point we’d still describe 2mm as a stretch target but one that looks far more realistic following 4Q deliveries,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a note on Monday. “We believe that fully ramped, the addition of Berlin and Austin will take the Tesla global installed capacity to closer to 3 million units.”
Jonas cautioned that continued global supply chain challenges may dampen this outlook. Also, as more startups and legacy auto brands enter the EV market, Tesla is expected to lose some of its market share in the years to come. In the high-end sector, Tesla faces competition from already hyped models such as Lucid Air and Porsche Taycan, as well as luxury EVs by Mercedes and Audi. In the mass market, the Model 3 and Model Y will be challenged by offerings from Volkswagen, GM and Ford, not to mention a crop of well funded Chinese EV startups that are increasingly eating away Tesla’s market share in China, its largest overseas market."
2,8-Jan-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla's New Austin Factory to Start Up Soon. It's Going to Be Wild.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2617801203/BFD812D457A14912PQ/726?accountid=13946,"Christmas arrived a little late for Tesla bulls. They have been eagerly awaiting the start-up of new manufacturing capacity. Now the start-up is imminent.
Saturday, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote that Tesla's (ticker: TSLA) new facility in Austin, Texas, known as Gigafactory Texas, will begin production in about a week. That means more Model Y crossover vehicles—and, just as important, that the Cybertruck will be arriving on U.S. roads shortly.
""Based on our analysis of Giga Austin it appears paperwork is now clearing the way for Model Y production starting over the next 7 to 10 days,"" wrote Ives. ""Launching the Austin production in early January is very important to Tesla expanding both domestic and global production of Model Y's which are set to have a massive year in 2022.""
Tesla delivered more than 936,000 vehicles in 2021. The vast majority— more than 911,000 —were Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossover vehicles. Tesla doesn't provide a more detailed breakdown. The Model 3 and Y are Tesla's lower-priced, higher-volume Models. The Model Y is the hottest seller right now and CEO Elon Musk has high hopes for the vehicle.
""We think the Model Y will be the best-selling vehicle of any kind globally,"" said Elon Musk, referring to 2023, at the company's annual meeting —held in Austin back in October. ""We need Austin to get online and Berlin to get online and reach volume production, and then I think that's going to happen.""
Wall Street expects Tesla to deliver 1.4 million units in 2022, up 55% compared with 2021. Tesla has given volume guidance, but it is really more like a goal. The company says it wants to grow volume at 50% a year for the foreseeable future. Volumes rose 87% in 2021 compared with 2020. The pace at which production ramps up at Austin will go a long way to determining if Tesla can hit its 50% growth goal this year.
Tesla's other new plant, in Berlin, Germany, is also about to start up production. That plant will produce Model Y crossover vehicles to start, like Texas.
It should be a wild year for Tesla, which is essentially doubling production capacity, going from two plants to four. Tesla also makes cars in Fremont, Calif., and Shanghai, China.
The two new plants means a lot will change. Profit margins will change as European volumes are delivered from Europe instead of from China. In addition to the Model Y, the Austin plant will make the light-duty pickup truck called Cybertruck . That will compete with Ford Motor's (F) all-electric F-150 Lightning in an important vehicle segment in the U.S., where pickup trucks account for 20% of all new vehicle sales. And, of course, investors will watch closely to see if Tesla can sell all its cars as it produces more and as other auto makers, such as Ford with its electric truck, bring more EV models to the market.
Tesla stock rose 50% in 2021 as it delivered more cars than expected. It will probably take another delivery ""beat,"" better than 1.4 million, to keep the stock working higher in 2022.
Tesla stock opened the year up 13% Monday, Jan. 3, after better-than-expected delivery numbers were released on Jan. 2. Then shares sold off amid a broader tech rout. Investors were spooked by the Federal Reserve's December meeting minutes, which indicated it was committed to raising interest rates. Higher interest rates especially hurt highly valued growth stocks, as the future profits investors are betting on will be worth less.
Tesla stock is now down 2.8% year to date. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite are down 1.9%, 0.3%, and 4.5%, respectively.

3,13-Jan-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk, Hollywood Actors Criticize California's Plan to Cut Solar Subsidies; State's public utilities commission says proposal balances power grid, environment and consumers' needs; critics say it hampers environmental progress",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2619288868/BFD812D457A14912PQ/751?accountid=13946,"A proposal to cut incentives for rooftop solar power in California has drawn criticism from some environmentalists, Hollywood stars and business leaders, including Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk.
The proposal by the California Public Utilities Commission would add monthly fees for solar customers while also reducing payments to customers for any extra power they generate and supply to the grid, which is known as net metering.
Critics say the plan threatens to derail environmental progress in the state.
The CPUC, in its proposal, said the current energy-metering structure isn't cost-effective and hurts customers who don't participate in the solar program as well as low-income ratepayers. The rule changes ""ensures all customers pay for their usage of the grid,"" the proposal says.
More than one million California customers have solar systems installed, according to the CPUC.
Since rooftop solar customers pay less in utility bills, they end up contributing less toward maintaining the grid, which they still use. The cost burden is thus often shifted to power customers without rooftop solar, according to the proposal. Various groups peg that cost shift at between $1 billion and $3.4 billion a year. 
The proposed change to the net metering rules ""balances the needs of the electric grid, the environment, and consumers,"" a CPUC spokeswoman said Thursday. CPUC said a proposed decision may be heard, at the earliest, at its Jan. 27 voting meeting.
If the proposal passes, it would take new residential solar customers about 11 years to make back their upfront investment in solar panels through reduced electricity bills, a jump from the roughly six to seven years it currently takes, according to BloombergNEF estimates.
Mr. Musk on Twitter called the proposal a ""bizarre anti-environment move."" Tesla launched a webpage that calls on Gov. Gavin Newsom and the CPUC to reject ""the proposed solar tax,"" and instructs visitors on how to submit feedback to the relevant public bodies and officials.
Mr. Musk's Tesla has a financial incentive to oppose the CPUC proposal. Tesla invests in solar energy with its green energy subsidiary, Tesla Energy. It sells solar panels and battery systems that store solar energy. Tesla purchased solar-energy company SolarCity Corp. in 2016.
Tesla representatives didn't respond Thursday to a request for comment.
Some environmental groups and Hollywood celebrities have voiced concerns, saying the rooftop solar market is key to the state meeting its climate goals. Actor Edward Norton said the proposal comes while California is ""burning & drying out due to climate change.""
The CPUC proposal says the net-energy metering program ""has and should continue to assist the State in meeting its energy and climate goals.""
""However, because the Commission is mandated to create a tariff that adheres to the entire statute—including equity concerns—the growth of the market should not come at the undue and burdensome financial expense of nonparticipant Ratepayers,"" it said.
Mr. Newsom said at a press conference earlier this week that ""we still have some work to do,"" regarding the proposal.
A spokesman for the Democratic governor said that the CPUC is an independent commission, which will ultimately decide on the matter.
""In the meantime, Governor Newsom continues to move forward with his commitment to California's clean energy goals, which includes the ability for Californians to access a diverse range of renewable energy sources,"" the spokesman said.

4,14-Jan-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk-Backed EV Battery Technology Rises to Dominance in China; Tesla, Chinese makers take lead over rivals in using less-expensive iron in place of nickel",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2619533084/BFD812D457A14912PQ/730?accountid=13946,"A less-expensive battery technology championed by Tesla Inc.'s Elon Musk rose to dominate the world's largest auto market last year, pointing to challenges for Tesla's U.S. and European rivals.
Official Chinese figures showed that batteries using lithium iron phosphate or LFP technology accounted for 57% of total battery production for vehicles in China during 2021, up from less than half the previous year.
The LFP batteries have stormed into the lead in China because they use relatively inexpensive iron in the battery's cathode in place of costlier metals such as nickel.
Their rise has coincided with the emergence of electric vehicles as a mass-market product in China. In 2021, new-energy vehicles, a category that mostly consists of EVs, accounted for nearly one in six passenger cars sold in China , the world's top auto market by number of vehicles sold.
As Chinese car dealers sell more EVs and a greater proportion of those EVs carry LFP batteries, production of the iron batteries is surging. In 2021, Chinese battery makers produced LFP batteries with 125.4 gigawatt-hours of capacity, more than triple the figure from a year earlier, said the government-backed China Automotive Battery Research Institute.
U.S. and European car companies traditionally frowned on LFP batteries because they tend to have lower energy density than nickel-based batteries, meaning the cars they power can't travel as far on a single charge. LFP batteries also are more likely to suffer from poor performance in cold weather.
Over the last two decades, Chinese companies trying to catch up with Japan and the U.S. in battery technology focused on improving LFP technology, not only because of the cost but also because the batteries are less likely to catch fire. A change in Chinese government EV subsidies, which previously favored longer-range cars, also helped the technology gain an edge.
One of the strongest advocates is Tesla's Mr. Musk, who has said that finding enough nickel at reasonable cost is a major production concern. He has pushed back against the idea that customers buying an LFP car are getting a second-class product.
""Our intent with this pack is that product experience is roughly equivalent between nickel & iron,"" Mr. Musk wrote on Twitter last August to a customer who was offered earlier delivery of a Tesla if he chose the LFP option.
""I'd personally slightly opt for iron pack, as it wants to be charged to 100% whereas nickel prefers ~90%,"" Mr. Musk said in the Twitter post.
Car makers in the U.S., Europe and Japan are all stepping up battery production and many are working on LFP technology, but they generally haven't gotten as far as Tesla and Chinese makers in bringing the technology into mass-market production.
Tesla first used LFP batteries for its China-made Model 3 in 2020. Last October, the company said it would extend the use of the iron-based batteries to all of its standard-range cars. China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., the world's biggest maker of electric-vehicle batteries, supplies Tesla with LFP batteries.
Other Chinese electric vehicle brands are also becoming heavy users of LFP cathodes. The Hong Guang Mini, a tiny hatchback costing as little as $4,400, was China's bestselling EV in 2021. It is made by a joint venture of General Motors Co. and two other Chinese companies.
Warren Buffett-backed BYD Co. Ltd., a Chinese company that makes both electric vehicles and the batteries that go into them, has designed an LFP battery in a blade shape. It says its design has higher energy density to give EVs longer range.
""Almost all the car brands you can think of are in talks with us about cooperation based on blade battery technologies,"" BYD's Vice President He Long said last year when announcing the battery, according to the company's social-media account.

5,17-Jan-22,Republican & Herald,Smart progressives should love Elon Musk,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2620854722/BFD812D457A14912PQ/758?accountid=13946,"Nearly everything Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted about Elon Musk was wrong. Scratch the word “nearly.” Everything was wrong.
Last month, the senator from Massachusetts tweeted, “Let’s change the rigged tax code so the Person of the Year will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everyone else.”
Some background: The founder of Tesla had just been anointed the richest human on earth, and Time Magazine named him Person of the Year. Three months before, SpaceX, which he also founded, sent the first all-civilian crew into space.
Musk tweeted back to Warren, “And if you opened your eyes for 2 seconds, you would realize I will pay more taxes than any American in history this year.” He’s put the number at something north of $11 billion, which, if true, would be more taxes than any other American paid ever.
Whether Musk’s tax bill should have been higher can be subject for debate. We can agree that $11 billion is a healthy tax bill, but it’s not an unseemly sum for one enjoying a net worth of around $243 billion.
Warren’s implication that Musk doesn’t pay taxes at all, however, is ignorant. The charge that he’s “freeloading” — if you look at how he made that money — is awe-inspiring dumb. Musk has done more than any person on earth to replace cars run by the internal combustion engine, a significant factor in the climate crisis, with clean electric vehicles.
In 2020, when General Motors and Ford were closing factories because they couldn’t find enough specialized computer chips, Tesla took the chips that were around and rewrote software to make them work in its cars. So while Ford, GM and Stellantis (Fiat Chrysler merged with Peugeot) sold fewer cars in 2021 than the year before, Tesla sold 87% more.
Six years ago, when the major U.S. carmakers were wondering whether or not to go big on electric, Tesla was building a huge battery factory in Nevada. The others are now in the game major league, and Tesla can be credited with pushing them.
But in the marathon race to win the electric vehicle market, Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said, “Tesla is in the lead at mile number 21. Everybody else is at mile 2 or still tying their shoes.”
So Musk is full of himself. He has reasons.
What bothers some 20th-century progressives is that Musk is an unapologetic capitalist who mocks them for obsessing on his wealth.
Leading the pack is Sen. Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator’s brain has long been stalled on the subject of billionaires whom he once said shouldn’t exist. When he tweeted, “We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share. Period,” Musk trolled him: “I keep forgetting that you’re still alive.”
Musk may not be volunteering to pay more taxes than he has to, but we who think the superrich should pay more must understand that the solution is not them, but the tax laws. The tax code is the creation of Congress.
Back to Warren. “As we face the existential threat of our time — climate change,” she wrote as a presidential candidate, “Wall Street is refusing to listen, let alone take real action.”
Wrong again. Actually, Wall Street has been moving away from investments in fossil fuels — to the point that Texas passed a law banning companies that refuse to finance oil ventures from state contracts.
It is Wall Street that rewarded Musk for accelerating the changeover to electric vehicles. (Tesla also has a thriving solar panel business.) If helping save the planet let Musk edge out Amazon’s Jeff Bezos as the world’s richest person, well, where’s the problem?

Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system is (again) stirring up a storm of controversy on the internet. The EV maker on Monday released the newest (version 10.9) updates of its FSD Beta to a select group of Tesla owners. The day before, a software safety advocacy organization called “The Dawn Project” placed a full-page advertisement in Sunday’s New York Times, calling Tesla FSD “the worst software ever sold by a Fortune 500 company” and urging the public to not be “crash test dummies for thousands of Tesla cars” with FSD.
The ad was paid for by The Dawn Project’s founder Dan O’Dowd, who is also the CEO of Green Hills Software, a company that provides operating systems to automakers, as well as the aerospace industry.
Subscribe to Observer’s Business Newsletter
After reviewing “many hours” of YouTube videos of drivers testing FSD, O’Dowd arrived at the conclusions that the system commits a “critical driving error,” as defined by the California DMV Driving Performance Evaluation, every eight minutes and that, if the system was used in every passenger vehicle in the U.S., “millions would die every day.”
To prove his point, O’Dowd is offering a $10,000 reward “to the first person who can name another commercial product from a Fortune 500 company that has a critical malfunction every 8 minutes.”
Today I placed a full-page advertisement in the @nytimes, campaigning to ban @Tesla full self-driving from our roads. @RealDawnProject is organizing the opposition to @ElonMusk’s ill-advised full self-driving robot car experiment #FSDDelendaEst #DawnProject
— Dan O'Dowd (@RealDanODowd) January 16, 2022
Under O’Dowd’s share of his NYT ad on Twitter, a Tesla investor named Dave Lee suggested in a comment that Green Hills had taken money from Tesla competitors, to which Elon Musk responded, “Green Hills software is a pile of trash.”
Green Hills software is a pile of trash. Linux ftw.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 16, 2022
According to Green Hills website, the company most recently worked with BMW on its iX electric sports utility vehicle.
O’Dowd argued that nobody knows a product’s flaws better than its competitors. “They tear them apart, they figure out what they do right, they figure out what they do wrong,” he told Fox Business Monday. “They know better, and they’ll tell you. The salesman is never going to tell you those things.”
Tesla has been testing Full Self-Driving Beta for over a year with a small group of Tesla owners who have high “safety scores.” A less advanced driver assistance system called Autopilot is available on all Tesla vehicles.
O’Dowd said the original version of Autopilot was built using Green Hills Software but he later backed away from the project because he didn’t believe it was going to work. Tesla hasn’t confirmed this information.
The latest FSD Beta allows a Tesla vehicle to drive itself to a destination entered in its navigation system. But the driver is required to stay alert and be ready to take control at any time.
FSD is the most expensive driver assistance system in the EV market right now. And it’s getting even pricier with each new iteration. Last week, Tesla announced that the price was scheduled to jump from $10,000 to $12,000 on January 17 with the 10.9 release and that additional increases can be expected as the technology improves.
Musk has recently claimed that there hasn’t been any accident or injury caused by FSD since its launch. But the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is in the process of investigating whether FSD was involved in a Model Y crash that occurred in Brea, California, on November 3."

The study illuminated a global inequity between the rich and lower classes. Official data from the report, published Monday, noted that the 10 richest men, which includes kingpins Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, increased in sum total their salaries from $700 billion to $1.5 trillion from March 2020 to November 2021. The study was not peer-reviewed.  Meanwhile, those who fell below the top percentile of income – 99% of people worldwide – saw a decrease in income over that same timespan, the report indicates based on data compiled from the World Bank. Even worse, the report detailed that more than 160 million people have been forced to poverty.  The secret IRS files: Trove of never-before-seen records reveal how wealthiest avoid income tax Viral tweet: Elon Musk says he'll pay more than $11 billion in taxes this year ""Billionaires have had a terrific pandemic,"" Oxfam International Executive Director Gabriela Bucher said in a statement Monday. ""Central banks pumped trillions of dollars into financial markets to save the economy, yet much of that has ended up lining the pockets of billionaires riding a stock market boom.""  Bucher noted from the Oxfam report that the great divide has ""deadly"" consequences because many lower-income households are unable to pay for health care. Oxfam is pushing for a tax on the rich as a way to begin ""righting the violent wrongs of this obscene inequality."" Oxfam calculated the wealth gains for its methodology of the 10 richest men based on Forbes' real-time data on billionaires. According to Forbes, Tesla executive Musk is the richest man in the world through 2021 with $268 billion, while Amazon executive Bezos came in second at $188 billion. Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Warren Buffett were also on the list.  Much of the Oxfam study follows the trend of the U.S. stock market, which has sharply vaulted since March 2020 because of monetary policies enacted by the Federal Reserve. That has created an opening to massive, untaxed wealth gains for the rich, while those who don't have market shares are left with no room to gain.

8,24-Jan-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Tesla Countersues JPMorgan in Fight Over Warrants; Auto maker alleges the bank's dislike of Elon Musk is behind its $162 million lawsuit in November,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2622273420/BFD812D457A14912PQ/713?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc. countersued JPMorgan Chase & Co. on Monday, intensifying a dispute over the payout for a bond sale the bank helped arrange in 2014.
JPMorgan started the fight with a lawsuit in November, claiming it was owed around $162 million more for a set of warrants it had acquired as part of the bond sale. Tesla on Monday said the bank wasn't entitled to the billions of dollars in stock it got last year from those warrants.
The dispute is lifting the curtain on a testy relationship between the nation's biggest bank and the world's most valuable auto maker. JPMorgan has been spurned by Tesla on business dealings and executives at the companies have clashed , including chief executives Jamie Dimon and Elon Musk, The Wall Street Journal has reported.
Tesla claimed that the feud is what is really behind JPMorgan's suit. It alleged the bank's actions amounted to ""bad faith and avarice.""
""JPM pressed its exorbitant demand as an act of retaliation against Tesla both for it having passed over JPM in major business deals and out of senior JPM executives' animus toward Mr. Musk,"" Tesla alleged.
Mr. Musk said he would write a one-star review on Yelp if the bank didn't withdraw the suit.
JPMorgan said Monday that ""there is no merit to their claim. This comes down to fulfilling contractual obligations.""
The dispute centers on one of Mr. Musk's more turbulent episodes, when he toyed with taking Tesla private in 2018. He was later forced to relinquish his title as chairman in a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over his tweets about it.
In 2014, JPMorgan acquired warrants from Tesla as part of a convertible bond sale it worked on for the auto maker with other banks. The warrants allowed the banks to acquire stock in Tesla at a set price when they expired in June and July 2021.
JPMorgan has claimed Mr. Musk affected the value of the warrants when he tweeted in 2018 he had the funding to take Tesla private. The bank used his tweets as justification to lower the strike price of the warrants, allowing it to get more profit if Tesla's stock kept rising.
Last summer, Tesla paid up based on the original price but refused to accept JPMorgan's change. The bank got what amounted to billions of dollars in stock, Tesla said Monday.
Tesla on Monday said JPMorgan had no right to make the change and demand more money, in part because it said the bank didn't really believe Mr. Musk would take Tesla private. It said Mr. Musk's tweets didn't impact the value and that none of the other banks made the change.
Tesla said the bank broke the contract and instead should have canceled the warrants and returned them. The suit is seeking unspecified damages and fees from the bank.

Dogecoin's value shot up about 6.5% as of Tuesday afternoon, starting at $0.127 when the market opened and reaching a high of $0.141, according to the Nasdaq. Musk has been a longtime champion of the cryptocurrency, tweeting, ""Dogecoin is the people's crypto,"" last February. Dogecoin started as a spoof coin featuring the face of a Shiba Inu and has steadily risen in value, reaching over ten cents in April of 2021. Dogecoin was inspired by the popular Doge meme of a Shiba Inu staring sideways at the camera with raised eyebrows, according to the website Know Your Meme. Dogecoin's value goes up: The price of Dogecoin, created to poke fun at cryptocurrency, is above 10 cents When asked why he supports Dogecoin, Musk responded on Twitter: ""Lots of people I talked to on the production lines at Tesla or building rockets at SpaceX own Doge. They aren’t financial experts or Silicon Valley technologists. That’s why I decided to support Doge – it felt like the people’s crypto."" While McDonald's did not respond to the tweet, competitors like Burger King and Jack-in-the-Box touted their brands in the comments section. Musk himself owns Dogecoin, along with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to a tweet he posted in October 2021. Despite his tweets on cryptocurrency, Musk encouraged building value over investing heavily in cryptocurrencies, saying in an October 2021 tweet, ""True value is building products & providing services to your fellow human beings, not money in any form.""

Cybertruck was first introduced to the public in November 2019 and originally scheduled to go on sale in 2021. Production has been postponed multiple times due to design changes and ordering of manufacturing equipment, among other reasons. Tesla now aims to begin delivery in late 2022 and possibly early 2023.
Over the weekend, the Tesla fan forum “Cybertruck Owners’ Club” posted online leaked photos of what appeared to be the latest Cybertruck prototype taken inside a Tesla factory. The photos show several changes from the original Cybertruck design debuted in 2019, most notably the addition of side view mirrors, a giant, single-arm windshield wiper that parks vertically along the roof pillar, and the absence of any door handles. (Musk has said doors will open automatically as you approach the vehicle.)
Despite its unusual look, Cybertruck is designed to be a mass-market, full-sized electric pickup truck. Since accepting pre-orders in November 2019, Tesla has reportedly sold between one million and three million Cybertruck reservations, according to third-party trackers. (Tesla doesn’t disclose exact numbers.) Tesla currently manufactures less than one million vehicles across its Gigafactories in California and China. Production capacity is expected to ramp up rapidly with the addition of two new factories in Berlin, Germany and Austin, Texas.
Earlier this month, Tesla reported that it delivered 308,600 electric vehicles globally—the vast majority being Model 3 and Model Y—in the fourth quarter of 2021, another record. Its full-year delivery was just shy of one million, at 936,172, representing almost 100 percent growth from 2020."
11,26-Jan-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk Says Tesla Will Give Priority to Deliveries Over New Vehicles in 2022; Electric-vehicle maker plans to scout and possibly announce new production sites this year,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2622643472/BFD812D457A14912PQ/738?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk said Tesla Inc. won't introduce new vehicles this year, as the electric-vehicle maker bets on increasing deliveries over diversifying its product offerings in the face of ongoing supply-chain disruptions.
Introducing new vehicles now would dent Tesla's ability to grow output, Mr. Musk said Wednesday as the company posted record earnings.
""The fundamental focus of Tesla this year is scaling output,"" Mr. Musk said, noting that he expects the company to comfortably boost output by more than 50% this year.
It has been nearly two years since Tesla last delivered a new model— the Model Y compact sport-utility vehicle —to customers. Meanwhile, auto makers are expected to launch more than two dozen new battery-powered vehicles in the U.S. this year, according to Bank of America.
A rapid increase in vehicle deliveries helped Tesla generate record profit in 2021. Tesla reported a $5.5 billion annual profit on $53.8 billion of sales last year, after increasing vehicle deliveries 87% from 2020. That is up from $721 million in profit and $31.5 billion in sales in 2020, when Tesla generated its first full-year profit , and ahead of Wall Street's expectations.
Mr. Musk's electric-vehicle maker leveraged in-house software engineering expertise to navigate the global computer-chip shortage last year, helping it to increase vehicle deliveries at its fastest pace in years. It also benefited, like many auto makers, from surging car prices as demand outran supply.
Yet it hasn't been immune to supply-chain problems, which, paired with transportation, labor and other challenges, caused Tesla to run factories below capacity, the company said.
The company's automotive gross margin, a measure of its cost efficiency, rose to 29.3% last year, from 25.6% in 2020, even though Tesla said rising raw-materials prices and higher logistics costs dented profit, as did increased costs related to vehicle recalls.
The global shortage of semiconductors that has hit the auto industry hard is expected to persist through the year, though ease somewhat, Mr. Musk said.
The company's shares closed up around 2% Wednesday in regular trading and were fluctuating between losses and gains in post-market trading after Tesla released its results.
Among the new vehicles on Tesla's plate are the ""Cybertruck"" pickup, unveiled in 2019, and the semitrailer truck, which Tesla revealed in 2017. Mr. Musk said the company wasn't currently working on the $25,000 car he had previously teased, aimed at making electric vehicles accessible to a wider array of customers.
Analysts expect Tesla to build on last year's momentum by delivering nearly 1.5 million vehicles to customers in 2022, according to FactSet. That is consistent with the company's target of increasing deliveries by 50% annually, on average, in the coming years. Tesla said that, as of the fourth quarter, it was producing at an annualized rate of more than 1.22 million vehicles.
Key to those growth plans are new factories in Germany and in Texas. The company has faced delays at both facilities , which it had hoped to have operational last year. Analysts now expect Tesla, which said it had started building Model Ys in Texas, to begin delivering vehicles made at the plants in the next few months.
In Germany, the Brandenburg state government says the approval process for Tesla's factory near Berlin is in the final stages after the company, in December, provided the last batch of requested documents.
Tesla has received temporary approval at each step of the construction process and has been producing vehicles in small numbers to test machines at the plant, but it isn't allowed to sell any vehicles made there or shift into mass production, state officials said.
The car maker said it was also looking to expand capacity at its Fremont, Calif., plant.
Mr. Musk said Tesla would scout new factory locations this year and likely be in a position to announce selections toward the end of the year.
Tesla, which has long relied on battery cells from suppliers such as Panasonic Corp., has also been working to produce new, larger cells that it designed in-house.
Meanwhile, the company has been broadening access to an advanced driver-assistance feature designed to help vehicles navigate cities. Tesla said nearly 60,000 vehicles in the U.S. now have access to the city-driving tool, which is part of a package that Tesla has dubbed ""Full Self-Driving,"" though it doesn't make vehicles autonomous. Tesla recently increased the price of that package 20%, to $12,000.

 Elon Musk Says Tesla Will Give Priority to Deliveries Over New Vehicles in 2022

12,27-Jan-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Tesla Is a Proven Automaker, an Unproven Tech Giant; Elon Musk's company has shown it can generate cash selling electric vehicles, but its valuation depends on much more",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2622847064/BFD812D457A14912PQ/725?accountid=13946,"With help from China, Tesla has turned itself into an unusually profitable car maker. Whether that makes it a tech company worthy of a near-trillion-dollar valuation is less clear.
As it has scaled up production in its Shanghai factory over the past two years, the electric-vehicle pioneer has accumulated enough profit to make up for all the losses in its previous history. Late Wednesday it reported a 14.7% operating margin for the fourth quarter in an industry where single-digit margins are considered normal.
That margin was a record for Tesla, but it wasn't quite as high as analysts had hoped. The company's strong fourth-quarter sales may have lifted hopes that it could easily beat the 14.6% number reported for the third quarter. Instead, the scale benefits were eaten up by rising commodity and transportation costs as well as $340 million in payroll expenses related to Elon Musk's stock awards. The stock didn't move much in after-hours trading.
The expense of batteries makes EVs less profitable than traditional cars for other auto makers. Among the explanations for Tesla's surprising profitability might be a direct sales model—unlike other car makers, it doesn't hand any margin to dealers—and the sheer scale of the two factories it now has up and running. Both its Fremont, Calif. and Shanghai plants produced roughly 470,000 vehicles last year, making them among the largest in the world.
This lesson will be important to remember as Tesla scales up factories in Austin, Texas and Berlin this year and next. The company itself has said the process of ""ramping"" production in its two new plants will weigh on margins. This may be particularly true compared with its experience in China: Beijing appeared to have rolled out a red carpet for Tesla. China also has a cheaper battery supply chain than Europe or North America.
The major risk to Tesla's execution in the coming years is pressures in the supply chain, not just for semiconductors but also batteries. It might continue to outshine traditional auto makers in the marketplace consumers see, but it also needs to compete with them for raw materials. As just about every traditional car maker starts to scale up EV output, that will become increasingly challenging. Prices for battery metals such as nickel and lithium are flashing warning signals .
The other risk concerns valuation : Tesla trades for almost 12 times forward revenues, which is hardly like an industrial stock. It stands to reason that even the exemplary execution of an industrial growth strategy won't be enough.
On a call to discuss the results Wednesday, Chief Executive Elon Musk repeatedly stressed the importance of self-driving software to Tesla's long-term prospects. ""Everything pales in comparison to the value of robotaxis,"" he said.
But any competitive edge Tesla might have here is much less clear than its leadership in electric vehicles and the battery technology that drives them. Driverless cars have consistently proven harder to deliver than Mr. Musk has anticipated and, by relying mainly on cameras as sensors, he is taking a riskier approach to the problem than the rest of the industry.
Although Tesla is turning out very impressive results for a car maker, its stock price depends on its becoming something else. For all the achievements of the past year, Mr. Musk still has much to prove.

13,27-Jan-22,Barron's (Online),The Fed's 'Nimble' Approach Signals a Wild Ride Ahead,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2622927677/BFD812D457A14912PQ/753?accountid=13946,"Keep calm and be nimble—an oxymoron for the ages.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday the central bank would be nimble when it comes to monetary policy and the path of interest-rate increases this year. The markets did anything but keep calm.
Market participants were hoping for some certainty, a pathway perhaps, something to suppress the sort of volatility that has been a daily occurrence of late.
The Fed did clearly suggest interest rates will start to rise in March , which has long been expected, but that was pretty much it in terms of specifics.
The markets didn't react much to the statement, but then Powell took to the mic.
Along with promising to be nimble, Powell didn't rule out the possibility of rate increases at every meeting this year, as opposed to every other meeting.
""We'll need to be nimble so that we can respond to the full range of plausible outcomes,"" Powell said, adding that the Fed will be ""guided by the data.""
It's safe to say investors didn't like it . The yield on the two-year treasury note, more sensitive to Fed policy, rose from around 1.07% to 1.199% following the press conference. Stocks quickly reversed course as substantial daily gains were swiftly erased.
The Fed's data-driven off the cuff approach means future inflation readings will become box office events.

Netflix Gets Some Attention From Bill Ackman's Pershing Square
Netflix stock is down nearly 50% from its November peak, but it got a jolt late Wednesday after hedge fund manager Bill Ackman announced his Pershing Square Capital Management has bought 3.1 million shares since last Friday, making it a top-20 holder.
* Ackman said in a letter to Pershing investors that last week's selloff in the stock, after the company reported disappointing subscriber numbers and short-term guidance, created an ""opportunity to acquire Netflix at an attractive valuation.""
* Pershing's stake-building coincides with a period of extreme market swings. To pay for the position, Pershing unwound a majority of its interest-rate hedge, for proceeds of $1.25 billion, the letter said. Representatives of Pershing and Netflix had no comment. Netflix shares rose 5% after-hours.
* Ackman said he began analyzing Netflix in connection with the firm's investment in Universal Music Group. With both stakes ""we are all-in on streaming as we love the business models, the industry contexts, and the management teams.""
* Pershing bought 7.1% of Universal Music from Vivendi in August with the possibility to buy another 2.9% in September. UMG is the world's biggest music company.
What's Next: Netflix expects to add a smaller number of subscribers this quarter, facing an increasingly crowded streaming field that includes competition from Apple, Walt Disney, and other companies.

Tesla's Elon Musk Says Company Not Making New Models
Tesla won't be releasing new models this year and isn't working on a $25,000 car right now, according to CEO Elon Musk, who blamed the continuing chip shortage. It will focus on driverless vehicle tech development and increasing production at existing factories.
* The electric-vehicle maker will at some point return to working on the cheaper model, he said . ""We have enough on our plate right now. Too much on our plate, frankly.""
* The company reported earnings of $2.54 a share in the fourth quarter from $17.7 billion in sales. Operating profit came in at $2.6 billion and free cash flow at $2.8 billion. Wall Street expected earnings per share of $2.36 from revenue of $17.1 billion.
* Trying to introduce new vehicles this year would interfere with trying to raise output, which Musk sees increasing by 50%. Tesla hasn't delivered a new model in two years.
* Tesla has been working on the ""Cybertruck"" pickup, revealed in 2019, and a semitrailer truck, revealed in 2017. The $25,000 car was meant to make electric vehicles available to a broader set of potential buyers.
What's Next: Analysts expect Tesla to deliver nearly 1.5 million vehicles this year. As of the fourth quarter, it was making an annualized rate of more than 1.22 million vehicles.

Samsung, Lam Research Warn of Supply-Chain Challenges
Samsung Electronics said Thursday it would aim for a larger share of the smartphone market in 2022, and announced a 53% increase in operating profit to the highest level in four years during the last three months of 2021.
* The Korea-based company warned that supply-chain problems remained a challenge notably for nonmemory chips, with high demand expected for devices such as 5G smartphones and high-performance computers.
* Operating profit in the final quarter of 2021 amounted to 13.9 trillion won ($11.6 billion). Net profit rose 64% to 10.8 trillion won. The chips division's profit more than doubled from the same quarter of 2020 to 8.84 trillion won.
* Sales of memory chips came in below analysts' expectations, with Samsung executives indicating the company had decided not to push sales aggressively. Samsung shares declined by 2.7% Thursday in Seoul, compared with a 3.5% fall for the broader Korean KOSPI index.
* Supply-chain challenges also hit results for U.S. chip equipment supplier Lam Research, which was down 4.7% in premarket trading Thursday after the company posted fiscal second-quarter revenue below analysts' expectations and forecast third-quarter revenue that trailed Wall Street estimates.
What's Next: It will take time before the massive investments recently decided by the world's largest chip makers finally help ease the current bottlenecks. Meanwhile, expect the ""challenges"" to last for another few months.

Free N95 Masks Showing Up at Pharmacies, Stores
Retailers have started receiving the 400 million free N95 masks to give out to people as part of a plan by President Joe Biden. Masks will be available in coming weeks from participants in the federal pharmacy vaccine program, including Albertsons, Costco, CVS, Kroger, Publix, Rite Aid, Walgreens, and Walmart.
* Adults can get three free masks per visit a day; with no identification or insurance card required and no sales tax. U.S.-made N95 masks from the federal government's Strategic National Stockpile are designed to filter out up to 95% of particles in the air.
* The Department of Health and Human Services is providing the masks as part of the Biden administration's overall strategy—along with vaccines, boosters, Covid-19 tests, pills, and antibody treatments—to fight the pandemic and keep schools and businesses open.
* Mask availability has been constrained by supply-chain challenges, and increased demand for better masks led to price-gouging and counterfeit masks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a guide to help people distinguish between real and fake government-approved masks.
* CVS earlier in January raised its full-year earnings guidance, citing higher demand for Covid-19 vaccines and tests, both in-store lab tests and at-home rapid tests. Walgreens has also raised its fiscal-year guidance to reflect ""continued positive momentum.""
What's Next: By mid-February, masks will be available at ""tens of thousands of convenient sites,"" including community health centers, pharmacies, and stores, White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeffrey Zients said.

Abbott Labs Expects $2.5 Billion in Covid Test Sales
Abbott Laboratories, maker of the BinaxNOW rapid antigen test, reported fourth-quarter earnings and sales that beat Wall Street estimates, and expects $2.5 billion in Covid-19 test sales in fiscal 2022. The Defense Department signed a $306 million contract for Abbott to supply tests for the government's mail-order program.
* Although the average number of new coronavirus infections has declined 6% from last week, to 692,400, the average number of daily deaths is up 21% to nearly 2,200. ""'Milder' does not mean 'mild,'"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday.
* New hospitalizations declined 8% from last week, to 19,800, but the Omicron coronavirus variant is still straining local hospitals. About 211 million Americans are fully vaccinated, and 85 million have received booster shots, including 70% of eligible seniors and half of eligible adults, the CDC said.
* As of Wednesday, the U.S. has shipped 400 million free vaccine doses to 112 countries, toward the Biden administration's goal of donating 1.2 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses worldwide, said Zients.
What's Next: There are ongoing studies for Covid-19 vaccines for children six to 24 months, and ages 2 to 4, but it isn't clear when data might be presented to the Food and Drug Administration or what the FDA or CDC might say about the vaccines, Zients said.

 The Fed's 'Nimble' Approach Signals a Wild Ride Ahead 
"
14,28-Jan-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk's Decision to Slow New Tesla Models Risks Holding Up Growth; CEO says company doesn't plan to introduce any new vehicle models in 2022,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2623297993/BFD812D457A14912PQ/727?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk is betting that he can turn Tesla Inc. into one of the world's largest car makers while selling just a handful of models, challenging a long-held auto-industry belief that it takes a diverse stable of updated models to attract buyers.
It is another example of Mr. Musk's defiance of industry orthodoxy—at a time when electric-vehicle competition has never been fiercer.
Tesla, which is aiming to increase vehicle deliveries by an average of 50% a year, doesn't plan to bring any new models to market in 2022, Mr. Musk said this week. The company has punted production of its long-awaited Cybertruck pickup to 2023, he said, and isn't working on the $25,000 car he previously teased.
Such delays are likely to make it difficult for Tesla to maintain its rapid pace of growth, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said, questioning whether demand for the Model 3 and Model Y would be sufficient by 2024 for the company to meet its growth targets.
If Tesla were to increase vehicle deliveries by its 50%-a-year target, it likely would need to deliver more than three million vehicles in 2024. Its Model 3 sedan and Model Y compact sport-utility vehicle made up 97% of Tesla's roughly 936,000 deliveries last year.
""There's really no precedent for a single-model car to sell 1.5 million units per year, let alone two of them from the same company,"" Mr. Sacconaghi said.
Toyota Motor Corp.'s Corolla was the most popular vehicle in the world in 2020, with sales of more than 1.1 million vehicles, according to a Bernstein analysis.
Mr. Musk dismissed such concerns, telling analysts that Tesla's advanced driver-assistance technology would make its vehicles more useful and, therefore, valuable.
""It's apparent from the questions that the gravity of Full Self-Driving is not fully appreciated,"" he said. ""If the cost of our cars did not change at all, we would still sell as many as we could possibly make."" Full Self-Driving is a suite of advanced driver-assistance features that Tesla sells for $12,000. It doesn't yet make vehicles autonomous.
Tesla's production delays were met with skepticism on Wall Street, where the stock plunged more than 11% on Thursday, the day after Tesla reported a record annual profit of $5.5 billion for 2021. The stock recovered some of that decline Friday, rising 2.1%.
Tesla's focus on ramping up production of existing models is likely to help the company pad its bottom line this year, but delaying the release of new models could eventually leave it more vulnerable to competition, analysts said. Car companies typically aim for 10% to 15% of their models in any given year to have recently undergone a significant update, Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said.
Mr. Musk has kept buyers waiting for new models before. The company's Model X sport-utility vehicle , for example, was initially slated for production in late 2013. Roughly two years later, Tesla had delivered only a handful of the SUVs.
This time around, buyers have a bevy of alternative electric vehicles to choose from. General Motors Co. has said it is aiming to introduce 30 new electric vehicles globally by 2025. This year alone, auto makers are expected to launch more than two dozen battery-powered vehicles in the U.S., according to Bank of America. Among them is an electric version of Ford Motor Co.'s F-150 pickup truck . Rivian Automotive Inc., which went public in November, was the first to market in the lucrative pickup truck segment, launching its R1T last year .
""Every day Tesla waits, there's going to be a new entry,"" said Tyson Jominy, who leads research firm J.D. Power's data and analytics practice.
Ford's experience roughly a century ago could offer a warning to Tesla, said Mr. Johnson, the Barclays analyst, in a recent note to investors. Ford controlled roughly 60% of the U.S. auto market in 1921 thanks to the success of the Model T, he wrote. Ford focused on the Model T in the years to come, but as it did so, rivals including General Motors released a wider range of cars that whittled away at Ford's market share, which by 1927 had fallen to 16%.
""With little additional detail around future physical product, we see risk of Tesla repeating the Ford Model T history of the 1920s,"" Mr. Johnson wrote.
Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Musk has made his mark by steering an independent course in the car industry, defying doubters. He invested in all-electric vehicles when many industry stalwarts questioned their viability, eventually transforming Tesla into the world's most valuable car maker and himself into the world's richest person.
Tesla's ability to meet its production targets with its existing lineup of vehicles is likely to depend heavily on the company's success in China , the world's largest auto market, said Mark Wakefield, a managing director at consulting firm AlixPartners LLP.
Tesla's Shanghai plant became the company's largest by output last year, but Tesla is facing a more difficult business environment in China, where it has been caught up in the government's crackdown on big tech.
Mr. Musk, in Tesla's analyst call, focused on the promise of the company's efforts to develop fully autonomous vehicles.
""Over time, we think Full Self-Driving will become the most important source of profitability for Tesla,"" Mr. Musk said, adding on Thursday that it would likely take rivals at least five years to emulate Tesla's technology .

 Elon Musk's Decision to Slow New Tesla Models Risks Holding Up Growth 
Credit: By Rebecca Elliott "
15,10-Feb-22,Los Angeles Times,PERSPECTIVES; A nascent Silicon Valley 2.0 in Texas; Loss of Tesla and other companies to Austin could threaten California's economic future,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2627036317/BFD812D457A14912PQ/742?accountid=13946,"When Tesla announced last fall that it was moving its corporate headquarters from California to Texas, officials in Sacramento seemed more surprised than concerned.
After all, Tesla was expanding its sprawling Fremont, Calif., assembly plant, which already employs thousands of people. It's building a battery factory in the Northern California town of Lathrop.
And real estate brokers say the company is leasing more office space in Palo Alto, where its corporate headquarters had been since 2009. Tesla was founded in nearby San Carlos in 2003.

Yet the decision by the electric vehicle pioneer's chief executive, Elon Musk, to move Tesla's headquarters to the Texas capital of Austin may signal gathering clouds on the horizon of California's economic future.
For the present, things are still looking bright for the state. Sacramento has been enjoying unprecedented growth in revenue, thanks in large part to high capital gains taxes paid by the super-rich in Silicon Valley.
And in a measure of California's present hold on the tech sector, the Golden State remains far and away the leader in raising venture capital.
For years, California has suffered a net out-migration of people to Texas. But the losses in population tended to be at the lower end of the socioeconomic scale and the state has grown steadily richer despite the large outflows of people.
What worries some economists and other analysts is that this favorable pattern may be starting to change.
Tesla was one of an accelerating number of California companies, including other big tech names such as Oracle and HP Enterprise, that have relocated headquarters to Texas.
""I believe this is just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Dan Ives, who has been covering the tech sector for more than two decades, and is currently managing director at Los Angeles-based Wedbush Securities. He said 20% of the companies he follows are considering relocating or opening a second headquarters outside California.
Stanford's Hoover Institution tallied 74 such company moves out of the state in the first half of last year, more than all of 2020 and higher than the comparable period in each of the prior two years. Researchers cited a litany of factors for the change: the rising cost of living in California, a tax structure and labor policies that many corporate leaders see as unfriendly, and concerns that the quality of life is declining.
In the case of Tesla, which last month also started producing vehicles near Austin, the decidedly conservative views of its multibillionaire boss may have made Texas an appealing base. Musk personally moved there in 2020.
The state's net population loss to Texas, the top destination for migrants, last year was about double the pace of the last decade, according to credit data analyzed by Moody's Analytics. Some kept their California jobs, thanks to new remote work opportunities. Others started businesses in Texas.
To be sure, the Bay Area has such a deep reservoir of tech talent, money and infrastructure, not to mention the climate and the ocean, that it won't be easily knocked off its perch.
First-generation tech firms Apple, Cisco, Intel, Hewlett-Packard, among others, are still in the Bay Area, as are newer tech icons Facebook, Google and Netflix.
And Stanford and Berkeley are key generators of talent, research and new ideas for Silicon Valley's ecosystem.
But California's tech hub today seems to be facing what beset Hollywood years earlier, when Canada and states such as Georgia, where Marvel does much of its shooting nowadays, lured away film production from Los Angeles with numerous incentives.
""The Silicon Valley has lost its monopoly on opportunity, and now it has to compete,"" said Patrick McKenna, founder of One America Works, which connects talent with new tech communities. ""It has to compete with other locations to attract the talent that's going to build the future.""
McKenna spent 15 years in the Bay Area as an entrepreneur and investor, but in 2019 moved to Austin. He saw opportunities in central Texas but also rued the fact that many people in the Bay Area were being left behind in the tech boom.
Of the state's record budget surpluses, McKenna said: ""California is flush right now because it's harvesting an investment that happened 10 years ago.""
Increasingly he sees other states and nations cutting into California's share of the technology industry.
Economic officials at Gov. Gavin Newsom's office say it's natural that as companies such as Tesla grow to become world leaders, they will expand elsewhere to be closer to markets and supply chains and to extend their global footprint.
Businesses will continue to leave California just as they have for decades, these officials argue, but there are good reasons why firms were born and incubated in the state, and why more will come and start ventures and take companies public, creating more wealth and more jobs.
""The idea that the California economy is imperiled is not borne out by the numbers,"" said Dee Dee Myers, a former White House press secretary for President Clinton. She is now Newsom's director of business and economic development.
It's true that in tech, no city or state comes close to the Bay Area in the amount of new venture capital -- $120 billion last year, a figure that until 2018 was more than the total for the rest of the country, said Kyle Stanford, a senior analyst at PitchBook, a Seattle financial data and software firm that tracks private capital markets.
In terms of number of venture capital deals, despite growth elsewhere, the Bay Area's share held firm last year -- topping 20% as it has every year since at least 2006. That's important because companies tend to start or set up fairly close to where the lead investor is based, which buys the Bay Area some time.
But, Stanford says, ""there's definitely a risk of losing major emerging companies when you have these large tech giants move out. You're going to see engineers from Tesla probably create new companies in Austin, and those are companies that are going be lost in the Bay Area.""
Moreover, while in the popular imagination Texas remains a vast landscape of cowboys, oil and conservative politics, the reality is more complex: The state's universities have built up stronger reputations in engineering and other specialties prized by corporations.
And Austin, whose unofficial motto is ""Keep Austin weird,"" demonstrates that at least some parts of the state are becoming culturally compatible with Californians.
Nor can Silicon Valley count on people coming from overseas to make up the loss.
Foreign-born students, researchers and entrepreneurs have been a big part of California's tech boom, but the unwelcoming immigration policies under former President Trump, plus lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Cold War-like relations with China, have had chilling effects.
Then there's California's high cost of living, particularly housing.
In the Bay Area, the typical home now fetches a median price of $1.2 million, which is more than double the cost in Austin, despite the rapid rise in home values there. The cost of housing in Dallas is one-fourth the price in the Bay Area.
Brett Arnold, 35, an accountant and lifelong California resident, and his wife, Jamie, moved to a town about an hour north of Dallas in July, primarily because of the difference in the cost of living.
The couple had both worked in Orange County to keep up financially, but she wanted to stay at home with their 4-year-old. So in April, the Arnolds sold their Rancho Santa Margarita town home for $730,000 and bought a much larger, 2,800-square-foot house in Prosper, Texas, for $570,000.
""The quality of life has gone up,"" Brett Arnold said.
For now at least, Austin's share of the nation's venture capital, tech startups and revenues pales next to the Bay Area. But it is rising, thanks in good part to Silicon Valley.
Meta, formerly Facebook, is leasing 33 floors in what will soon be the city's tallest building. Oracle is estimated to have 2,500 employees at its campus near Lady Bird Lake, and local reports say it's buying nine more acres nearby, enough to house well over 10,000 workers.
Amid the pandemic in 2020, as Oracle announced its headquarters move, the company said it would take ""a modern approach to work that gives our employees more flexibility to choose where and how to work.""
No one knows how many from Tesla have moved with Musk, although some, including Valerie Workman, head of human resources and one of its highest-ranking Black employees, have since left the company.
Musk, in his characteristically flamboyant style, said its Texas operations could scale up to 20,000 employees. Its Austin-area factory has the potential to produce three times as many vehicles as the Fremont facility, said Ives of Wedbush.
Over the next 18 to 24 months, Ives said, Tesla is likely to move the research and development and design operations in Palo Alto to Austin.
""They could find engineers 50% cheaper in Austin than in the Silicon Valley,"" he said. And such a move would bring the company's brain trust close to where Musk lives.
Plus, that's what many employees may prefer, to settle in semi-remote places where they can enjoy a higher standard of living. It's partly why Tesla's Irvine-based rival, Rivian, is producing its vehicles in northern Illinois and outside Atlanta, analysts say.
Intel is building its new chip factory near Columbus, Ohio. Other tech firms are going to Nashville.
""California and the valley always will have an allure geographically that can't be matched,"" Ives said, ""but now you're starting to see alternatives.""
Joel Kotkin, a fellow at Chapman University and longtime analyst of demographic, social and economic trends in California, worries especially about the state's heavy dependence for tax dollars from tech initial public offerings and the super-wealthy to pay for progressive but expensive policies -- such as for the environment and the social safety net.
In 2019, the top 1% of taxpayers in California paid about 45% of personal income taxes, which make up about two-thirds of the state's entire general fund revenues.
In a report with colleague Marshall Toplansky, Kotkin wrote that the losses of company headquarters have eroded the state's economic diversity and opportunities for upward mobility for the middle class.
""In the aggregate we could look good because Apple computer by itself makes you look good,"" Kotkin said in an interview. ""If we continue this gusher of tech money, we could just continue to subsidize the vast majority of the population and maybe won't collapse,"" he said.
But what happens if that cornucopia of tax money begins to shrink?
""We could either restore California's promise as a land where people go and their lives are improved,"" he said, ""or we could become some sort of high-tech feudal state, which is where we're headed.""

16,15-Feb-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla's Elon Musk Gave Away $5.7 Billion. But to Whom? We Have a Guess.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2628530675/BFD812D457A14912PQ/731?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk gave away more than 5 million Tesla shares worth more than $5.7 billion at the end of 2021. It's a large philanthropic gift for the CEO. The question is who got them? Barron's has a guess.
The gift was reported Monday evening in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and leaves little clues to who was the recipient.
Tesla and Musk didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about who got the stock.
But the amount is close to the $6 billion figure mentioned in late October into early November regarding ending world hunger. Back then, World Food Programme Executive Director David Beasley said in an interview that 2% of Elon Musk's wealth, or about $6 billion, could solve the hunger problem.
Musk responded with a challenge: Explain how that can happen and he would donate the stock.
The World Food Programme took up that challenge and explained in mid-November how $6.6 billion could avert catastrophic famine for 42 million people.
About $3.5 billion would be used to deliver food to the most vulnerable. Another $2 billion would go to cash and voucher programs so needy families could spend money on food locally. The remaining $1.1 billion would be for ""country specific costs"" and program administration.
Whether the explanation worked or not is anyone's guess. The World Food Programme didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
A gift of that size to the World Food Programme would help quell one criticism Musk has received. Musk, along with running Tesla, runs SpaceX . His space company is developing technology to send people and cargo to the moon and even Mars. Musk, along with other billionaires, have sometimes been criticized for spending money on a new commercial space race in lieu of direction money to more terrestrial problems.
Musk has always responded that spending a little money on space, to make life multiplanetary, is a good idea and doesn't preclude spending money on other things.
Musk just might be living out that observation now. He is rich enough to do both.
Tesla stock was up 2.9% in premarket trading Tuesday. The gift probably isn't the reason. Stock market futures were higher. S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 1.4% and 1.1%, respectively.

17,17-Feb-22,Washington Examiner,Musk accuses SEC of harassing Tesla to chill his criticism of government,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2629880058/BFD812D457A14912PQ/740?accountid=13946,"A lawyer for Elon Musk blasted the Securities and Exchange Commission and accused the agency of using its power to harass the Tesla founder.
In a letter to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, described a “pattern of conduct” by the SEC that “has gone beyond the pale.” He said that the regulator, which is led by Chairman Gary Gensler, has failed to distribute the $40 million to shareholders it collected as part of a settlement over a 2018 tweet from Musk.
“Instead, it has been devoting its formidable resources to endless, unfounded investigations into Mr. Musk and Tesla,” Spiro wrote.
Musk’s controversial tweet said that he was considering taking Tesla private after its share price reached $420, adding, “funding secured.” The SEC sued Musk in response, although they reached a settlement soon after.
‘SOMETHING HAS GOT TO GIVE’: ELON MUSK CALLS RECORD-HIGH NATIONAL DEBT UNSUSTAINABLE
Spiro also accused the SEC of using its power to investigate Musk and Tesla for his vocal criticism of the government. Musk has repeatedly panned the Biden administration’s proposals and has criticized the government more generally.
“The SEC seems to be targeting Mr. Musk and Tesla for unrelenting investigation largely because Mr. Musk remains an outspoken critic of the government; the SEC’s outsized efforts seem calculated to chill his exercise of First Amendment rights rather than to enforce generally applicable laws in evenhanded fashion,” the letter reads.
Musk, who is the world’s wealthiest person, has not shied away from using his public position, and Twitter platform, to express his political views. Last month he tweeted that President Joe Biden is “treating the American public like fools.”
He also recently tweeted: “If you scare people enough, they will demand removal of freedom. This is the path to tyranny.”
“Canadian truckers rule,” Musk tweeted that same day, referring to the protests against pandemic restrictions and vaccination mandates in Canada. “Freedom is being stripped away one piece at a time until it is gone.”
While Biden was trying to enact his now-dead Build Back Better tax and spending plan, Musk blasted the “trickery” of the bill, channeling pre-eminent free-market economist Milton Friedman.
“Nothing is more permanent than a ‘temporary’ government program,” the billionaire said, which is an almost exact word-for-word quote from Friedman, who is known as a major proponent of free-market capitalism and one of the leaders of the Chicago School of economics.
During a December interview with the Wall Street Journal, Musk said he is not an “extreme libertarian” but does think that the U.S. should reduce the role of the government. Musk also bucked the notion of federal subsidies, even for the electric vehicles that his company is known for.
“It does not make sense to take the job of capital allocation away from people who have demonstrated great skill at capital allocation and give it to an entity that has demonstrated very poor skill in capital allocation, which is the government,” Musk said.
“The government is simply the biggest corporation, with a monopoly on violence, and where you have no recourse,” he added, using a phrase attributed to renowned sociologist Max Weber.
Spiro’s Thursday letter concluded by urging the court to intervene on behalf of Musk and Tesla investors.
“Enough is enough. Mr. Musk and Tesla write in the hope that the Court can bring the SEC’s harassment campaign to an end, while ensuring that the SEC finally delivers, at long last, on its commitment to Tesla’s shareholders and this Court,” Spiro wrote.
Thursday’s letter to the judge comes as Tesla has issued four recalls this year for its vehicles. The recalls were for various problems, including a faulty seat belt chime and rolling stops at intersections. Earlier this month, Tesla recalled over 800,000 vehicles over an electrical problem that causes the audible seat belt chime to not always activate.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has also launched an investigation into more than 400,000 Tesla vehicles over complaints about phantom braking.
While Tesla’s stock skyrocketed during the pandemic, it is down more than 13% over the past month.

18,19-Feb-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk's Accusation of Harassment Countered by SEC; Regulator files letter with court saying its engagement with Tesla and its CEO is in line with 2018 settlement,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2630407966/BFD812D457A14912PQ/723?accountid=13946,"WASHINGTON—The Securities and Exchange Commission pushed back Friday on Tesla Inc.'s allegation that regulators are harassing Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk over his compliance with a 2018 regulatory settlement.
That deal focused on claims that Mr. Musk misled investors with a tweet in 2018 about taking the electric-vehicle maker private. The judgment required Tesla to preclear some of Mr. Musk's public statements, including tweets deemed material to shareholders.
Tesla said in a regulatory filing last week that the SEC had subpoenaed the company in November about compliance with the settlement. That subpoena relates to how Tesla oversaw Mr. Musk's statements, but was issued as part of a newer investigation, not as a continuation of the earlier litigation, a person familiar with the matter said.
A Tesla lawyer on Thursday accused the SEC of harassing Mr. Musk with ""serial investigations"" of him or the company. ""Enough is enough,"" lawyer Alex Spiro wrote. ""Mr. Musk and Tesla write in the hope that the court can bring the SEC's harassment campaign to an end.""
In a letter filed Friday to a Manhattan federal judge, the SEC said its engagement with Tesla and Mr. Musk about how they comply with the policy is consistent with the expectations of the court overseeing the settlement.
""The commission's enforcement staff have…sought to meet and confer with counsel for Tesla and Mr. Musk to address any concerns regarding Tesla and Mr. Musk's compliance,"" Steven Buchholz, a senior SEC official in San Francisco, wrote in the letter.
Tesla's stock, which closed Friday at $856.98, is down roughly 7% since Feb. 4, before the company disclosed the new SEC subpoena.
Mr. Musk, Tesla and the SEC have been skirmishing since 2018, when he landed in trouble over a tweet that regulators said was misleading. Mr. Musk wrote that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 a share. After an investigation, the SEC said that Mr. Musk had never discussed such a going-private deal and that his statement, which caused Tesla's stock to skyrocket, constituted fraud.
Mr. Musk and Tesla settled the SEC lawsuit by each agreeing to pay $20 million, and Mr. Musk stepped down as chairman. He also agreed to preclear tweets that were deemed material to Tesla shareholders with Tesla's lawyers. A Manhattan federal court approved the policy, which covered a list of events, financial metrics and product announcements.
Within a year of settling with Mr. Musk and Tesla, regulators suspected that Mr. Musk had violated the pact with tweets about Tesla production numbers and the company's stock price. SEC attorneys wrote Tesla in 2019 and 2020 asking why certain tweets weren't cleared by company lawyers. Tesla pushed back, saying the statements weren't covered by the court judgment.
Mr. Musk continued to antagonize the SEC, tweeting in July 2020: ""SEC, three letter acronym, middle word is Elon's.""
Mr. Musk's use of Twitter has remained controversial. Earlier this week he tweeted and later deleted a meme comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler.
Now that the SEC has responded to Mr. Spiro's letter, it isn't clear what comes next. U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan has previously urged the two sides to negotiate their compliance disputes, rather than running back to court and asking her to fault the other side and issue sanctions.
Mr. Spiro also complained this week that the SEC still hasn't distributed the $40 million in fine money to shareholders, which the regulator said it would do when it reached the settlement in late 2018.
Mr. Buchholz said in his response to the court that regulators have been working on a plan to share the money with investors. The method for doing so is complex, but the SEC expects to submit the plan by March, he wrote.

19,20-Feb-22,Detroit Free Press,"Barra taking steps to prove GM stock as valuable as Tesla: With all-EV future and more, she aims to raise revenue",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2630617247/BFD812D457A14912PQ/509?accountid=13946,"""When Barra wakes up and the stock versus Ford or Tesla is languishing, I feel her pain. But I think it's going to work out. It's investor perception.""
Erik Gordon
Business professor at the University of Michigan
General Motors CEO Mary Barra is masterful at masking what must be an annoying question she is regularly asked.
Is GM stock undervalued?
In short, she has said, yes, it is. See Barra has a vision: She has been transforming GM over the past several years to make it a technology company, one that happens to make cars.
She has promised that GM's future cars will all be battery electric by 2035. Barra has also promised to deliver to market soon a self-driving taxi service through subsidiary Cruise.
Last October, she outlined various ways GM will add profits from future software development connected to EVs and self-driving vehicles, ultimately delivering $300 million in revenue by 2030. That's double what GM makes now.
And GM reported pretax profits of a record-breaking $14.3 billion for 2021 compared with $9.7 billion in 2020. That happened despite the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips hampering new-vehicle production across the industry, including GM, for nearly all of last year.
Yet Wall Street seems blasé when it comes to GM's value, especially when compared to some rivals. The open stock market values GM and Ford at about $73 billion, even though Ford has fewer sales and less profit, whereas Tesla, which has even smaller sales and income, is valued at close to $1 trillion by investors.
""I'm sure she is tired of being asked why Tesla's stock is worth so much. I was tired of thinking about that covering Tesla for nearly seven years,"" said David Whiston, auto analyst at Morningstar. ""GM's EV plans are not timid and they dived into being all-electric well before Ford. They just didn't have a really cool battery electric vehicle until the Hummer came out last year.""
Wall Street's values
GM's investment in EVs and self-driving car technology plays a big role in how much investors value the company since market capitalization is based on future innovation.
GM declined to make Barra available for this article, but spokesman David Barnas said Wall Street's valuation of the company will not steer GM off course.
""We're confident in our strategy,"" Barnas said. ""Our clear priority is to accelerate our EV plan and drive growth, which is exactly what we're doing, and we have consistently demonstrated that we're the team that delivers on our commitments.""
Late last year, GM launched the 2022 GMC Hummer EV pickup, built at Factory ZERO in Detroit and Hamtramck. The Hummer SUV EV will start production there next year.
This year, GM will launch the 2023 Cadillac Lyriq all-electric SUV, built in Tennessee, and next year, the 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV will come out. It will be built at Factory ZERO and eventually Orion Assembly in Orion Township, too, where GM presently assembles the Chevrolet Bolt EV and EUVs.
But beating the Silverado to market will be Ford's F-150 Lightning pickup, due out this spring. GM sees the Hummers as early competitors to the Ford Lightning. Ford launched the Mach-E all-electric SUV, styled after the Mustang, in late 2019.
GM sold 6.3 million vehicles globally last year, bringing in $14.3 billion in pretax profits. Its market cap as of Feb. 16 was $72.5 billion, a figure Whiston says is undervalued in light of all GM is doing to transition to an EV future.
Market capitalization, also called market cap, is the value of a publicly traded company and it matters because it signals investors' confidence in a company, based on what it has coming in the future. It can inspire more people to buy the stock, thereby boosting the stock price, which is key if any CEO wants to stay employed.
""A bigger cap can mean more media exposure which can bring more investors to the stock,"" said Whiston. ""It can also make lenders or prospective investors in a secondary stock offering (the offerings that happen after an initial public offering) feel more comfortable because they are investing in a big company.""
The market cap amount is calculated by multiplying the company's total number of shares by the company's current share price. Market cap gives investors an idea of the company's size and worth.
Some investors might see a big company as far less likely to fail than a small one because it can more easily raise funds if needed, Whiston said.
GM's market cap pales in comparison with Tesla, especially when considering Tesla's financials are a fraction of GM's. The EV maker reported a 2021 net income of $5.5 billion and it sold 936,172 vehicles globally, yet Wall Street values it at $941 billion as of Feb. 16.
Ford reported a profit of $10 billion in 2021, selling 3.9 million vehicles. Its market cap matched GM's at $72 billion as of Feb. 16.
Ford and GM market cap values have fluctuated over the years. On March 30, 2020, Ford's market cap sank to a low of $17 billion. GM's, also a low point that day, was $26 billion. Then, on Jan. 10 this year, Ford's market cap shot up to $100.63 billion, topping GM's that day by $12billion.
Whiston has not covered Tesla for Morningstar since June of last year, but he believes a driver behind the market's faith in Tesla is CEO Elon Musk.
""He's an extraordinary person (basically the next Steve Jobs) and the stock gets thought of as a tech company rather than a capital intensive automaker, which gives the stock a premium,"" Whiston wrote the Free Press in an email. ""Tesla is showing growing demand and margins that an internal combustion engine firm can't do as well as impressive tech.""
No matter what the numbers, Whiston says GM remains undervalued. To change that, the automaker must keep beating analysts' consensus earnings estimates and generating strong free cash flow while the company also invests aggressively in EVs, he said.
""Having good free cash flow consistently has been hard due to the (2019) strike, COVID-19 pandemic, and now chip shortage,"" Whiston said.
But he added, ""There's so many cool and transformative things going on at GM and even if they only partly reach their 2030 goal of about $300 billion in revenue and 12%-14% earnings before interest and taxes margin, that's still a lot more earnings than they do now.""
Barra vs. Farley
It may all come down to messaging.
Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan, said a reason for GM's market cap being undervalued is mere messaging — and perhaps the messenger.
Ford CEO Jim Farley aggressively promotes Ford's plans and any hot-new products such as the Bronco SUV, the Mach-E and the Lightning pickup.
""One thing Farley has been very good at is stirring up the excitement,"" Gordon said. ""He's not Elon Musk, but I don't think he wants to be Elon Musk or P.T. Barnum. But he stirs up excitement.""
But Barra has also shown off GM's new EVs. She has taken a spin in a Hummer EV with President Joe Biden at Factory ZERO's grand opening in November and she virtually introduced the Silverado EV reveal last month at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.
But, Gordon said, she has a more serious style that perhaps doesn't grab investor attention.
""Mary Barra is one of the best CEOs GM has ever had, but she is not able to stir up the excitement that Farley has,"" Gordon said. ""She is not a flashy person. She's an impressive person and an excellent speaker. Lots of substance, less flash.""
But GM's marketing boss, Deborah Wahl, has said she does have a plan to promote and ""normalize"" EV adoption to the masses. To further that message, GM ran a 60-second spot during the Super Bowl earlier this month starring Mike Myers to tout the automaker's upcoming EV lineup.
Ford's 'family jewels' help
Barra shows no desire to emulate Tesla's outspoken Musk.
When asked by a reporter in December for her reaction to Musk's comments about Biden's proposed EV credits and other EV incentives, she said, ""I'm not going to get into a match on that type of stuff because I actually mean what I say and say what I mean.""
Besides personalities, there is perception. Gordon said there was a perception that Ford was far behind GM on EV development and then caught up, so the market rewarded it. But Gordon said Ford was never that far behind GM in the first place, it just got better at messaging its EV mission.
Plus, Ford has been committing some of its most prized brands to EVs: Mustang and the F-150, said Steve Melnyk, professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.
""These brands are critical to Ford; they form part of the identity of Ford. They are almost the family jewels,"" Melnyk said. ""The message in committing these brands to e-cars is simple: EV is critical to Ford and its future.""
In contrast, GM has the Chevrolet Bolt, the Cadillac Lyriq and GMC Hummer EVs, names that don't have the same degree of brand identity, Melnyk said.
And sometimes the future doesn't matter as much as the past, Melnyk said.
GM has a long experience with electric cars, but it has also had problems. Most recently, the global recall for the 2017-22 Bolt EVs and EUVs for defective batteries that could pose a fire risk. There were 18 related fires of Bolts, 15 of which GM has confirmed.
""How can you be an EV leader if I have to park my car outside for the concern of a battery fire?"" Gordon said. ""We always get recalls, but the image of a car setting your garage on fire is a really vivid image.""
GM's battery supplier LG Electronics Inc., a division of LG Chem, will reimburse GM $1.9 billion for making the defective batteries. GM remains in the midst of fixing the 140,000 Bolts impacted by the recall; both Gordon and Melnyk say investors could perceive it as a bad sign for the future.
""Given the difference in problems, as an investor, I would have more confidence in Ford moving forward,"" Melnyk said.
'Homegrown treasure'
Yet both GM and Ford have made good investments in the future and they have been learning, Gordon said.
Both automakers, Gordon said, are led by strong leaders.
""Farley and Barra are both good CEOs,"" Gordon said.
But how secure is her job if GM's market cap doesn't rise in light of GM's financials and future plans?
Gordon said her job should not be in jeopardy, ""unless the board has lost its mind. She's a homegrown treasure. GM is all she's done since she was a kid. The fact that the stock is languishing that's on the investors. But you have to be happy with Barra as a CEO.""
Whiston agreed saying, ""As long as the board wants Mary there she does not need to worry and I don't want her to leave just in some lame attempt to boost the stock price.""
'We'll prove it'
Analysts and industry experts are not the only ones who think GM is undervalued.
In December, reporters asked Barra why GM's market cap continues to be dwarfed by startup Rivian, then with a market cap of $95billion, and Tesla.
""Sometimes the iconic traditional company, even though they're innovating quickly, just gets looked at with a different lens and that's OK, we'll prove it,"" Barra said of GM's $87.5 billion value in December.
But Barra admitted that GM needs to do a better job telling why it will lead the transition to EVs. Then deliver new EVs that consumers want to buy.
A month prior, during an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin during the New York Times DealBook Online Summit, Sorkin asked Barra her feelings on the fact that GM has made 10 times the profits as Tesla, yet Tesla's market valuation was $1 trillion then, as GM's hovered at about $84 billion.
Barra said such high market valuations prove GM is ""so undervalued"" by Wall Street. But she insisted it doesn't bother her because GM will be rewarded once it completes its EV plan.
""I see it as huge opportunity for General Motors to capture significant more value,"" Barra said.
Slow and steady wins
Often, stock prices have turbulence as investors either get exuberant or spooked depending on the day's news.
On Feb. 8, for example, Morgan Stanley's lead analyst Adam Jonas cited GM's 2022 earnings guidance as ""well below"" Morgan Stanley's forecast. He had concerns over the pace of the automaker's EV transition, so Jonas downgraded GM's stock.
On that news, the stock opened at its lowest point since September. But the price recovered throughout that day to close down by 2.5% to $49.46 a share, topping GM's 52-week low of $47.07 a share.
Kate Whitefoot, an associate professor of engineering and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, said it is too early in the auto industry's EV transition to determine true market value.
""Wall Street is looking at speed to market, but maybe taking a slower approach is better in the long run,"" Whitefoot said.
The shift to EVs is all consuming for the auto industry from design of vehicles, to working with dealers to ramping up sales of EVs.
""The market is responding in terms of whether it's GM, Ford or Tesla, are they meeting their expectations of the timing of that transition?"" Whitefoot said.
Best batteries win
The winner of this long-term transition will depend on a lot more than just who is first to market with a product, Whitefoot said.
""GM is taking a strategy in their EVs that is different from Ford,"" Whitefoot said. ""Ford is using their existing platforms and converting them to EVs. GM is creating its Ultium platform. That may be an advantage. But we'll wait to see.""
The Ultium platform will underpin all of GM's future EVs. Barra has said it allows GM to offer a wide array of vehicles across various price points, including developing an EV that will start at $25,000 to encourage EV adoption.
GM also has a joint venture with LG Chem called Ultium Cells LLC to make its own battery cells. GM said it will build four new battery plants in the U.S. It has only given the locations of three so far, one of which will be in Lansing.
Ford has also committed to making batteries and is investing in building three new battery plants.
""Tesla entered the market from the opposite direction of a lot of other automakers,"" Whitefoot said. ""They started as an electric vehicle company and now they're doing this combined approach of working with battery suppliers and using their own factories to realize the sort of volume of batteries they need.""
Whitefoot said the top-selling EVs in the future will depend on how the batteries perform. So the companies that design and make the best batteries, win.
""If you want to come in, like a Tesla, you have to know both sides of the business: How to make a great battery and also how to build vehicles. It's not enough to do just one of those sides,"" Whitefoot said. ""Those companies that can build on expertise in both manufacturing and batteries will have a competitive edge.""
Sympathy for Barra
That would appear to be GM and Ford.
Yet just four months ago, in October, Tesla joined an exclusive club when it topped a trillion dollars in market capitalization. It was the fifth U.S. company to do so, along with Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet, the parent company of Google, according to Reuters.
""I have some sympathy for Barra,"" Gordon said. ""When Barra wakes up and the stock versus Ford or Tesla is languishing, I feel her pain. But I think it's going to work out. It's investor perception.""

20,21-Feb-22,Daily Record,"Elon Musk's $5.7B donation sparks questions about giving: Stirs debates about transparency, tax deductions",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2723272209/BFD812D457A14912PQ/762?accountid=13946,"Leave it to Elon Musk to stir up controversy without saying – or tweeting – a word.
In November, according to a regulatory filling, the Tesla CEO donated to charity about 5million shares of company stock, worth $5.7billion. Since the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission was made public Monday, Tesla hasn't responded to a request for comment. Nor has Musk mentioned the donation on Twitter, his favorite communications forum.
Yet that hasn't quelled debates in and out of philanthropy, about transparency, tax deductions and congressional legislation, along with speculation about where exactly the money was donated. Some experts say Musk likely donated his shares to his donor-advised fund, or DAF for short. DAFs are essentially charitable investment accounts in which donors can claim a tax deduction upfront but aren't legally required to distribute the money.
Experts say that would be the most advantageous strategy for Musk, currently the world's richest man with an approximate net worth of more than $220billion. A DAF donation would allow him to claim a tax deduction of as much as 30% of his 2021 adjusted gross income, instead of 20% if he had donated it instead to his foundation. Musk could also deduct the fair market value of the stock, instead of its original value.
""He can do whatever he wants with his money – anyone can,"" said John Arnold, a billionaire philanthropist who co-founded the Laura and John Arnold Foundation and Arnold Ventures with his wife, Laura. ""But if he's getting a subsidy from society through this tax deduction, then there's a responsibility that goes with it.""
Whether or not Musk donated his Tesla shares to a DAF, Arnold said, the possibility that he did highlights a questionable tax loophole for the wealthy.
""Society is giving them this tax deduction, this subsidy to encourage more resources to get to communities,"" Arnold said. ""But the way that the tax law is structured today, it doesn't necessitate that that happens. You can get the tax deduction today, and there's no requirement for that money ever to get to the community.

21,22-Feb-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla CEO Elon Musk Ramps Up Legal Battle Against SEC,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2631681975/BFD812D457A14912PQ/717?accountid=13946,"A new chapter in the ongoing legal dispute —stemming from a 2018 tweet—between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission opened recently. The dispute is still a watch item for investors in the electric-vehicle giant, who appear more worried about other issues these days.
Tuesday morning, Musk tweeted a response to a tweet which linked to a story about an alleged leak of information by the SEC related to its investigation of the CEO: ""This is just peeling back the first layer of the corruption onion. Stay tuned…""
It's a complicated chain of events that led to Musk's tweet. The Tesla (ticker: TSLA) CEO appears upset at how the SEC has treated him.
The heart of the linked story is a letter, reviewed by Barron's, sent to U.S. Southern District of New York judge Alison Nathan from a lawyer representing Musk. The letter, dated Feb. 21, reviews concerns about SEC conduct. ""It has become clearer and clearer that the Commission is out to retaliate against my clients for exercising their First Amendment rights,"" reads part of the three page letter, adding the SEC has ""weaponized this Court's consent decree for illicit ends.""
The decree referenced relates to a 2018 settlement where Tesla and Musk agreed to each pay $20 million to settle a securities-fraud charge related to Musk's tweet that he could take Tesla private for $420 a share. The decree also required Tesla to set up a system to review and monitor Musk's tweeting.
Musk appears to be looking for some relief from SEC oversight and its recent behavior toward Musk. The SEC declined to comment. Tesla and a lawyer for Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.
Musk's Twitter (TWTR) account has always been a must-read for Tesla investors. It will stay that way unless something unexpected happen. And the 2018 settlement is old news for stock investors. Musk's ongoing battle with the SEC remains a watch item for investors, but it doesn't appear to impacting the stock. Something bigger is at play Tuesday.
Tesla stock is down almost 6% in midday trading Tuesday, and the growing conflict between Russia and Ukraine appears to be the main reason. Tesla shares have traded lower with the market all day. The S&P 500 is down 1.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 1.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite has also dropped 1.4% in Tuesday trading.
Tesla stock tends to be more volatile than the market and other tech stocks. Other EV-related shares are struggling as well. NIO (NIO) American depositary receipts is down 7%. Rivian Automotive (RIVN) shares are down more than 8%. Richly valued, high-growth stocks tend to fall more violently in periods of market turmoil. That idea is playing out again on Tuesday.

22,25-Feb-22,Barron's (Online),Stocks Staged a Huge Turnaround. Markets Now Have a Problem.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2632734773/BFD812D457A14912PQ/739?accountid=13946,"Markets staged an astonishing turnaround on Thursday, given the circumstances.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 850 points lower at one point early in the day, after Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine, but managed to close 92 points up.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite's comeback was even more remarkable , turning a 3.5% loss, and a brief fall into bear market territory, into a 3.3% gain.
The last time the index was down more than 3% at its low but closed more than 3% higher was in November 2008, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
While there was an element of dip-buying, particularly in tech stocks, relief the sanctions imposed by the U.S . and its allies on Russia were less punitive than expected was key to the rebound.
Neither President Joe Biden nor the European Union opted to kick Russia out of the Swift global payment network. That isn't to say they won't eventually—for now it's a sanction the West holds up its sleeve.
There were also no sanctions aimed at Russian oil and gas—although the EU did announce a ban on exports needed to upgrade the country's oil refineries early Friday.
Oil prices have cooled after topping $100 a barre l on Thursday, which will ease investors' concerns over inflation and aggressive rate increases by the Federal Reserve.
The threat and ultimately the fear of sanctions appeared to be the driver behind the market's initial slump, with relief causing the subsequent rally.
The problem for markets is that the crisis in Ukraine is only worsening and the current round of sanctions is unlikely to be the last. The volatility is just beginning.

U.S. Responds to Russia's Ukraine Invasion With More Sanctions
Biden announced a series of additional sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, including freezing Russian assets in the U.S. and restricting activities for large Russian banks, including the country's two largest, Sberbank and VTB Bank.
* The U.S. also will restrict exports of military items and sensitive technology that is crucial to Russia's defense, including semiconductors, telecommunication, encryption securities, lasers, sensors, avionics, and maritime technology.
* Biden told reporters Thursday that sanctions could cut off more than half of Russia's high-tech imports and hamper Russia's efforts to modernize its military and aerospace industry.
* Biden stopped short of cutting Russia off from Swift, the Belgium-based messaging cooperative that links global banks. Some European allies didn't agree to it. Severing the world's 12th-largest economy from the financial system could harm Western business and benefit China, The Wall Street Journal reported.
* Russia and China have been working on their own alternative to Swift. China's Cross-Border Inter-Bank Payments System would enable the two countries, which share a 2,600-mile border, to bypass Swift, the Journal reported.
What's Next: The U.S. also sanctioned several oligarchs who are close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and expanded bans on new sovereign debt to include a prohibition on trading equity in several of the country's largest companies.

Moderna Sees Fourth Covid-19 Vaccine Dose This Fall
Moderna's chief medical officer, Dr. Paul Burton, told investors the company ""firmly"" believes a fourth Covid-19 vaccine dose will be needed by the fall of 2022 to protect against waning vaccine effectiveness. He said the boosters would need to protect specifically against the Omicron and Delta coronavirus variants.
* Moderna's president, Dr. Stephen Hoge, said the company is testing different boosters for the fall, including combining its original vaccine with an Omicron-specific formula. Moderna is also developing new vaccines to prevent herpes and shingles and is working on a cancer vaccine.
* Moderna reported $18.5 billion in revenue and net income of $12.2 billion in 2021. The company delivered 807 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine, and said its share of the U.S. booster market grew to 45% in February, from 27% in October.
* Company executives said coronavirus will become an endemic, seasonal virus in 2023 and beyond. Moderna has signed $19 billion in advanced purchase agreements for 2022, and said it's in ""numerous discussions"" with governments for late 2022 and 2023.
* Starting today, Los Angeles County gyms, bars, restaurants, salons, and offices can allow fully vaccinated customers ages 5 and older to drop their masks indoors, with verification they are fully vaccinated or have recently tested negative. Unvaccinated people must keep wearing masks.
What's Next: The Biden administration is expected to announce significant changes to its federal mask-wearing guidelines today, revised recommendations that mean most people will no longer have to wear masks in indoor public settings, the Associated Press reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.

Morgan Stanley Confirms Federal Probes of Block-Trading Business
Morgan Stanley confirmed that federal investigators have been probing the investment bank's block-trading business. The investment bank said in a regulatory filing that since June 2019 it has been responding to requests for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission. It also said that beginning in August 2021 it has been responding to requests for information from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.
* Federal investigators sent subpoenas to several Wall Street banks, including Morgan Stanley and several hedge funds, in a probe of block trading , The Wall Street Journal reported last week.
* The Journal reported that the SEC sent subpoenas to the firms in its examination of whether bankers might have improperly tipped hedge fund clients ahead of large share sales. The Journal's report cited people familiar with the situation.
* Morgan Stanley was the most active bank in block trades last year, leading more than a quarter of the deals by value and earning more than $300 million in fees, according to data from Dealogic.
What's Next: The bank said it was cooperating with the federal investigations. The opening of the probes or the issuance of subpoenas doesn't mean charges will be brought against any of the firms.

SEC Investigating Stock Sales by Elon Musk, His Brother
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his brother, Kimbal Musk, may have violated insider trading rules with their sales of Tesla stock, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
* The agency is looking into Kimbal Musk's sale of 88,500 shares of Tesla shares valued at $108 million the day before Elon Musk polled his Twitter followers on Nov. 6, asking if he should sell 10% of his stake in the electric-vehicle company.
* Tesla representatives weren't immediately available to comment, and neither was a lawyer for Elon Musk, Barron's reported. An SEC representative declined to comment. A lawyer for Tesla and Musk has accused the SEC of harassing him with ""serial investigations,"" claims that the SEC has rejected.
* After 58% of the more than 3.5 million who responded to the tweet voted that he should sell, Tesla's stock value fell sharply. Elon Musk said that selling his shares would cover taxes he would need to pay if lawmakers enacted new taxes on unrealized capital gains.
* Insider trading rules prohibit employees and board members of public companies from trading on material information that isn't public. It is unclear if Kimbal Musk, who serves on Tesla's board, knew about his brother's tweet before selling his shares.
What's Next: Elon Musk's tweets about the SEC, including that he ""didn't start the fight, but I will finish it,"" have unnerved investors, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who told Barron's the moves amid an escalating conflict in Ukraine has made ""investor angst very high.""

SPACs Hunt for Deals With Precious Time to Spare
Time is precious for hundreds of special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, formed in a hot market in 2020. They are still hunting for acquisitions, including Bill Ackman's $4 billion Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, and could be forced to return investor money if they can't find one.
* About 602 SPACs with a combined $162.4 billion in funds currently are on the hunt , according to data from SPAC Research. The class of 2020 includes 247 SPACs, and just 58% have found and closed acquisitions, Barron's analysis found. Deals are pending for 33.
* SPACs raise money through an initial public offering with the goal of merging with a private company. The IPO money earns interest in a trust until a merger closes. If the SPAC can't find a deal within a specific period, typically two years, the money is returned to investors.
* Retail investors buy shares when a SPAC starts trading, usually at $10 each. But some SPACs that haven't found mergers are trading below $10, presenting an opportunity because investors can redeem the shares for $10 each at the time when a potential merger is voted on, before it's completed.
* Ackman's SPAC canceled plans to buy 10% of Universal Music Group last July. It has until July 24 to close another merger, or until Jan. 24, 2023, with a letter of intent or agreement in principle with a business. Pershing declined to comment.
What's Next: Hundreds of expiring SPACs ""would be good for surviving SPACs, because there will be less competition for them to find acquisitions,"" said Evan Ratner, president of Levin Capital Strategies.

23,25-Feb-22,Los Angeles Times,"BUSINESS; Musk, brother probed by SEC; Agency investigates Kimbal Musk's sale of Tesla stock just before CEO's Twitter poll.",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2632602858/BFD812D457A14912PQ/747?accountid=13946,"The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk and his brother Kimbal violated securities laws when selling shares in the company late last year, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The investigation is focused on transactions that took place just before Elon Musk polled his Twitter followers on whether he should sell a 10% stake in the company. The SEC is looking into whether any insider-trading rules were violated, said the person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the inquiry is private.
The SEC declined to comment. Tesla and Elon and Kimbal Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The inquiry was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

Tesla stock slumped the most in five months after the CEO's Nov. 6 Twitter poll. Kimbal Musk, a Tesla board member, had sold 88,500 Tesla shares worth about $109 million on Nov. 5, according to a filing after the market closed that day.
This month, Tesla disclosed that it had received an SEC subpoena Nov. 16 seeking information about its governance processes and compliance with a settlement it reached with the agency in September 2018 over Elon Musk's tweeting.
As part of that agreement, Tesla pledged to put in place controls to oversee the CEO's communications, including his tweets, after the SEC alleged that he had committed securities fraud by saying on the social media platform that he had secured funding for the company to go private.
Musk and the SEC have been at odds ever since. In 2019, the agency asked a judge to find Musk in contempt of the settlement when he tweeted about Tesla's production outlook without getting prior approval. The two sides agreed in April 2019 to amend their agreement by adding specific topics Musk couldn't tweet about, or otherwise communicate in writing, without running it by a company lawyer.

24,27-Feb-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla CEO Elon Musk Says SpaceX's Starlink Now Active in Ukraine,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2633445496/BFD812D457A14912PQ/722?accountid=13946,"The Ukrainian government asked Tesla CEO Elon Musk for help with its internet amid its war with Russia . Musk answered.
Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's vice prime minister and minister of digital transformation, asked the Tesla (ticker: TSLA) CEO for Starlink stations from SpaceX on Saturday.
The answer came relatively quickly. Fedorov knew where to find Musk. He asked on Twitter, where Musk has amassed more than 75 million followers.
 Starlink is space-based internet service that SpaceX has begun offering. Exactly how many terminals are on the way and how Ukraine officials plan to deploy them isn't known. SpaceX and the Ukrainian government didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Space-based internet service, however, likely is harder to disrupt in war than wired or cell-tower based systems.
There are now more than 2,000 small, Starlink satellites in low-earth orbit. Musk said the service works best in rural areas, but his space company has plans to add to the number and capability of its satellites over time.
SpaceX is privately held, but is valued at roughly $100 billion in private markets. That makes SpaceX one of the top five most valuable aerospace franchises on the planet, right alongside the likes of Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX).
Musk's other large company, Tesla, is publicly traded, of course. Shares have struggled so far in 2022 amid rising geopolitical tensions and higher inflation.
Tesla stock has declined about 23% year to date, worse than the 8% and 6%, comparable respective returns of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Tesla shares closed down 5.5% this past week. It rallied later in the week, along with the rest of the market, but didn't finish in the green like the Nasdaq Composite. The Nasdaq finished the week up 1.1%.

26,4-Mar-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Tesla Gets Approval to Start EV Production in Germany; Formal opening marks next step in Elon Musk's global expansion drive,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2635491246/BFD812D457A14912PQ/675?accountid=13946,"BERLIN—Tesla Inc. has secured local approvals in Germany to formally begin electric-vehicle productions at its new plant outside Berlin , a key pillar of Chief Executive Elon Musk's push to rapidly boost output and sales.
Tesla's plant challenges Europe's established auto makers, who have invested billions over the past few years to develop electric cars and catch up with the U.S. powerhouse.
The approval comes with conditions that Tesla must fulfill before the new vehicles can be driven from the factory to customers, Brandenburg state officials said. Tesla must provide assurances regarding water usage as well as pollution controls, which have been at the forefront of objections to the plant by environmentalists.
The Berlin plant, when fully operational, will have a production capacity to make 500,000 vehicles a year and will initially make Model Y compact crossover vehicles. Tesla produced just under one million vehicles last year globally. The plant is Tesla's third, following Fremont, Calif., and Shanghai. Tesla expects to inaugurate production at a new plant in Austin, Texas, soon.
Tesla's German factory will play a key role in helping the company build market share in Europe, by allowing it to tailor models for local customers. Local production also should allow Tesla to cut costs by reducing the need for expensive shipping and eliminating import duties.
Tesla began production at the facility in 2020, but was hit by a string of delays including environmental opposition and errors by the company in seeking approvals . The factory has been largely complete since late last year, but only got official approval from Brandenburg state government Friday.
When Tesla first approached Brandenburg in 2019 about building a plant near Berlin, the state government was alarmed by how fast Mr. Musk wanted it to go up. Local officials began to refer to the company's aggressive—for Germany—timeline as living on ""Tesla time.""
To accelerate the complex approval process, the state relied on fast-track legislation created after German reunification to attract investment. That allowed Tesla to receive preliminary approval to build the factory in stages, pending final approval at the end of the process.
""This was a mammoth task,"" Brandenburg Prime Minister Dietmar Woidke said. ""Today is a very good day for Brandenburg and, I believe, for all of Germany.""
Brandenburg Economics Minister Jörg Steinbach said the plant would become a magnet for further investment in the region. ""Suddenly we are known, suddenly people are asking about us,"" he said.
Tesla is the world's largest auto maker by market value, but its production is dwarfed by rivals such as Volkswagen AG, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Jeep and Chrysler owner Stellantis NV.
However, it maintains an edge in the fast-growing EV market. In 2021, Tesla was the top-selling fully-electric car maker in Europe with sales of 167,549 vehicles, according to Jato Dynamics, ahead of Volkswagen, which sold 166,357 fully-electric cars, and Renault, which sold 97,129 models. Tesla's Model 3 was the bestselling electric car in Europe last year, handily beating Renault's Zoe and VW's ID.3.
Rival car makers are eyeing Tesla, though. After years of preparation, European auto makers are creating a range of models for potential customers that didn't exist when Teslas first hit the showrooms. Last year, for example, VW's new ID.4 ; the Enyaq, built by VW-owned Skoda; and Fiat's electric 500 model made the biggest gains in market share, according to Jato Dynamics.
Electric vehicles accounted for 10.3% of total new car sales in Europe in 2021. ""Over the last 10 years, pure electric cars have grown faster than any other segment,"" said Felipe Munoz, a Jato analyst.
Tesla also faces potential challenges from Germany's powerful IG Metall labor union, which is eager to organize the Berlin plant. Workers this week elected a council empowered to mediate on behalf of staff over working conditions, but not allowed under German law to engage in collective bargaining.
In addition, environmental activists have sued to block a utility provider from increasing the water it draws from the ground to serve the Tesla plant. If the court sides with the plaintiffs, the water company says it would have a shortfall so large that the entire local community would be affected.

27,5-Mar-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Tesla Wins Approval to Open Its European Plant: [Business/Financial Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2635739446/BFD812D457A14912PQ/473?accountid=13946,"German authorities cleared the plant, which was built near Berlin, to open for production. Tesla plans to build 500,000 electric cars a year there.BERLIN -- German authorities gave the approval on Friday for Tesla to begin production of electric vehicles and battery cells at its first major assembly plant in Europe, after months of delays and disputes, paving the way for the electric car company to begin production of its Model Y sport utility vehicle.The announcement was critical for Tesla, which had raced to begin construction of the $7 billion plant two years ago without waiting for the German bureaucracy, a move that risked having to tear down the plant had the approval not been secured.There was no immediate comment from Tesla after the announcement. Dietmar Woidke, the governor of Brandenberg, the German state near Berlin where the plant is, said the company had set itself a deadline of two weeks to complete the final steps before beginning production.Tesla posted record-breaking sales in 2021, a year when it became the industry's first trillion-dollar automaker. The new plant is expected to expand the company's earnings in Europe, where its cars are already top sellers among electric vehicles. The arrival of the U.S. giant has put Germany's traditional automakers on notice that they must raise their game or lose out to a company seen as much as a tech giant as a competitor.The factory will be Tesla's third assembly plant, alongside ones in Fremont, Calif., and Shanghai. Another is expected to open soon outside Austin, Texas.Tesla has said it plans to produce 500,000 vehicles at the new facility, known as Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg. It took just more than two years for construction to be completed to an extent to begin production -- record time for a major factory in Germany, but slower than the company's chief executive, Elon Musk, had hoped.""This was a mammoth undertaking,"" Mr. Woidke said, announcing that the 537-page administrative notice had been handed to representatives of Tesla on Friday.No one spoke on behalf of Tesla at a news conference announcing the approval, but Mr. Woidke said that representatives of the company wore T-shirts emblazoned with, ""March the Fourth Be With You,"" a play on the slogan from Star Wars. (The Germans wore suits and ties.)The announcement came as a judge in Frankfurt was considering a lawsuit challenging the plant's opening over water issues. Hours after the approval was announced, the judge ruled that authorities had not been thorough enough in their assessment of the planned water use, a victor for local environmentalists, but not one that is expected to derail the plant's ability to open.Christiane Schröder, the regional head of the Nature Protection Federation of Brandenburg, known as NABU, one of the groups that had brought the lawsuit, said they hoped the victory would send a message to authorities about the need to protect groundwater in the region.Even if it will not prevent the opening of the plant from going ahead, she said, ""It sets a precedent.""Mr. Musk had announced he would build the plant -- on a site where, during the days of the communist East Germany, soldiers trained to push back NATO -- at an awards ceremony in Berlin in November 2019. Local authorities, eager to court the Silicon Valley entrepreneur, rushed through building permits in a matter of weeks, instead of the usual timeline that runs in months.But the production began to bog down after Tesla announced last April that it wanted to add a battery production facility to the site, a step that required extra paperwork. Officials for Brandenburg said they received the final documents from Tesla before the end of last year.The plant is already assembling prototypes -- authorities granted the company permission on Jan. 10 to produce 2,000 prototypes, after Tesla said its initial run of 250 test vehicles had been insufficient to bring the plant into full working order. Tesla is not allowed to sell the vehicles and it is not yet clear when the first Model Ys for sale will roll off the factory floor.The company has said the plant will eventually employ more than 12,000 people, and the company is still seeking to fill hundreds of jobs for engineers, operators and managers and others. Mr. Musk has indicated that one attraction of Germany was its auto-making tradition and deep pool of engineering expertise, which he already capitalized on by acquiring a German company specialized in automation and chip production in 2017.Overall, the U.S. automaker sold 34,389 vehicles in Germany in 2021, up from 9,357 in 2019. Until now, the Model Y has been imported from Shanghai. Model 3 Teslas, which last year topped the list of the most popular electric cars in Germany and all of Europe, according to Jato Dynamics, a market research firm, are imported from the United States.The new Tesla plant is about 100 miles east of Wolfsburg, home to the company's biggest German rival in the market for electric vehicles, Volkswagen. Long dominant on the domestic market for cars with combustion engines, the traditional automaker is already scrambling to catch up with its new rival, with plans to build their own new plant dedicated too building electric vehicles.PhotographElon Musk, left, C.E.O. of Tesla, in August with the German politician Armin Laschet at the construction site for Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg.

28,6-Mar-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla CEO Elon Musk Wants the U.S. and the World to Pump More Oil,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2635897595/BFD812D457A14912PQ/721?accountid=13946,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk has taken a surprising stance. He recommended increasing oil production to ease prices.
Musk has built his electric-vehicle company, Tesla (ticker: TSLA), partly to wean the world off fossil fuels and create an economy based on sustainable, renewable energy. But he tweeted Friday that ""extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures,"" adding that while falling energy prices can impact demand for EVs, ""hate to say it, but we need to increase oil and gas output immediately.""
Oil prices have soared as economic sanctions and war threaten Russian oil supplies, sending waves through the global energy market. Benchmark U.S. crude oil prices closed above $115 a barrel Friday, rising 26% for the week.
Rising oil prices have hit consumers at the pump. U.S. average gasoline prices topped $4 a gallon this past week for the first time since 2012.
High gas prices, at the margin, make EVs more attractive than traditional gas-powered vehicles. EVs are more expensive up front. Rechargeable batteries and electric motors still cost more than an engine, transmission and gas tank. But an EV takes roughly $10 to ""fill up"" based on current electricity prices. A similar amount of driving range in a comparable traditional car can cost more than $50.
Tesla stock closed up 3.5% the past week as oil soared and the rest of the market slumped. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both dropped 1.3%. Rising energy prices were part of the story helping Tesla stock in recent days, but so was news that the company's new German car production facility received required government permits to start production.
Musk's energy tweets have drawn more than 25,000 comments. Some disagreed with his stance. The CEO, however, appears to believe that, at least in the short run, the U.S. needs both more oil and more sustainable energy investment. ""Sustainable energy solutions simply cannot react instantaneously to make up for Russian oil & gas exports,"" added Musk.
Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Musk's comments.
It isn't easy for oil producers to simply pump more. Increasing oil output requires capital investment, just like adding wind or solar power generation capacity. RBC head of commodity strategy Helima Croft told Barron's Jack Hough recently that the central banker of oil remains Saudi Arabia. That is the country with spare pumping capacity.

29,6-Mar-22,The Washington Post,Democracy is under threat. Are billionaires to blame?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2635866488/BFD812D457A14912PQ/763?accountid=13946,"During the last two years, millions of Americans have seen their livelihoods and lives upended as a global pandemic has decreased life expectancy, shuttered businesses and schools, added to unemployment, and devastated communities. But one group has been doing quite well: billionaires. The world's 10 richest men doubled their fortunes from $700 billion to $1.5 trillion, according to a report by Oxfam International. Over the same period, more than 160 million people around the world have been pushed into poverty.
It's hard not to feel moral revulsion when gigantic wealth is displayed as extreme poverty and human suffering afflict the globe. But why exactly does this inequality matter? Why not simply focus on ending poverty and leave the rich to their yachts and spaceships?
In ""Davos Man: How the Billionaires Devoured the World,"" Peter S. Goodman delivers a powerful and resounding answer: Outsize wealth is an outsize threat to democracy. Focusing on a handful of billionaire entrepreneurs - Jeff Bezos, Stephen Schwarzman, Marc Benioff, Jamie Dimon and Larry Fink - Goodman, a New York Times economics correspondent, shows how they helped reshape an economy that now works only for the wealthy. (Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Over the last several decades, the rich have clamped down on wages, unions and taxes, building enormous monopolies with expansive political power. Their fortunes have grown while the majority of the U.S. population has faced stagnation or even a decline in living standards. Frustration over this state of affairs has turned parts of the public in an anti-democratic and hyper-nationalist direction.
ProPublica, the nonprofit investigative news organization, obtained IRS records showing that Tesla founder Elon Musk, the second-richest person in the world, paid no federal income taxes in 2018. The very rich often hold their stocks and shares in ways that draw no tax: As Warren Buffet observed, billionaires now pay lower tax rates than their secretaries. And it is not as if they are paying much in corporate taxes, either. By sending profits abroad, companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google have paid little or no U.S. corporate tax. Recently, the leaked Pandora Papers cast further light on the tax havens, shell companies, complex trusts and other tax loopholes used by the super-rich. The wealthy also have an army of professional lobbyists, lawyers and accountants looking for loopholes in the tax code and shaping the rules where they can.
This influence extends beyond the economy: The children of the elite are disproportionately represented at America's most selective colleges and universities, the top 1 percent have access to teams of expensive lawyers in the face of criminal charges, and they wield outsize influence in elections through political contributions and lobbying. The rules that are meant to restrict the power of money in the markets, the political system, the regulatory system and education can all be gamed by the wealthy.
Certainly, many of these billionaires are innovators: It's hard not to be impressed by the business genius of a Jeff Bezos or an Elon Musk. But after innovation mints new billionaires, what should happen next? There is substantial agreement among economists and social scientists that massively successful innovators need to be prevented from blocking the next wave of innovation, which often threatens their dominance.
Goodman's reporting is biting and bitterly funny as he shows just how much the wealthy wish to be admired. His five billionaires are ""Davos"" men, showing up at the World Economic Forum each year in the Swiss Alps, determined to demonstrate their commitment to the common good. As likely to reference Nelson Mandela as Milton Friedman, and to begin their mornings with meditation sessions, these Davos men tout their giving to charity and their commitments to ""stakeholder capitalism."" Unacknowledged, as Goodman wryly notes, are their decades of tax avoidance that weakens state capacity, their roles in the gutting of antitrust laws, their lobbying for tax cuts, their reckless financial gambling with pension funds, their predatory privatization of public services and their opposition to unions.
So, what is to be done? Goodman homes in on one policy solution: taxes, and in particular, a wealth tax. Economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman estimate that a marginal tax rate of 10 percent for wealth over $1 billion would have raised $250 billion from the 400 richest Americans in 2018. Perhaps as important, it would have deconcentrated wealth. Given the analysis above, a wealth tax is certainly a policy worth considering. So is raising the income tax on high incomes. Even if you don't like paying taxes, you should want the tax system to be fair. And we should not forget that the unpaid taxes by the super-rich mean more decaying roads, less money for schools and more uncared-for children.
But would it solve all the problems that ail our democracy? Goodman's analysis would be strengthened by looking at other factors that contribute to the erosion of democracy: the persistence of de facto segregation, unequal opportunity and misinformation. While the billionaires may have had a hand in this, it is not they alone - and tax policy alone will not fix it. We also need to consider policies to raise voter turnout and increase the representation of disadvantaged groups, policies that encourage unions and the use of wage boards to rein in monopsony power, policies to end the restrictive zoning that aims to keep poor people out of wealthier communities. We need to significantly boost investment in pre-K and K-12 education, regulate the Internet, and develop a national jobs policy aimed at reducing unemployment. Goodman keeps his focus on billionaires and says little about alternative explanations for inequality, such as the effects of technology and globalization. Again, Davos Man has certainly had an outsize influence on these factors, but do we know how much inequality would have happened without him?
Balzac reportedly said that behind every great fortune is a great crime. That is, at best, an exaggeration. But ""Davos Man"" shows us that today's extreme wealth is inextricably linked to a great crime, perhaps the greatest one of this century: the hijacking of our democracy.

30,8-Mar-22,Barron's (Online),"Tesla CEO Elon Musk Amps Up Battle With SEC, Contends Funding Was 'Secured'",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2637000633/BFD812D457A14912PQ/720?accountid=13946,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk continues to battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In new filings, Musk insists that funding really was secured and explains why he settled with the SEC anyway.
It's a dramatic twist in the fight between Musk and the government securities regulator which might surprise investors. They aren't selling Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock because of it, though.
On Tuesday, Musk filed papers with the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, to ""quash and terminate consent decree.""
The decree relates to a 2018 settlement with the SEC which resolved an SEC charge that Musk committed securities fraud when he tweeted in August 2018 that he had secured funding to take the company private at $420 a share. That was equivalent to $84 a share, following a subsequent stock split.
That price was far higher than Tesla stock was trading at the time of the tweet—though it has since risen far higher—and the SEC alleged that the claim about the potential deal ""lacked an adequate basis in fact.""
As part of the settlement, Tesla agreed to put in place new oversight to monitor some of Musk's tweets, in addition to modest monetary penalties for the company and the CEO.
In the new filings, Musk declares he was considering taking Tesla private, funding was secured, and there was investor support. ""I never lied to shareholders. I would never lie to shareholders. I entered into the consent decree for the survival of Tesla, for the sake of its shareholders,"" reads part of the document.
The filing by Musk might have been precipitated by an SEC subpoena dated Nov. 29, 2021, that asked him to produce documents related to board oversight of his Twitter usage. The filing accused the SEC of acting ""in bad faith as part of a concerted campaign to target and silence Mr. Musk's speech onmatters of public concern.""
The two filings reviewed by Barron's run to about 36 pages, combined. The party funding the proposed transaction wasn't named. Tesla's market capitalization at the time was roughly $60 billion at the time of the August 2018 tweet. The SEC and Tesla didn't immediately respond to a requests for comment on the filings.
In Tuesday trading, Tesla shares were at $827.21, up 2.8%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively.
The Tuesday stock move shows investors aren't all that concerned with the Musk-SEC spat. The size of the 2018 settlement might have something to do with the reaction. Tesla and Musk each agreed to pay $20 million to settle the suit.
The $40 million total isn't much compared with Tesla's roughly $850 billion market capitalization.
Tesla investors also might not be paying much attention to the news because a lot of other things are going on. A Chinese industry association published Tesla's local delivery figures Tuesday, saying Tesla delivered 56,515 vehicles from its Shanghai plant in February. That is a dip compared with January, but the February results were affected by the Lunar New Year holiday.
And inflation continues to rage , which is a problem for every company, including Tesla. Oil prices were up another 6.9% to almost $130 a barrel in Tuesday trading. And the price of nickel, a metal that goes into some EV batteries, has risen almost 100% over the past two weeks.
Inflation and the surge in commodity prices brought on by Russia's attack on Ukraine have pushed Tesla stock down about 21% year to date and almost 33% from its November 52-week high of more than $1,243 a share.
If things settle down, maybe investors will come back to the SEC issue and evaluate its impact on Tesla stock.

 Tesla CEO Elon Musk Amps Up Battle With SEC, Contends Funding Was 'Secured'

31,8-Mar-22,Washington Examiner,Elon Musk asks judge to terminate 2018 consent decree with SEC,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2637242911/BFD812D457A14912PQ/757?accountid=13946,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk filed a motion Tuesday asking a judge to end a consent decree with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission stemming from a Twitter post regarding the sale of Tesla stock shares. 
Musk argued in a court filing with the New York Southern District Court that the consent decree should be terminated because his ""freedom of speech is infringed"" and the SEC has used it in ""bad faith"" to investigate several tweets from Musk since 2018, including one in which he asserted he had ""funding secured"" to take the company private.
'SMOOTH RIDE': ELON MUSK BUDDIES UP WITH CHINESE AMBASSADOR FOR TESLA STUNT
""The SEC's pursuit of Mr. Musk has crossed the line into harassment, which is quintessential bad faith. Over the past four years, the SEC has engaged in successive investigations of Mr. Musk and his tweets without cease,"" the filing stated. 
The SEC is currently investigating whether Musk and his brother violated securities laws last November regarding a stock sale poll posted to Twitter. 
Last month, Musk filed a complaint with U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan saying the SEC was targeting him and his company with an ""unrelenting investigation"" and failed to pay Tesla shareholders the $40 million obtained from the 2018 settlement. 
In 2018, Musk settled a securities fraud charge with the SEC, agreeing to step down as chairman of Tesla's board and implement ""comprehensive corporate governance,"" among other reforms at the company, according to a news release at the time. In the settlement, Musk was required to obtain preapproval before issuing written communication on specific topics.

The SEC's complaint arose from a tweet from Musk on Aug. 7, 2018, in which he said he could take Tesla's stock private at $420 per share, which the agency said was ""misleading"" and led to Tesla's stock price to jump over 6%. 
Tweets from Musk have rattled markets on several occasions, sending the values of Tesla, cryptocurrency Dogecoin, and others either soaring or into a tailspin — an instability that has resulted in litigation from investors.

32,9-Mar-22,Barron's (Online),"As Biden Blocks Russian Oil, the Next Step May Come From Consumers",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2637191604/BFD812D457A14912PQ/750?accountid=13946,"Investors are increasingly adopting the environmental, social, and corporate governance framework, and now so is the country as a whole, as President Joe Biden announced a ban on purchases of Russian crude oil, natural gas, and coal.
It isn't just a symbolic step. Russian oil accounted for about 10% of U.S. oil imports last year, some 700,000 barrels of oil a day. Even though the move was anticipated, the Brent grade of crude reached a 14-year high , as the U.K. also is looking to halt oil imports after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Asked on the tarmac about his message on U.S. gas prices, Biden bluntly replied, ""They're going to go up."" 
Granted, when adjusted for inflation, gas prices are still far below the record levels of 2008. But inflation was already running north of 7% before the Russian attack and ensuing Western sanctions, so the ban is perilous not just to the economy but Biden's broader political fortunes.
As for ESG, the White House seems willing to trade one authoritarian for multiple authoritarians, looking to Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates for an output boost, so far without success.
Without help from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the fastest way for prices to come down is simple enough: the Russians leaving Ukraine, or a demand-crushing global recession. The latter may be more likely: ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance told Bloomberg Television that we are starting to approach the area where demand destruction will start to occur .

Exodus of U.S. Companies From Russia Continues
McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks, Burger King, PepsiCo, and General Electric have joined the exodus of U.S. companies from Russia. New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli wrote to several companies doing business in Russia urging them to ""seriously consider whether it's worth the risk,"" the Associated Press reported.
* McDonald's is temporarily closing all 850 of its restaurants in Russia and 108 restaurants in Ukraine, but will keep paying its 72,000 workers in both countries. CEO Chris Kempczinski told employees and franchisees in an email: ""We join the world in condemning aggression and violence and praying for peace.""
* Pepsi is suspending beverage sales and capital investments in Russia, but will keep producing milk, baby formula, and baby food, to help support its 20,000 Russian employees and 40,000 agricultural workers. GE is suspending operations other than essential medical equipment and support for power services, the Associated Press reported.
* Coca-Cola is suspending its business in Russia, and Starbucks, which operates 130 franchise-owned cafes in Russia, is stopping all operations there, including shipments of Starbucks products.
* Yum! Brands is suspending operations of KFC company-owned restaurants in Russia and completing an agreement to suspend all Pizza Hut restaurant operations. Burger King is donating profit from its 800 Russian restaurants to relief efforts and giving Ukrainian refugees $2 million in food vouchers.
What's Next: Poland said it would make its Russian-made MiG-29 combat jets available to the U.S. ""ready to deploy—immediately and free of charge."" The aircraft are to be flown to the U.S. Ramstein air base in Germany. Poland called on other North Atlantic Treaty Organization members to follow its lead.

Elon Musk Asks Judge to Quash 2018 SEC Settlement
Tesla CEO Elon Musk is still tussling with the Securities and Exchange Commission, filing papers on Tuesday with the federal district court in New York seeking to ""quash and terminate"" a 2018 settlement with the SEC that required Tesla to monitor some of Musk's tweets.
* Musk settled the SEC's accusations that he committed securities fraud when he tweeted in August 2018 that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share. Because that was higher than Tesla's then-share price, the SEC said the tweet ""lacked an adequate basis in fact.""
* In Tuesday's filings, Musk said he actually was considering taking Tesla private, had really secured the funding, and investors were supportive. ""I would never lie to shareholders. I entered into the consent decree for the survival of Tesla,"" the court filing said.
* Tuesday's filing might have been prompted by an SEC subpoena dated Nov. 29, 2021, asking Musk for documents showing board oversight of his Twitter usage. The filing accused the SEC of attempting ""to target and silence Mr. Musk's speech on matters of public concern.""
* The two filings reviewed by Barron's don't name the party funding the proposed take-private transaction. Tesla's market capitalization was roughly $60 billion at the time of the August 2018 tweet. The SEC and Tesla didn't immediately respond to Barron's requests for comment on the filings.
What's Next: Donna Nagy, an Indiana University law professor, told The Wall Street Journal it would be difficult to quash the settlement. A federal appeals court in Manhattan recently rejected another SEC defendant's request to scuttle a settlement because it curbed his free-speech rights.

Alphabet's Deal for Mandiant Could Unleash Consolidation
Alphabet's plan to acquire cybersecurity software and services company Mandiant for about $5.4 billion could unleash a new wave of deals for security firms by cloud computing competitors such as Amazon.com and Microsoft.
* Alphabet's Google plans to integrate Mandiant into its Google Cloud operations. It would be the second-largest acquisition in Alphabet history and enhance its existing security offerings.
* Microsoft had been pursuing a deal with Mandiant, according to Bloomberg. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said other potential takeover candidates in the security industry include Varonis Systems, Tenable Holdings, CyberArk Software, and Ping Identity Holding.
* With cyberattacks and state-sponsored cyber terrorism growing more frequent, ""Google is doubling down on its cybersecurity footprint at the right time,"" Ives wrote.
* Google usually prefers to build its own products. Buying Mandiant shows the challenges Google would face ""in replicating some of Mandiant's core competencies, particularly advisory services,"" wrote Baird analyst Colin Sebastian.
What's Next: The deal comes as Alphabet faces antitrust lawsuits from the Justice Department and multiple states over allegations of anticompetitive practices. If approved by regulators and shareholders, the acquisition is expected to close later this year.

Biden Asks Agencies to Examine Regulation of Digital Assets
Biden will sign an executive order today that tasks federal agencies with developing comprehensive regulations for digital assets such as Bitcoin. Various agencies have been asked to develop a regulatory framework for the emerging asset class.
* Digital assets surpassed $3 trillion market value last November, up from $14 billion five years ago. A senior administration official said surveys have found that around 16% of adult Americans, or about 40 million people, have invested in, traded, or used cryptocurrencies.
* The official said the U.S. wants to maintain technological leadership and support innovation while at the same time limiting the risks for consumers, businesses, and the financial system.
* The order urges agencies to conduct research and development of a U.S. central bank digital currency if it's considered in the national interest.
* Bitcoin jumped 8.37% Wednesday to $42,164, according to CoinDesk, after a statement posted online from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called for a ""comprehensive approach,"" allaying fears of a sudden regulatory move. The statement was later taken down from the Treasury website. It has been contacted for comment.
What's Next: Current regulation of digital assets is somewhat haphazard. The SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission both oversee the market but there is no consensus on a variety of issues. Agencies have six months to come up with proposals.

Stitch Fix Stock Falls After Cutting Financial Guidance
Stitch Fix shares continued to fall Wednesday, after the online apparel retailer chopped its financial forecasts for the full year, saying revenue may decline. The shares were down more than 23% in premarket trading.
* Stitch Fix said it was having some issues ""onboarding"" clients to Freestyle, a newer online shopping service, different than its current ""fix"" style experience.
* For the April quarter, Stitch Fix sees revenue ranging from $485 million to $500 million, down between 7% and 10% from a year ago, and well below the Wall Street consensus for $560.5 million. The company sees an adjusted Ebitda loss for the quarter of between $25 million and $30 million.
* For the fiscal second quarter ended Jan. 29, Stitch Fix posted revenue of $517 million, up 3% from a year ago, and within the range of $505 million to $520 million management had told investors to expect. The company lost $30.9 million, or 28 cents a share, in the quarter, in line with consensus.
What's Next: CEO Elizabeth Spaulding said the company continues ""to experience challenges."" Retailers often have teething problems converting clients to new systems, and as long as the issue isn't more fundamental, the stock has the potential to recover.

Dear Quentin,
My sister and I are in our early 30s. She still has trouble understanding that other family members' money is not her money. We come from a solidly upper-middle-class family. My parents had saved and put together an estate of $7 million by the time my dad retired 10 years ago.
For my sister, enough is never enough. It never mattered how much she got or how nice of a vacation we went on—there was always someone else who seemed like they were getting more from their parents than we were, and she would regularly complain about Mom and Dad being ""stingy"" and ""not turning the tap on.""
We lent her money that she never paid back, and probably never planned on it. I try to get together with my nephew once a week, and she just started showing up and has made herself part of it when she found out I took him to lunch after preschool. She started suggesting I take them to places that cost $200 for lunch.
Most recently, she was trying to convince me to pay for her and her son to fly down to California and go to Legoland. I was hoping you might have some suggestions as to how to protect oneself in a situation like this—where the goal is to keep a relationship with my sister, but to set boundaries so she doesn't see me as an ATM.

33,10-Mar-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk Has Sold Seven Homes for Nearly $130 Million After Vowing to 'Own No House'; The Tesla CEO now rents in Texas after selling his California homes to Unlimint founder Kirill Evstratov, Chinese billionaire William Ding and others",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2637613839/BFD812D457A14912PQ/746?accountid=13946,"It's been almost two years since Elon Musk announced a plan to sell nearly all of his physical possessions, including his real estate, by tweeting ""Will own no house"" on May 1, 2020. The billionaire Tesla Inc. and SpaceX CEO has finally unloaded all seven of the houses he once owned in California.
When The Wall Street Journal first reported on his portfolio back in 2019, Mr. Musk, and limited-liability companies tied to him, had amassed a cluster of six houses on two streets in the ""lower"" and ""mid"" areas of the Los Angeles neighborhood of Bel-Air, a celebrity-filled, leafy enclave near the Hotel Bel-Air. He also owned a grand, 100-year-old estate in Northern California in Hillsborough. He purchased the homes between December 2012 and January 2019 for a total of $102 million.
Between June 2020 and November 2021, Mr. Musk sold all seven houses for a total of roughly $127.9 million, making a profit of around $25 million, although he had mortgages on several of the houses at the time, according to PropertyShark and public records.
The buyers include Kirill Evstratov, the 37-year-old founder and CEO of financial tech company Unlimint, splashy L.A. developer Ardie Tavangarian, and William Ding, the Chinese billionaire and founder of mobile gaming company NetEase. Mr. Musk sold another one of his properties, the former home of the late actor and director Gene Wilder, to Mr. Wilder's 53-year-old nephew, Jordan Walker-Pearlman. To date, none of the new owners have significantly altered the properties they bought from Mr. Musk. At least two say they don't expect to make any significant changes in the future.
""I plan to keep the house as it is,"" says Mr. Evstratov, who paid $30 million this past December for Mr. Musk's Hillsborough estate. Unlimint, a London-based company formerly known as Cardpay.com, is planning to open a San Francisco office later this year, but Mr. Evstratov says the house is for his own private use.
Neighbors say that since Mr. Evstratov bought the Hillsborough property, it has been almost eerily quiet, with little traffic going to the house. That is a big shift from the almost-monthly loud parties and the parade of construction vehicles and Teslas that occurred when Mr. Musk owned the house, the neighbors say. Mr. Musk didn't respond to requests for comment.
Of all the buyers, Mr. Walker-Pearlman is the least likely to change anything, even the décor. He has added only a few furnishings since October 2020, when he paid $7 million for the Bel-Air house where he spent time with his uncle growing up.
Mr. Walker-Pearlman discovered the home was on the market when a friend sent him a screenshot of Mr. Musk's tweet, which said he would sell the Wilder house only on the condition that it wouldn't be ""torn down or lose any of its soul.""
""I decided to write to Elon to see if he'd consider selling it to me,"" says Mr. Walker-Pearlman, who negotiated for four months to buy it.
Four of Mr. Musk's houses in Bel-Air went to Mr. Tavangarian, 63, who is known for his massive spec houses in Los Angeles. Mr. Tavangarian says he's considering combining the four properties, but whether he follows through depends on permitting and entitlements. ""We are looking at all the options,"" he says. ""We are going through the process of what it takes to build in L.A.""
Mr. Tavangarian paid around $62 million in December 2020 for the houses, which are on two different streets and range from a two-story white brick Colonial to a glassy contemporary. An area of steeply sloped, empty land lies between the two streets.
For the moment, Mr. Tavangarian says, ""I have my people staying there."" The only visible difference from Mr. Musk's ownership is that the houses now have big signs out front reading ""Arya,"" the name of Mr. Tavangarian's development company.
Meanwhile, Mr. Musk says he has downsized his life. ""My primary home is literally a ~50k house in Boca Chica/Starbase that I rent from SpaceX,"" he tweeted in June 2021, referring to a Texas town near the Mexican border near SpaceX's rocket-launch facility. ""It's kinda awesome though.""
He has been reported as denying reports from real-estate agents who say he has been looking to buy property in Austin, Texas, and Tahoe, Calif. The Wall Street Journal reported in December 2021 that he had been living in a waterfront estate in Austin owned by a rich friend. After that article was published, the friend said Mr. Musk was only a guest and Mr. Musk told the Insider website he did not currently live there. According to records, Mr. Musk is registered to vote in Cameron County, Texas, where the small house he's renting is located.
Here's a rundown of what has happened to each property.
Location: Hillsborough, Calif.
Musk Purchase Price: $23.364 million
Musk Sale Price: $30 million
Buyer: Kirill Evstratov
Mr. Evstratov bought the house, known as de Guigne Court, in November 2021. Located on a leafy hilltop roughly 20 minutes south of San Francisco and north of Silicon Valley, the property had been in the same family for about 150 years. The approximately 16,000-square-foot, Mediterranean-style house sits on 47.4 acres and has five bedrooms, a ballroom and a flower-arranging room. Before Mr. Musk bought it in 2017, it was owned by Christian de Guigne IV, whose grandparents built the home; the family said it was designed by San Francisco architects Bliss & Faville around 1912. The main house has a staff wing with six bedrooms. A pavilion with 18th-century Chinese wallpaper overlooks the pool.
Mr. Evstratov describes himself as a serial entrepreneur. His first company was a small software company in Hong Kong that specialized in billing software for various industries. He started Cardpay in 2009 and changed the name to Unlimint in 2020, part of what he calls a massive rebranding. He says he also has ""a number of startups that focus on various cutting-edge technologies.""
Mr. Evstratov knows the Bay Area from the time he lived in Palo Alto while attending Stanford University's business school. He says that experience played a big role in his decision to buy Mr. Musk's house. ""I had an amazing time there,"" he says. ""I got to meet great people that I am still in contact with, and learn from fantastic professors. I can definitely say that that period of my life played a huge part in my decision to return to the Bay Area.""
Location: Los Angeles
Musk Purchase Price: $6.75 million
Musk Sale Price: $7 million, with a $6.7 million loan to the buyers
Buyers: Jordan Walker-Pearlman and Elizabeth Hunter
This Bel-Air property, spanning roughly 2,756 square feet between the ranch house and a guest cottage, was once owned by Mr. Wilder, who bought it in 1976 for $314,000. The Elon Musk Revocable Trust bought the property in 2013. Located above the Bel-Air Country Club, the house was across the street from Mr. Musk's main residence at the time, and real-estate agents say he wanted to protect his view. Mr. Musk used the house for parties; Ad Astra, the school Mr. Musk started for his five sons (a pair of twins and a set of triplets), was registered at this address at one point.
Growing up, Mr. Walker-Pearlman lived with his uncle at the house during summers and several other months during the year. He says he has vivid memories of Mr. Wilder's morning swims in the kidney-shaped pool, the Sunday after-tennis hangouts with the likes of Mel Brooks and Sidney Poitier, raucous dinner parties, and listening to Mr. Wilder read scripts and play piano.
When a friend sent him a screenshot of Mr. Musk's tweet about wanting to preserve it, Mr. Walker-Pearlman reached out to Mr. Musk's team immediately. Mr. Musk agreed to sell the house to Mr. Walker-Pearlman and his wife, Elizabeth Hunter, for $7 million along with what's called a ""long form deed of trust and assignment of rents,"" agreeing to loan the couple $6.7 million, according to public documents accessed through PropertyShark.
Location: Los Angeles
Musk Purchase Price: A total of $54.95 million for four houses
Musk Sale Price: A total of $61.88 million
Buyer: Ardie Tavangarian
In 2015, Mr. Musk paid $20 million for a six-bedroom, roughly 7,026-square-foot house on a 3.41-acre lot in Bel-Air through Camellia Ranch LLC. Originally built in 1954, this house had last sold for $5.087 million in 2004 before Mr. Musk bought it.
That same year, Duck Duck Goose, an LLC that shares addresses with the Musk Foundation and the headquarters of SpaceX, bought a modest ranch house on an adjacent street up a steep canyon for $4.3 million. A year later, another LLC tied to Mr. Musk bought a large, unfinished, white contemporary three doors down, and then, a little more than two years later, a different LLC also registered to the SpaceX headquarters address snagged a white brick Colonial next to that.
All three houses sit on a cul-de-sac of five homes, making neighbors wonder whether Mr. Musk—or SpaceX—was trying to take over the whole end of the street.
Mr. Tavangarian, originally from Iran, came to the United States as an exchange student when he was 15 years old. He says he came to L.A. to attend the Southern California Institute of Architecture. He is known for selling over-the-top homes. In 2019, a house he built in the Bel-Air area sold to a Chinese buyer for $75 million . In July 2021, he sold a spec house for $83 million. ""My focus is on creating dreams,"" he says.
Location: Los Angeles
Musk Purchase Price: $17 million
Musk Sale Price: $29 million
Buyer: William Ding
In 2012, after three years of renting it, the Elon Musk Revocable Trust bought a 20,248-square-foot, white stucco Colonial mansion with seven bedrooms and 13 bathrooms in Bel-Air from Mitchell Julis, co-founder of hedge fund Canyon Capital Advisors, according to public records. The 1.7-acre property, which Mr. Musk used as his main home, overlooks Bel-Air Country Club, according to the listing at the time, and includes a lighted tennis court, five garages, a pool and spa, gym and guest quarters. The house, resembling a French country estate, has a two-story library and a wine cellar that holds 1,000 bottles.
In June 2020, Mr. Musk sold it via a ""for sale by owner"" listing to an LLC tied to Mr. Ding, public records show. Mr. Ding, whose net worth is around $26 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, wasn't available for comment. The grounds include a fruit orchard, a motor court and a five-car garage, according to the listing.

 Elon Musk Has Sold Seven Homes for Nearly $130 Million After Vowing to 'Own No House'

34,14-Mar-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk Says Tesla, SpaceX Facing 'Significant' Inflationary Pressure; Billionaire also offers advice, saying it's better to own home or stock in companies during high inflation; 'I still own & won't sell my bitcoin, ethereum or doge'",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2638729199/BFD812D457A14912PQ/744?accountid=13946,"Billionaire Elon Musk said his two companies Tesla Inc. and SpaceX are facing substantial inflationary pressure and that he has no plans to sell his cryptocurrency holdings.
Mr. Musk, the world's richest person by net worth, said in a tweet Sunday that both the electrical-vehicle maker and the space-exploration company ""are seeing significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials & logistics.""
His comments come after government data released last week showed consumer prices jumped at a 7.9% annual rate last month, the highest in four decades. And a separate poll by The Wall Street Journal showed nonwhite voters were more likely to say the recent inflation is causing a big financial strain on their lives.
""As a general principle, for those looking for advice from this thread, it is generally better to own physical things like a home or stock in companies you think make good products, than dollars when inflation is high,"" Mr. Musk said on Twitter.
""I still own & won't sell my Bitcoin, Ethereum or Doge fwiw,"" he added.
The price of bitcoin was recently trading at around $39,000, according to CoinDesk. It is down by roughly half from its all-time high in November.
Mr. Musk's net worth is $206 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index .
Mr. Musk's comments on inflation come as rising energy, food and services prices are the key components driving inflation higher. Oil and commodity market disruptions from the Ukraine crisis are expected to add more cost pressures in the coming months. The last time consumer prices were this high was in January 1982 during a recession.
In one of his tweets, Mr. Musk asked his 77.7 million followers what their thoughts were about the probable inflation rate over the next few years. Inflation expectations are important because how people perceive future price moves can play a role in actual inflation and determining how and when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.
 A report released Monday showed households in February expect 6% inflation a year from now, a new record and up from 5.8% in January, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ""The increase was widespread across age, education, and income groups, but largest for the respondents without a high-school diploma,"" the bank said.
Inflation is being felt from consumers to businesses. More than 350 companies in the S&P 500 cited inflation during their earnings calls for the latest quarter, according to financial-data provider FactSet, the most since at least 2010.
Mr. Musk's comments echoed Tesla's recent results as well. The company said higher logistics costs and materials prices weighed on profit last year .
Other companies have been feeling similar pressures , from soda maker Coca-Cola Co. to consumer products company Procter & Gamble Co.
""Inflationary and supply chain pressures continue to impact costs across several fronts in the business, including input costs, transportation, marketing and operating expenses,"" Coca-Cola Chief Financial Officer John Murphy told analysts on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call last month.
P&G, the maker of Pampers diapers and Tide laundry detergent, said it expected inflationary pressure to continue .
""Availability of materials remain stretched in some categories and in some markets, inflationary pressures are broad-based with little sign of near term relief,"" Andre Schulten, chief financial officer at P&G, said on the company's second-quarter earnings call in January.

35,14-Mar-22,Barron's (Online),China's Covid-19 Lockdown Is the Wrong Risk at the Wrong Time,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2638683110/BFD812D457A14912PQ/761?accountid=13946,"Just when it seemed global risks might be peaking, a new but all-too-familiar fear is back.
Covid-19 cases are surging again in China. Chinese authorities imposed a lockdown of the southern city of Shenzhen on Sunday and implemented fresh restrictions in Shanghai, the country's most populous city. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled 5% Monday, as tech stocks in particular were taking a hammering. JD.com slumped close to 15% and Alibaba fell 11%. Russia asking China for military equipment in Ukraine, according to a U.S. official , was also a factor in the rout.
The lockdown of Shenzhen, China's tech hub, has wider global implications that are already coming into play. Apple supplier Foxconn suspended operations at its Shenzhen sites, according to multiple reports . The city's ports are also among the busiest in the world.
The Shenzhen lockdown is due to last until March 20, but given what we know about Covid-19 that date is far from certain.
With inflation surging, the world doesn't need further supply-chain problems.
If nothing else at this stage, it's yet another factor for the Federal Reserve to weigh up at the start of a crucial week for the central bank. The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates by 25 basis points when it announces its decision later this week, but the big question remains how many times it will hike them in 2022.
Inflation will be key to that answer. For now, inflationary pressures continue to mount.

Biden Approval Ratings on Ukraine Jump as Conflict Escalates
President Joe Biden's approval rating for handling Russia and Ukraine has improved 5 percentage points to 46% from last week, according to a CBS News poll, as the U.S. pledged to send another $200 million in weapons and defense aid to Ukraine.
* Russian missiles hit a Ukrainian military training center 10 miles from the Polish border, killing 35 people, the farthest west Russian forces have attacked since they invaded Ukraine in February. Russia said it considers arms deliveries to Ukraine legitimate targets, The Wall Street Journal reported.
* U.S. journalist and documentary filmmaker Brent Renaud, 50, died near the front line in Irpin, Ukraine. Time magazine said in a statement that he was in the region working on a Time Studios project focused on the global refugee crisis. About 2.6 million people have fled Ukraine.
* In two national polls, 77% of Americans support U.S. bans on Russia's oil and gas. CBS News found 63% support sanctions despite higher gasoline prices. Gasoline is averaging $4.31 a gallon, up 25 cents from last week.
* Dana Peterson, the Conference Board's chief economist, told Barron's global growth will shrink by 0.4 to 0.9 percentage points this year, with inflation increasing by 0.7 to 2.7 percentage points with the absence of resources from Russia and Ukraine such as energy, food, metals, and rare earths.
What's Next: National security adviser Jake Sullivan will travel to Rome today to meet with his counterpart from China, Yang Jiechi, to discuss U.S.-China relations and the Russia-Ukraine war. North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense ministers will meet in Brussels on Wednesday.

Federal Reserve Meets on Rates This Week Amid Slowing Signs
The Federal Reserve is getting ready to kick off its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday as inflation is running at four-decade highs. Chair Jerome Powell, still awaiting confirmation for his nomination to a second term, has already signaled a quarter-point interest-rate increase.
* What is more interesting is what Powell may say about the central bank's outlook. The Federal Open Market Committee last published a forecast in December for economic growth of 4% in 2022.
* The Atlanta Fed's latest GDPNow first-quarter growth estimate is predicting an annual rate of 0.5%. With flat growth, or worse, in the current quarter, the fear of a 1970s-style stagflation grows more real.
* Inflation is running at the fastest pace in four decades, with the consumer-price index up an annualized 7.9% in February. Despite unemployment under 4%, consumer sentiment fell to the lowest level since 2011 and inflation expectations rose to the highest level since 1981.
* Bank of America card data showed households across the income spectrum have increased their spending on gas, but lower-income consumers have in exchange reduced their spending on clothing and furniture.
What's Next: Goldman Sachs shifted its U.S. economic forecast for 2022 because of the geopolitical conflict in Russia and Ukraine, now seeing growth of 1.75%, down from 2%. The probability of a recession later this year is 20% to 35%, the bank said.

Elon Musk Says He Isn't Selling His Crypto Holdings
Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and Ether briefly spiked Monday, after Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he still owns the cryptocurrencies and won't be selling. Musk had posted a question on Twitter about his thoughts on the likely rate of inflation over the next few years.
* Dogecoin rose nearly 4%, according to CoinDesk, before paring those gains. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, rose and Ether, the token underpinning the Ethereum blockchain network, also gained.
* ""As a general principle, for those looking for advice from this thread, it is generally better to own physical things like a home or stock in companies you think make good products, than dollars when inflation is high,"" Musk tweeted.
* He added ""I still own & won't sell my Bitcoin, Ethereum or Doge fwiw.""
What's Next: On the inflation question, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor replied by predicting weaker currencies will collapse, and ""the flight of capital from cash, debt, and value stocks to scarce property like Bitcoin will intensify."" Musk responded saying that response was ""not entirely unpredictable.""

Berkshire Hathaway Buys More Shares of Occidental Petroleum
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway continued to snap up Occidental Petroleum shares last week, increasing its stake in the energy company to $6.9 billion , according to a regulatory filing. Berkshire now owns 118.3 million shares of Occidental, or 12.7%.
* Occidental shares have benefited as oil and natural-gas prices surged in recent weeks. From Wednesday through Friday, Berkshire bought 27.1 million shares of Occidental, about $1.6 billion, including about 24 million shares on Wednesday.
* Barron's on Thursday reported speculation that Berkshire was buying Occidental stock. Berkshire also holds 83.9 million warrants to purchase Occidental stock at a strike price of $59.62. Occidental shares closed Friday at $57.95.
* Berkshire, which held less than 30 million shares of Occidental on March 1, has bought nearly 90 million shares since then. Occidental's stock is up 31% so far in March, well ahead of the broader energy sector, the Energy Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund, and up 89.2% over the past 12 months.
* Berkshire's Class B stock is up 9% so far this year, and its Class A stock is also up 9% to a 52-week high, trouncing the S&P 500, which has lost 12% this year as investors seek havens in a rocky market.
What's Next: Occidental produces about 1.2 million barrels of oil equivalent daily and has been an industry leader in carbon capture. Berkshire, which usually accumulates stock quietly over time, didn't respond immediately to Barron's request for comment.

Slim Pickings for Drivers Looking for Better Fuel Efficiency
Soaring gasoline prices are spurring more consumers to look for more fuel-efficient cars , just as dealers' inventories of new and used cars are at historic lows, offering buyers slim pickings. Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. ban on Russian oil, and related issues have accelerated surging fuel prices.
* Dealers and analysts say buyers are more interested in hybrids, electric vehicles, and smaller cars. That follows years of demand for bigger, more-profitable pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles. Auto makers stopped making compact cars such as the Ford Fiesta, Honda Fit, and Toyota Yaris.
* Nearly 78% of all vehicles sold in 2021 were trucks and SUVs, up from 55% of total U.S. sales a decade ago, according to Wards Intelligence data. Barely one million vehicles were in stock at U.S. dealerships in February, with most already sold, compared with 2.7 million in February 2021.
* Honda Motor, Toyota Motor, and Hyundai Motor kept making their small cars and sedans, but they also don't have many in stock, said Jessica Caldwell, an auto analyst at Edmunds.
* ""We're all in on EVs,"" said Mike Stanton, president of the National Automobile Dealers Association. ""We just don't have the product right now."" Buyers often wait months and pay $15,000 more for EVs from Tesla and Ford Motor, car-shopping company Edmunds.com said.
What's Next: Honda Motor and Toyota Motor both recently announced production curtailments because of a lack of parts, Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner wrote, saying Toyota is pausing to let struggling suppliers catch up, and Honda has semiconductor shortages.

37,17-Mar-22,The New York Observer,This Indian Billionaire’s Wealth Grew More Than Elon Musk’s and Jeff Bezos’s Combined,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2640162911/BFD812D457A14912PQ/756?accountid=13946,"Indian coal tycoon Gautam Adani’s fortune swelled by 18 times in the past 10 years. Manoj Verma/Hindustan Times via Getty Images
In 2021, India’s superrich got richer significantly faster than their American counterparts thanks to a booming Indian stock market and hot IPO deals, according to the 2022 Hurun Global Rich List, an annual ranking of the world’s billionaires compiled by wealth research firm Hurun India.
The most notable figure on this year’s list is India’s second richest person, Gautam Adani, who saw his fortune swell by 153 percent to $81 billion last year. The gain—in both dollar amount and percentage—was greater than that of the world’s top two richest men, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, combined.
Adani, 59, is the founder of Indian energy conglomerate Adani Group, whose businesses span from coal mining to natural gas production to port management. Much of Adani’s wealth gain last year was driven by his company’s stellar stock performance. During 2021, Adani Group shares—traded on the National Stock Exchange of India—soared nearly 250 percent, fueled by its investment in the renewable energy sector. The group’s subsidiary, Adani Green Energy, is the world’s largest solar power developer, according to Indian news site Livemint.
Adani’s wealth accumulation over a longer time span is even more impressive. In the past decade, his net worth increased 18 fold, largely thanks to a series of IPOs of companies owned by Adani Group, according to the Hurun list. Adani was the world’s 12th richest person at the end of 2021 on Hurun’s ranking. He is currently the world’s 11th richest, according to Bloomberg’s real-time Billionaires Index.
In contrast, Musk, who became the world’s richest person in 2020, gained a meager 4 percent in net worth last year, while Bezos’ fortune shrank by 1 percent, per Hurun’s calculation. The majority of Musk’s and Bezos’ wealth is stock ownership in their respective companies: Tesla and Amazon. Both companies’ stocks had a relatively muted year in 2021—Tesla shares were up about 20 percent, while Amazon was up less than 3 percent.
On a grander scale, India’s stock market also consistently outperformed U.S. markets in the past two years. In 2021, India’s leading stock benchmark BSE SENSEX gained 21 percent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 18 percent. Since the global pandemic low in March 2020, BSE SENSEX has doubled, while Dow is up 77 percent. Both indices include 30 prominent companies listed on their respective exchanges.
In 2021, India also had its first centibillionaire (in US dollars): Mukesh Ambani, owner of industrial conglomerate Reliance Industries. Last year, Ambani’s fortune grew by 24 percent to $103 billion (thanks to Reliance’s strong stock), which made him the richest person in India—also Asia. But that could change soon as Adani’s net worth continues to surge this year. Ambani and Adani are both worth nearly $90 billion now, according to Bloomberg’s ranking.
“Over the last 10 years, Indian billionaires added circa $700 billion to their cumulative wealth—this is equivalent to Switzerland’s GDP and twice the GDP of the UAE!” Anas Rahman Junaid, chief researcher of this year’s Hurun list, said in a statement."
38,20-Mar-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk's Business Ties to China Create Unease in Washington; Tesla, SpaceX are at the center of discussions; some lawmakers fear Beijing could access secrets as 'Congress doesn't have good eyes on this'",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2640720649/BFD812D457A14912PQ/741?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk's ties to China are causing unease in Washington, including among some Republican lawmakers who have been among the billionaire entrepreneur's ardent supporters.
The concerns center on the potential for China to gain access to the classified information possessed by Mr. Musk's closely held Space Exploration Technologies Corp., including through SpaceX's foreign suppliers that might have ties to Beijing.
Some lawmakers also are troubled by the lack of clear lines between SpaceX and auto maker Tesla Inc., which also is run by Mr. Musk and has extensive operations in China. Tesla has developed advanced battery packets sought by the Chinese, and China has adopted a less-expensive battery technology championed by Mr. Musk.
The concerns come amid a fierce rivalry between the U.S. and China that recently has been stoked by China's focus on space technology. Tensions are also rising because of Chinese President Xi Jinping's partnership with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Rep. Chris Stewart (R., Utah), is seeking confidential briefings on Capitol Hill with officials from agencies including the National Reconnaissance Office, which coordinates the launch of intelligence satellites, to determine whether the Chinese government has any direct or indirect links to SpaceX.
""I am a fan of Elon Musk and SpaceX, but anyone would be concerned if there are financial entanglements with China,"" said Mr. Stewart, a senior member of the House Intelligence Committee. ""Congress doesn't have good eyes on this.""
Representatives of Mr. Musk, SpaceX and Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Stewart also wants to find out whether any companies with Chinese ties have invested in SpaceX, which isn't publicly traded.
Tesla is publicly held, and in 2017 Chinese technology giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. disclosed that it bought 5% of the car maker's stock . Mr. Musk said it was more than just an investment : In announcing the development, he tweeted that he was ""glad to have Tencent as an investor and advisor to Tesla.""
Tencent disclosed in 2018 that its ownership dropped to 4.97% , with no further disclosures since. When asked if Tencent still owns Tesla stock, a Tencent representative said he couldn't provide any information.
Tencent owns the WeChat messaging app that former President Donald Trump sought to ban in the U.S., and which remains under a security review by the Biden administration.
China is one of Tesla's biggest markets , thanks in large part to support of China's Communist Party and Mr. Xi. Chinese authorities gave Mr. Musk low-interest loans, cheap land and other incentives for a Shanghai facility that opened in 2019 where Tesla vehicles and battery packs are assembled.
In 2018 and early 2019, Tesla was facing financial problems as its U.S. manufacturing plant failed to produce enough cars to meet expectations and the company ran low on funds.
In 2019 and 2020, Tesla received two loans from Chinese banks, according to the company's 2021 annual report, including a $1.4 billion facility to help with construction of its factory in Shanghai. Last year, Tesla paid back $614 million it owed the banks under the agreements and terminated both facilities, the company said.
The White House declined to comment on potential security risks from Mr. Musk's China ties.
Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, whose department shares responsibility for safeguarding U.S. technology, said U.S. companies need to take extra care in dealing with China.
""It's certainly true that China's coercive practices, anticompetitive practices, practices trying to steal our IP or steal our technology and know-how are well documented,"" she said. ""And so any businessperson doing business with China should be extremely wary. And I hope would never engage in any behavior that puts our national security at risk.""
The Chinese embassy didn't respond to a request for comment.
Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, introduced a bill in December to address the threat of China gaining access to space technology secrets via third parties.
The bill would bar the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other U.S. government agencies from awarding contracts to companies with suppliers who have ties to China, and would require more disclosure of Chinese investments in U.S. companies involved in the private space-launch industry.
""Any company operating in China is going to be pressured and exploited by the Chinese Communist Party,"" Mr. Rubio said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal, referring to Mr. Musk's Tesla operations in China.
Mr. Rubio is a top recipient of campaign donations from Mr. Musk, and Florida is home to several launch facilities, including NASA's Kennedy Space Center, that SpaceX uses.
The concerns over potential security risks have been exacerbated by Mr. Musk's praise for China, lawmakers said. Along with being seen as a security threat, China has aligned itself with Russia and has been accused of oppressing Uyghur minorities in its remote Xinjiang region, an accusation that Beijing disputes.
On Dec. 31, Mr. Musk opened a showroom in the Xinjiang capital of Urumqi, just a few weeks after President Biden signed a bill approved by Congress to require U.S. companies that import products from Xinjiang to prove that they weren't manufactured with forced labor.
""Nationless corporations are helping the Chinese Communist Party cover up genocide and slave labor in the region,"" read a tweet from the Senate office of Mr. Rubio, responding to Mr. Musk's move.
Earlier this month, Mr. Musk hosted China's ambassador to the U.S., Qin Gang, at Tesla's factory in Fremont, Calif. ""Had an inspiring talk with @elonmusk today,"" Mr. Qin tweeted afterward, ""on cars on the road, stars in the sky, research of human brain, meaning of life on earth and our future into the space.""
On the 100th anniversary last year of China's Communist Party, Mr. Musk tweeted that the ""economic prosperity that China has achieved is truly amazing, especially in infrastructure!""
""China rocks in my opinion,"" Mr. Musk said in a July 2020 podcast from Automotive News. ""People there—there's a lot of smart, hardworking people…whereas I see in the United States increasingly much more complacency and entitlement.""
Former Republican Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado called such comments ""tone deaf to the legitimate national security concerns that members of Congress have.""
In 2019, Mr. Gardner tried to add a provision to NASA-related legislation that would have required the space agency to consider whether SpaceX or other U.S. space-launch companies had financial ties to Chinese and foreign-controlled companies.
After members of the Senate Commerce Committee agreed to include Mr. Gardner's provision, lobbyists for SpaceX undertook an effort to successfully kill the bill, Mr. Gardner said.
""We had heard through the grapevine that it was SpaceX, but we never heard from them directly,"" said Mr. Gardner, who lost his 2020 reelection campaign.
Several Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee are also wary of Mr. Musk's ties to China and are monitoring his moves, according to a committee aide.
Like Republicans, Democrats have mixed views on Mr. Musk. Many Democrats praise him for building enthusiasm for electric vehicles and championing efforts to address climate change. At the same time, Tesla uses a nonunion workforce, displeasing Mr. Biden and other pro-union Democrats. Tesla is the world's leading electric-vehicle maker, but Mr. Musk wasn't among the auto executives invited to the White House last year for an event to rally support for the industry.
Many Republicans, meanwhile, remain fans of Mr. Musk for challenging federal regulators on some issues, and they have praised him for creating competition in the space-launch industry.
""Tesla and SpaceX are great American companies. And Elon is one of our country's greatest innovators and a true patriot,"" said Matt Sparks, a spokesman for House Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), an early champion of Mr. Musk.
""There is absolutely nothing to suggest forced technology transfers of any kind, whether at Tesla or SpaceX,"" Mr. Sparks said.

 Elon Musk's Business Ties to China Create Unease in Washington 
Credit: By Brody Mullins and Susan Pulliam "
39,21-Mar-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla CEO Elon Musk Is Working on Master Plan 3. The Stock Is Jumping.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2640980868/BFD812D457A14912PQ/732?accountid=13946,"A Thursday tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk , plus more on Monday, seem to be helping the stock . All the Thursday tweet says is ""working on Master Plan Part 3,"" but people who follow the electric-vehicle company know exactly what Musk is talking about.
Part 3 of the master plan would follow Part Deux, published in 2016 , and Part 1, written by Musk in 2006 . Plan 1 called for a low-volume car that would be expensive, but would help the company to build a medium-volume vehicle. Those cars are, essentially, the Model S and the Model 3, respectively, although the Model 3 arguably is better than a medium-volume seller.
Part Deux—Tesla's (ticker: TSLA) website uses the French name in an apparent reference to a 1993 parody film, Hot Shots, staring Charlie Sheen—laid out plans to integrate energy generation and storage into the business, as well as to scale up the volume of production. Tesla has, essentially, done both.
The company sells utility-grade and residential-grade battery backup energy-storage products. And it has four manufacturing plants that are expected to put out more than 1.5 million vehicles in 2022, compared with one factory when Part Deux was released.
Part Deux also laid out Musk's vision for autonomous driving and ride sharing. Building self-driving cars has been tougher than Musk, and the industry, envisioned.
Part 3 could include more about autonomy. It should also cover Tesla's plans to have more vehicles in more segments of the market. That is critical because Tesla, eventually, will need to build smaller, lower-priced EVs to maintain its growth.
A longer-term outlook for manufacturing could also be part of Plan 3. Tesla's long-run goal is to produce as many as 20 million vehicles annually. That will take many more assembly and battery facilities.
The company didn't respond to a request for comment on Friday.
Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote Thursday evening that Plan 3 could include a new focus on battery supply and innovation . He even suggested in his report that Plan 3 could include more collaboration between Musk's other companies: SpaceX and the Boring Company, which builds tunnels under cities.
That looks like a good call. Musk tweeted again early Monday indicating the new Plan would include sections about the other two company's he controls.
Plans for Tesla's robot, named Optimus , might also make into Plan 3.
Master Plan 3 might be closer to what investors hoped for when Musk said he would update investors about Tesla's product plan during the f ourth-quarter earnings conference call in January. Back then, he said Tesla wasn't working on a $25,000 EV and that the No. 1 priority for the year was scaling up production.
The update disappointed investors. Shares fell 11.6% following the talk, but the prospect of more news seems to be lifting the stock.
Tesla shares were up 2.6% in Friday trading, while the S&P 500 was flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.3%. Friday's move adds to a 3.9% gain on Thursday, taking the stock to the brink of $900, up about 13% for the week.
Monday morning, Tesla stock was up another 1.5%. Dow and S&P futures were down about 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively.

40,23-Mar-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Tesla Opens Its First European Plant: [Business/Financial Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2641721157/BFD812D457A14912PQ/494?accountid=13946,"The $7 billion plant will eventually produce half a million S.U.V.s a year, the company said.BERLIN -- Tesla officially began making cars in Europe on Tuesday, opening an assembly plant in a critical market where Elon Musk, the chief executive, plans to build 500,000 electric vehicles a year.Mr. Musk escorted Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany and other officials on a tour of the huge, low-slung $7 billion plant just outside Berlin. It was constructed in a little more than two years, a speed that amazed German officials and commentators.""Electromobility will shape the mobility of the future,"" Mr. Scholz said after the tour.Robert Habeck, the German vice chancellor and the country's economy minister, said it was ""a special day for the region, a special day also for Germany and a special day for the mobility transformation in Germany.""Mr. Musk wrote on Twitter: ""Danke Deutschland!!""He celebrated the day by handing over the first 30 European-built Teslas to customers who had ordered them and been invited to the event. Tesla will build its Model Y sport utility vehicle at the plant.The plan for the factory, called Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, was first revealed in a surprise announcement by Mr. Musk a little over two years ago, and it overcame a number of legal and political challenges to attain its production certification.Tesla raced to build the factory, and was allowed to proceed after securing only preliminary approvals from government authorities -- on the condition that Mr. Musk agreed to tear down the plant and leave the site as he found it if state boards ultimately refused the project. It was a gamble that the carmaker won this month when the authorities approved the production site.A battery production plant on the property still requires state approval before going live.The speed with which Tesla built the factory in a country known for its rigid bureaucracy and deliberate planning was a theme during the opening speeches. Just a few miles away sits Berlin's new airport, which opened two years ago after nearly a decade of delays.Mr. Habeck started using the phrase ""Tesla speed"" some weeks ago, and Mr. Scholz said the short construction time would promote Germany as a place to invest.""Germany can be quick,"" he said in his speech.The project also represents a significant financial investment in the former East German states that since reunification have attracted less major business than the traditional powerhouse states of the former West Germany. Jörg Steinbach, the Brandenburg state economics minister, who helped lure Tesla to the region, said: ""All of the sudden we're known. All of the sudden people are making enquiries.""The 2.4 million-square-foot plant places Tesla in one of the most important electric car markets in the world. European countries have passed laws to phase out internal combustion engines.And electric cars are increasingly joining the mainstream. More than 20 percent of new cars sold in Europe and Britain in December were powered solely by electricity, data from government agencies showed. Europeans also bought more electric cars than diesels in December; diesels were once the most popular engine option in Europe.The German site is Tesla's third major plant, after factories in Fremont, Calif., and Shanghai. Another plant, outside Austin, Texas, is expected to open soon. The new plants are expected to double the company's production capacity to about two million vehicles a year, according to analysts at Wedbush Securities.Once it is fully operational, the German plant will employ 12,000 people. Some 3,000 employees already work there, according to Tesla.Built just 130 miles east of Volkswagen's headquarters in Wolfsburg, on an old East German Army training site, the plant was also a direct challenge to German carmakers that had been trying to make E.V. inroads.Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive Management in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, said that while Tesla was a ""thorn in the flesh of German automakers,"" its presence in the country could ultimately help lift the entire sector.""On the one hand, this is the strongest competitor sitting right on the doorstep, but it can also have a motivating and stimulating effect,"" he said.While state and federal governments supported the construction, a number of environmental and civic groups have criticized the factory, especially for its projected water use. Protesters on Tuesday walked around the Tesla site with handwritten signs criticizing Mr. Musk and Tesla. The police blocked an adjacent autobahn after activists climbed onto a road sign and plastered it with their own message: ""Cars out.""PhotographTesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, inaugurated the plant on Tuesday along with Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany, center left, and Dietmar Woidke, the governor of the state of Brandenburg.

41,23-Mar-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition","Tesla's First European Factory Opens --- The plant in Germany aims to make up to 500,000 vehicles a year eventually",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2641736908/BFD812D457A14912PQ/734?accountid=13946,"BERLIN -- Elon Musk formally kicked off customer deliveries at Tesla Inc.'s first European factory outside Berlin, marking a milestone in the electric-car maker's international expansion.
Speaking Tuesday as he handed the first Tesla Model Y vehicles built at the plant to their new owners, the chief executive said the factory would create a foundation for both electric vehicles and the batteries that would store energy from wind and the sun. Mr. Musk called that a big step in the fight against global warming.
""Every vehicle that we make will be another step in the direction of a sustainable energy future,"" he said. ""You should have hope in the future. This problem will be solved.""
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz welcomed the plant as an economic boost for eastern Germany, which is still catching up with the country's wealthier west more than three decades after reunification.
Tesla shares rose 7.9% Tuesday to $993.98.
Two years in the making, the factory will allow Tesla to build cars for European markets, which currently rely on expensive imports from the U.S. and China, and to tailor vehicles to local tastes, analysts said. The plant aims to eventually employ up to 12,000 people and make up to 500,000 vehicles a year, starting with the Model Y, a sporty crossover.
On the eve of the plant's opening, Mr. Musk tweeted: ""Makes a huge difference to capital efficiency to localize production within a continent.""
In 2019, the state of Brandenburg competed with other locations in Germany and Europe to host the Tesla plant. Its proposed location, in Grunheide, a town surrounded by forests and lakes, won the bid thanks to its proximity to the German capital and the regional government's pledge to achieve quick approvals for the plant. As part of the contest, German officials even hosted flights for Tesla executives in an Antonov plane called ""Anushka"" to survey the land where the factory was to be built.
At the time, Mr. Musk was in Berlin to accept the ""Golden Steering Wheel"" award from a German automotive industry group. He unveiled the news and said, ""Everyone knows German engineering is outstanding for sure. You know that is part of the reason why we are locating Gigafactory Europe in Germany.""
The wait to start producing in Europe is over, butTesla's drive into the region could be slowed by Russia's war on Ukraine, which has caused new shortages for car makers in the region. While Tesla has better managed the chip crisis than most of its rivals, it uses many of the same suppliers as German manufacturers.
""Tesla cannot fundamentally detach itself from the delivery bottlenecks,"" said Stefan Bratzel, director of the Center of Automotive Management, a research institute in Germany.
Ferdinand Dudenhoffer, director of the CAR Center Automotive Research in Duisburg, Germany, said the new plant in Europe would likely help Tesla become even more competitive against German rivals such as BMW as it continues to lower costs.
""We assume that Grunheide will produce at least 100,000 new Tesla models this year, and in 2023 the curve will rise sharply,"" he said.
Tesla has faced opposition to the Grunheide factory from environmental groups concerned about the amount of water the plant would require, and activists staged a protest on the sidelines of Tuesday's opening. Still, Germany has generally welcomed Tesla as a sign that the country, which has high labor costs and strong unions, has remained an attractive place to invest.
Robert Habeck, Germany's economic minister and a leader of the environmentalist Greens, praised Tesla's ""audacious corporate culture"" for taking the risk to start building the factory before official approval had been completed. If final approval hadn't been granted, the company would have had to take down the buildings and return the land to its original state.

42,25-Mar-22,Barron's (Online),The SEC Responds in Its Battle With Tesla CEO Elon Musk. It's Not Conceding.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2642694992/BFD812D457A14912PQ/724?accountid=13946,"The battle between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission doesn't look as if it's about to end.
This week, the SEC responded to an early March court filing by Musk . The agency doesn't appear to be giving any ground.
Musk's filing seeks to ""quash"" and terminate a consent decree relating to a 2018 settlement with the SEC, which resolved an SEC charge that Musk committed securities fraud when he tweeted in August 2018 that he had secured funding to take Tesla (ticker: TSLA) private at $420 a share. That was equivalent to $84 a share, following a subsequent stock split.
Musk's filing earlier this month might have been precipitated by an SEC subpoena dated Nov. 29, 2021, that asked him to produce documents related to board oversight of his Twitter usage. Musk's filing accused the SEC of acting ""in bad faith as part of a concerted campaign to target and silence Mr. Musk's speech on matters of public concern.""
The SEC response, reviewed by Barron's, runs to about 23 pages and states that ""Musk's motion to quash is procedurally defective and substantively meritless."" It also defended the issuing of the November subpoena, adding, ""there is no valid substantive basis to challenge the subpoena.""
In particular, the subpoena was looking into whether Musk got approval for his tweet about selling 10% of his Tesla stock . That tweet was part of a Twitter poll. Musk was weighing into the debate on billionaire taxation. His Twitter followers voted he should sell the stake, and Musk sold billions in stock at the end of the year. He sold stock he held outright and sold stock after exercising expiring stock options .
The SEC declined to comment on the court filing. Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.
For investors, the issue has yet to be a big deal. But they still better pay attention to the distraction.
From the time Musk's filing came to light to Thursday's close of trading, Tesla stock has risen about 23%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average have gained up about 8% and 6%, respectively, over the same span.
Back in 2018, at the time of the initial tweet controversy, Tesla's market capitalization was roughly $50 billion to $60 billion. Now it's more than $1 trillion. Investors weren't wrong for ignoring the drama back then.
What's more, the initial settlement cost the company $20 million. It cost Musk $20 million as well. Those amounts just don't seem to be enough to move the needle for Tesla investors.
Still, the drama bears watching.

43,25-Mar-22,Washington Examiner,Elon Musk sets off speculation with informal Twitter poll,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2643174487/BFD812D457A14912PQ/754?accountid=13946,"Tesla founder Elon Musk set off a torrent of speculation after he posted a poll about Twitter and freedom of speech, which he said would be consequential.
Musk, the world's wealthiest person, asked his 79 million Twitter followers whether they think the social media giant is facilitating free speech. As of Friday afternoon, about 1.2 million people had responded to the informal survey with a vast majority, nearly 70%, pushing back on the notion. 
""Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?"" Musk asked. ""The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully.""
Speculation quickly began to grow that Musk might be plotting to start his own rival social media network because of the questions surrounding Twitter and freedom of speech.
MUSK ACCUSES THE SEC OF HARASSING TESLA TO CHILL HIS CRITICISM OF GOVERNMENT
The Twitter poll came a day after the billionaire posted another informal survey asking his followers whether Twitter's algorithm should be open source. More than 82% of respondents agreed that it should, and former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey even jumped into the conversation.
""The choice of which algorithm to use (or not) should be open to everyone,"" said Dorsey, who announced his resignation in November. 
The polls come as Musk's past tweets have been in the news. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked a federal judge this week to hold Musk to an agreement from a 2018 consent decree that mandated that Tesla lawyers need to approve tweets and other social media posts that could affect Tesla.
The tweet in question that led to the settlement with the SEC was when Musk said that he was considering taking Tesla private after its share price reached $420, adding, ""Funding secured."" The SEC sued Musk in response.
The SEC has additionally issued a subpoena, which Musk is working to quash, in response to another Twitter poll from November in which the billionaire asked his followers whether he should offload a large chunk of his Tesla holdings.
""Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock. Do you support this?"" Musk asked. ""I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes.""
Of the 3.5 million accounts that responded to the poll, 58% said Musk should sell. The poll sent Tesla's stock price dipping by about 16% in the days after the tweet.
Musk has pushed back on the SEC through his lawyer, Alex Spiro. In February, Spiro sent a letter to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan that described a ""pattern of conduct"" by the SEC that ""has gone beyond the pale.""
Spiro also claimed the SEC was using its power to investigate Musk for his vocal criticism of the government. Musk has repeatedly rebuked the Biden administration's proposals and has criticized the government more generally.
""The SEC seems to be targeting Mr. Musk and Tesla for unrelenting investigation largely because Mr. Musk remains an outspoken critic of the government; the SEC's outsized efforts seem calculated to chill his exercise of First Amendment rights rather than to enforce generally applicable laws in evenhanded fashion,"" the letter said.

In January, Musk tweeted that President Joe Biden is ""treating the American public like fools."" While Biden was trying to pass his now-dead ""Build Back Better"" tax and spending plan, Musk attacked the ""trickery"" of the bill and channeled free market economist Milton Friedman.
""Nothing is more permanent than a 'temporary' government program,"" the Tesla founder said, which is an almost exact word-for-word quote from Friedman, who was a preeminent capitalist thinker.

44,28-Mar-22,The Washington Post,How auto regulators played mind games with Elon Musk,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2643851931/BFD812D457A14912PQ/749?accountid=13946,"Getting him to comply required a range of flattery and threats

SAN FRANCISCO - The first time Washington regulators tried to investigate Tesla's Autopilot software, CEO Elon Musk was irate.
Weeks earlier, a Tesla using the company's advanced driver-assistance system had crashed into a tractor-trailer at about 70 mph, killing the driver. When National Highway Traffic Safety Administration officials called Tesla executives to say they were launching an investigation, Musk screamed, protested and threatened to sue, said a former safety official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.
The regulators knew Musk could be impulsive and stubborn; they would need to show some spine to win his cooperation. So they waited. And in a subsequent call, ""when tempers were a little bit cool,"" the official said, Musk agreed to cooperate: ""He was a changed person.""
Since that success in 2016, officials have learned to work with Musk, using a combination of pressure, flattery and threats to persuade him to comply with federal safety measures, according to a half-dozen former regulators, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. In the past six months, Tesla has issued at least a dozen voluntary recalls, a dramatic turnaround for a company known to quietly issue software updates direct to cars - without alerting the public - to fix sometimes alarming safety problems.
With about 2 million cars on the road, Tesla recently has experienced a wave of troubles: Cars using its driver-assistance features have slammed on the brakes for no reason and rolled through stop signs - the latter because Tesla programmed them to do so. A string of crashes into parked emergency vehicles is under investigation. And the cars' batteries have been documented exploding in crashes and while parked in garages.
Such issues typically prompt NHTSA to investigate and sometimes to push for voluntary or mandatory recalls.
 If an automaker refuses to cooperate, NHTSA can impose cash fines of about $23,000 per day. The threat of fines - which can add up to nearly $115 million - generally works with traditional companies, the former officials said, but hasn't proven effective when dealing with Tesla, an extraordinarily valuable company owned by the richest man in the world.
So NHTSA officials have turned to less conventional strategies to force the electric vehicle manufacturer to be more transparent about safety issues - a critical matter at a time when more than 50,000 drivers can now use Tesla's ""Full Self-Driving"" software to navigate the nation's public roads.
""Tesla is presumably smart enough to realize when they don't have the upper hand anymore,"" said Phil Koopman, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University whose focus includes federal auto regulations. ""Tesla has a choice to make - they have to decide whether to cave or go to the mat. And the reality is, on [federal safety regulations] they're going to lose.""
Tesla and Musk did not respond to specific questions in a detailed request for comment. Musk said in an email, ""For the 100th time, please give my regards to your puppetmaster,"" referring to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post. In a subsequent email, he also criticized The Post's paywall for online articles.
NHTSA declined to make anyone available for an interview, citing ongoing investigations. But the agency issued written statements to The Post expressing its commitment to protect public safety.
Tesla has publicly touted the safety of its vehicles and its driver-assistance technology, boasting that it has won the highest possible score - five stars - in crash tests where NHTSA slams cars into barriers and then examines the results. Tesla also has said its cars have the lowest probability of injury of any car tested, though NHTSA has disputed that characterization.
Musk's own attitude was part of the problem with efforts to enforce safety, the officials said. Some experienced personal encounters with Musk that escalated into yelling matches or otherwise proved unproductive because of the CEO's skepticism about their findings.
NHTSA's experiences with Tesla were unique among major automakers, the officials said. It was not rare for companies under scrutiny to fiercely push back against their findings, sometimes resulting in mandatory rather than voluntary recalls, they said. But with Tesla, issues as simple as a malfunctioning heat pump or noncompliant sound effects to alert pedestrians to a vehicles' presence could result in stubbornness.
Tesla eventually issued recalls in both cases - decisions influenced by NHTSA, a spokeswoman said.
""NHTSA will ensure that vehicle manufacturers and developers prioritize safety while they usher in the latest technologies,"" spokeswoman Lucia Sanchez said.
Regulators have been slow to take action on some software suites that power automated features, in part because they are wary of appearing to stifle emerging technologies, the former officials said. There also are few rules governing these technologies, further hindering efforts at regulation.
Since 2016, NHTSA has opened 31 special crash investigation cases involving advanced driver-assistance technology, according to data provided by the agency. Twenty-four have involved Tesla vehicles.
Safety experts and some of the former regulators who spoke with The Post raised concerns about ""Full Self-Driving"" in particular because of its experimental nature. Tesla says the software is in ""beta,"" meaning it is a pilot through which the company hopes to learn and improve its features for an eventual full release.
Lawmakers have pressed for more transparency regarding Tesla's practices. In February, following a Post report on the cars' sudden braking, Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) criticized Tesla for putting software on the roads ""without fully considering its risks and implications."" They urged NHTSA ""to continue taking all appropriate action to protect all users of the road."" And they called on the Federal Trade Commission to launch an investigation into what they called ""misleading advertising and marketing"" of Autopilot and ""Full Self-Driving"" systems.
During much of the Obama administration, Tesla slid under the radar of federal safety regulators. As a niche automaker delivering at most tens of thousands of luxury cars per year, officials said it would not have ranked on the agency's priority list, compared with high-volume automakers such as Ford and Toyota. 
From 2013 to 2015, there was just one recall per year for early Tesla Model S luxury sedans. Those recalls - which involved seat back mountings, charging equipment and incorrectly secured seat belts - compare with a total of 2,261 vehicle recalls over the same period, according to NHTSA data.
One early run-in set the tone for regulators' interactions with Tesla. In 2013, Tesla claimed its Model S was the safest car ever tested by NHTSA.
Officials at the agency were dumbstruck, according to some of those who spoke with The Post. The agency issues up to 5-star ratings, but it does not take its designations beyond the star score.
At one point, two former officials recalled, NHTSA officials threatened to contact the FTC, which regulates marketing. ""If Tesla wasn't willing to pull the plug, FTC was probably going to take action,"" one of the former officials said.
Tesla backed down.
But Tesla continued to make similar claims, including in 2019, when it said its Model 3 had the ""lowest probability of injury of any vehicle ever tested"" by NHTSA. The agency ultimately referred the automaker to the FTC. The FTC declined to comment.
NHTSA, meanwhile, focused increasing attention on the automaker as it built more and more cars, launching the Model X SUV in 2015 and steadily growing its production in the buildup to the mass market-aimed Model 3. The agency also had to deal with emerging issues, such as fires caused by road debris striking the cars' underbodies, where the high-voltage battery is located. Musk wrote in a statement at the time that Tesla would introduce a fix to bring that risk ""down to virtually zero.""
One official recalled that regulators were confused by Musk's reluctance to address one battery-related issue. The only evident solution was to appeal to his sense of pride.
""NHTSA staff backs Musk into a corner and challenges his ego and says, 'Wait, you can't solve this?' "" a former official said. ""And the next day he has a solution.""
The Trump administration was even less hands-on. The NHTSA website lists only one recall for the 2017 through 2020 Tesla Model 3, then the automaker's most popular model. Depending on the model year, there were up to eight recalls issued for the same car beginning May 25, 2021, after President Biden took office.
Under the Trump administration, career officials and top staff were reluctant to take a strong stance on a mounting catalogue of safety concerns, wary of appearing to target innovation and already under pressure from the president to ease regulations.
The officials said staffers were reluctant to take on a rapidly emerging automotive power with a massive public platform, worried they wouldn't have the backing of top officials if they received a browbeating from Musk.
""My former staff felt they had nothing to do - twiddling their thumbs,"" one former official said. ""The professional staff - the career staff - wanted to do stuff either from a regulatory standpoint or investigation perspective"" but were stymied.
Musk praised NHTSA as ""great"" in April 2021.
Then, things changed.
Although Labor Secretary Marty Walsh recently met with Musk and took a factory tour in Texas, Axios reported, Musk has criticized President Biden for leaving Tesla out of major events. Musk also has parroted Republican barbs, joking at one point Biden was ""sleeping.""
Last summer, NHTSA began requiring companies such as Tesla to report on certain crashes involving automated features within one day of learning of the incident. Then in August, the agency launched an investigation into about a dozen crashes involving parked emergency vehicles while Autopilot was active. In a letter, it called out Tesla for pushing out a software update to help its cars better see emergency vehicles, without formally issuing a recall.
A surge of investigations, recalls and public admonitions has followed.
Former officials who spoke with The Post said Tesla's haphazard approach has grated on some NHTSA staff, and the enforcement reflects an attempt at a course correction.
""The agency does hold a very firm line on [federal motor vehicle regulations], and I don't think any of us want to live in a world where the automakers do essential recalls without going through that process,"" said Bryan Thomas, who was communications director at NHTSA during the Obama administration. ""If the car's going to react differently at a stop sign tomorrow than it did today, you should know that as a driver.""
The former officials said that NHTSA is not singling out Tesla. Instead, they said the agency is using a calculated approach to try to force the combative automaker to recognize findings that can't be denied. That means picking targets - the seat belt chime, rolling stops, a windshield defroster - that may strike executives and even some owners as trivial. But those narrow targets offer an entree to larger issues that are not yet addressed by federal regulations, which often lag behind the latest software advances.
In February, NHTSA cracked down on a feature known as ""Boombox,"" which plays sounds that bystanders can hear - such as an ice cream truck jingle - but can drown out sounds that warn pedestrians of approaching vehicles. On Twitter, Musk decried the agency as the ""fun police.""
Federal safety investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board have also focused their attention on Tesla. Late last year, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy wrote a letter to Musk calling out the company's ""inaction"" on recommendations that would have added safeguards to the Autopilot system in response to the fatal 2016 crash with the tractor-trailer.
In a statement posted to its website at the time, Tesla called the death ""A Tragic Loss."" The company defended the performance of Autopilot across the tens of millions of miles it had logged and emphasized that drivers should be prepared to take control of the vehicle at any time.
In September, Homendy expressed her concern about Musk's approach to safety in an interview with The Post.
""I think Elon Musk is an incredible innovator,"" she said, expressing hope for ""the ultimate success of [autonomous vehicle] technologies - which could save lives.""
But she also encouraged Musk to ""really prioritize safety for his company,"" adding: ""I don't want to see lives lost in the meantime.""

45,29-Mar-22,The New York Observer,Tesla’s Stock Split is More Flash Than Substance,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2644588583/BFD812D457A14912PQ/735?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk attends the official opening of the new Tesla electric car manufacturing plant on March 22, 2022 near Gruenheide, Germany. Christian Marquardt - Pool/Getty Images
Tesla stock jumped 8 percent March 28 after the Elon Musk-run electric carmaker said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing it’s planning to split its stock—the second time in less than two years.
A stock split divides a company’s shares into more shares, which in turn increases the number of shares available and lowers a stock’s per-share price. The event doesn’t change a company’s market cap or any of its business fundamentals. But the conventional wisdom goes that stock splits make a company’s stock rise, because they make a stock more accessible to average investors.
This was true in traditional securities trading, when stocks are traded in minimum “round lots” of 100 shares. So, when a $1,000 share is split into ten $100 shares, it makes a round lot of the stock 10 times cheaper and therefore accessible to a larger pool of retail investors.
But the logic no longer holds in modern markets, where trading apps like Robinhood not only don’t have the minimum round lot rule but also allow investors to buy fractional shares—as little as 1/1000000 of a share—with no commission. So theoretically, a stock split shouldn’t automatically create more demand.
Nevertheless, the sentiment remains. Last time Tesla announced a stock split (5-to-1), in August 2020, shares shot up 80 percent over the three weeks from just before the split announcement to the time the split took effect.
“We simply cannot fundamentally explain how a stock split can add nearly 1.5 times the market cap of General Motors or one full Volkswagen’s worth of market cap to Tesla almost instantly,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to clients on March 29, Bloomberg reported."
46,1-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk's Tesla Trounced All the Trillion-Dollar Stocks. Berkshire Hathaway Did Even Better.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2645887737/BFD812D457A14912PQ/47?accountid=13946,"What do Elon Musk and Warren Buffett have in common? Shares of both of their megacapitalization companies posted gains for the first quarter of 2022.
Investors probably aren't surprised that Berkshire Hathaway (ticker: BRK/B) stock was up. It is a value stock, a category that outperformed growth shares in the quarter. That is what makes the strength of Tesla (TSLA), a growth stock, a big surprise.
Equally unexpected, considering traditional investing tenets, is that the shares outperformed all the other trillion-dollar stocks in the S&P 500. Tesla stock ended the quarter with a gain of about 2%. It isn't much, but investors are unlikely to have been upset considering the comparable numbers.
The Russell 1000 Growth Index, and the Nasdaq Composite Index, both dropped about 9% in the quarter. The S&P 500 dropped 5%.
The Russell 1000 Value Index did better than most, dropping only 1% in the quarter. Berkshire stock, which isn't in the trillion-dollar club, with a market capitalization of a bit less than $800 billion, gained about 18% in the quarter.
None of the other trillion-dollar companies posted first-quarter gains. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) dropped about 4% and 2%, respectively. Microsoft (MSFT) fell about 8%. Apple (AAPL) dropped 2%.
Tesla isn't supposed to outperform in a down market. Tesla is supposed to be a risker, more volatile stock that the others, so it should get hurt worse in market downdrafts.
Tesla's so-called equity beta, a measure used to assess the riskiness of a stock, is roughly two. That essentially means the stock is twice as volatile as the overall market, making it risker by definition.
The beta for the other trillion-dollar stocks is about one. That means, roughly speaking, if the S&P 500 goes up 1%, investors should expect Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Apple stock to go up by roughly the same percentage.
In the first quarter, the riskier stock won. Tesla might have beaten its trillion-dollar peers because the news it delivered was more surprising. Back in early January, Tesla reported delivering about 309,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter. That was far better than the roughly 275,000 Wall Street had projected.
Still, the ride for investors was a rough one. Tesla shares hit an intraquarter low of $700 on Feb. 24, putting it down about 34% for the year to date, only to rally more than 50% from there into the end of March. The intraquarter losses in the other four stocks averaged about 17%. None was worse than Tesla's—indicating that beta worked as an indicator of intraquarter volatility.
A higher beta means, theoretically speaking, that investors should demand more return for Tesla stock than other large stocks. Investors should get more return for taking more risk.
Of course, it doesn't always turn out that way in practice. Academic papers have long demonstrated a "" beta anomaly ""—the fact that for a long time, low-beta stocks have outperformed high-beta stocks. That just isn't what's supposed to happen, so academics have tried to find tools other than simple beta to measure individual stocks' riskiness.
What happens to the trillion-dollar companies matters even for people trying to track the broader market with index funds. Tesla and its four trillion-dollar counterparts represent about 25% of the entire market capitalization of the S&P 500. They accounted for about 17% of the $2 trillion in market capitalization the index lost in the first quarter.

47,4-Apr-22,Boston Globe (Online),Musk becomes Twitter's largest shareholder,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2646761282/BFD812D457A14912PQ/335?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and the world's wealthiest person, bought a nearly 10 percent stake in Twitter, the social media platform on which he has more than 80 million followers and shares everything from business ideas and memes to, this past weekend, his experience at a famed Berlin nightclub.The purchase, made public Monday in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, is worth about $2.89 billion based on the closing price of Twitter's stock Friday. News of Musk's buy-in sent Twitter share prices soaring.A spokesperson for Twitter did not immediately respond to messages requesting comment. Musk likewise did not respond to a request for comment.The purchase, equal to 9.2 percent of the company, appears to make Musk Twitter's largest shareholder. His holding is slightly larger than Vanguard's 8.8 percent at the end of last year, and it dwarfs the 2.3 percent stake of Jack Dorsey, Twitter's former CEO. The shares represent a fraction of Musk's reported $270 billion-plus net worth.Musk has criticized the company in recent weeks for failing in his view to adhere to free speech principles, and he has openly considered starting a social network of his own that would be open source. His long and complicated personal relationship with the platform has also gotten him in trouble, with his tweets about Tesla's finances resulting in legal wranglings with the SEC.Some of Musk's ideas, like moving Twitter to an open-source network, have earned the support of Twitter's co-founder, Dorsey, who stepped down as chief executive late last year.“The choice of which algorithm to use (or not) should be open to everyone,” Dorsey said last month in response to a tweet from Musk advocating an open-source algorithm for the platform. Dorsey, who is friendly with Musk, is expected to leave the Twitter board in May.It is unclear what Musk's plans are beyond the large shareholder position and whether he will ask — or be invited — to join Twitter's board. Musk filed a securities document indicating he planned for the investment to be passive, meaning he does not intend to pursue control of the company. But there was also speculation Monday that he could change the status of his investment, continue buying shares or even try to acquire the company outright, The New York Times' DealBook newsletter reported.“We would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter,” Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Monday morning.If Musk pushes for change at Twitter, he would not be the first agitated investor the company has had to contend with in recent years. Activist firm Elliott Management took a position in Twitter and called for Dorsey's removal in 2020. It later struck a deal with Twitter that included a $1 billion investment from private equity firm Silver Lake and brought on new board members, including Silver Lake's co-CEO, Egon Durban. Silver Lake partnered with Musk in his efforts to take Tesla private.Musk's list of other business ventures runs long: Beyond Tesla, he is CEO of rocket company SpaceX and founder of The Boring Co., a tunnel construction services company. Adding another role to the list could irk Tesla shareholders. In the last two months of last year, Musk sold around $16 billion of Tesla stock, equivalent to roughly 10 percent of his stake in the electric vehicle company.Tesla has defied the supply-chain problems that have strained most traditional carmakers, adding to Musk's wealth and his influence in the tech and auto industries. Tesla nearly doubled sales last year, approaching 1 million vehicles sold. On Saturday, Tesla said it sold 310,000 cars in the first three months of 2022, a 70 percent increase from the same period a year earlier — gains that contrast with steep declines reported last week by General Motors and Toyota Motor.Tesla's steadily expanding production network, including new factories in Austin, Texas, and near Berlin, positions the company to rival carmakers like BMW and Mercedes-Benz in numbers of vehicles sold. Despite an array of new battery-powered models from Ford Motor, Kia, and others, Tesla continues to dominate the market for electric cars, the industry's fastest-growing segment.Still, executives who have juggled media projects with other private endeavors have sometimes found themselves in policymakers' crosshairs. Former President Donald Trump took a dim view of Amazon because he disagreed with coverage in The Washington Post, which Jeff Bezos bought in 2013. Tesla is a large beneficiary of environmental credits, while SpaceX pursues government contracts.Regardless of potential pushback, Musk may stand to gain from the investment. The document detailing Musk's stake said it was worth about $3 billion at Friday's closing price. It is dated March 14, and Twitter's shares are up about 50 percent since then."
48,4-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk's Twitter Tantrum Needs a Time Out; Twitter shares soared Monday after Musk's stake disclosure, but they will soon find gravity",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2646752498/BFD812D457A14912PQ/428?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk is paying to change the conversation on Twitter. Investors may pay for his interest.
Twitter's stock surged 27% Monday after Mr. Musk, Tesla's chief executive, disclosed a 9% stake in the company worth about $3 billion, making him the social media platform's largest shareholder.
In previous days, Mr. Musk has taken to Twitter to ask its users whether they believe the platform promotes free speech. In another recent tweet, Mr. Musk expressed his dissatisfaction with Twitter's failure to adhere to free speech principles, suggesting perhaps that a new platform is needed. Twitter says its purpose is to serve the public conversation, but its publicly proclaimed priorities clearly state that while freedom of speech is a fundamental human right, freedom to have that speech amplified by Twitter isn't.
Mr. Musk himself has provided cautionary examples of the real impact freedom of speech on Twitter can have. When he tweeted back in 2018 that he had secured funding to take Tesla private, shares of his company spiked, prompting an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which found Mr. Musk hadn't discussed the specifics of such a deal. In the end, he and his company settled with the SEC, paying millions, and Mr. Musk lost his seat as chairman.
Mr. Musk has now resolved to put his money where his mouth is toward change. What isn't clear is whether that change will make investors any more money. Twitter has been working to revamp its platform amid pressure from activist investor Elliott Management, which has taken issue with the pace at which the platform has been able to boost revenue, among other things.
This won't change any of that . While Mr. Musk has expressed a lot of dissatisfaction with the social media platform, his qualms deal with how the platform manages conversations, rather than how it makes money. In a research note Monday, AB Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik called Mr. Musk's investment in Twitter mere ""retail therapy"" for a billionaire, noting that his interest in the platform seems to be mainly personal and that ""there's no sign that he has particularly commercial intent.""
Indeed, Mr. Musk's interest in Twitter seems to be a little self-centered. In a recent tweet, he called Twitter the ""de facto public town square,"" a description that may be more aspirational than fact. Twitter most recently reported 37 million U.S. monetizable daily active users, or those who can view ads, amounting to just over 10% of the U.S. population. By contrast, Meta Platforms' Facebook app is used daily by 59% of Americans.
If anything changes on Twitter over the coming months as a result of Mr. Musk's investment, it will likely be limited to conversation features. That may well provide a boost to Twitter's user base, as many users seem to share Mr. Musk's gripes at excess controls. Then again, many others are strong advocates of controls on offensive and other content, saying it makes for a better overall user experience.
As GroupM's Brian Wieser wrote Monday, investors naively tend to believe more users—especially those that are highly followed—are always a good thing. He argues most of Twitter's advertisers would prefer more content standards than less, ""even if those standards result in fewer users or less usage."" Indeed, we saw this play out in 2020 when more than 1,000 advertisers boycotted Facebook's platform to protest its handling of hate speech and misinformation, while others more quietly dialed down spending.
The reality is that all social media companies have to strike a difficult balance between user freedom and content management. It is far from clear that having Mr. Musk as a major shareholder will make this task any easier for Twitter. This suggests Twitter's surge on the news on Monday is overdone.
For Twitter investors, Mr. Musk's actions may speak louder than his words. But that alone shouldn't make them actionable.

 Elon Musk's Twitter Tantrum Needs a Time Out

49,4-Apr-22,Republican & Herald,"Stocks close higher, Twitter soars on news of Musk stake",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2646999101/BFD812D457A14912PQ/485?accountid=13946,"Stocks shook off a downbeat start to close higher Monday, as big gains by technology and communications companies helped offset losses elsewhere on Wall Street.
The S&P 500 rose 0.81% after having been down 0.2% in the early going. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.30% and the Nasdaq composite added 1.90%.
Twitter surged 27.1% for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after the company disclosed that Tesla’s Elon Musk had taken a 9.2% stake in the social media platform.
In recent weeks, Musk has publicly questioned the company’s commitment to free speech. The gains were a key factor in lifting the broader communications sector and keeping the S&P 500 in the green even as little less than half the companies in the index fell.
The market’s latest moves follow three straight weekly gains by the S&P 500, even as investors grapple with uncertainties stemming from surging inflation, higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve and the economic fallout from the war in Ukraine.
The S&P 500 rose 36.78 points to 4,582.64, the Dow gained 103.61 points to 34,921.88, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 271.05 points to 14,532.55. Smaller company stocks also gained ground. The Russell 200 index rose 4.33 points, or 0.2%, to 2,095.44.
Apple and other big technology stocks did the heavy lifting Monday, offsetting losses elsewhere.
Tech companies, with their pricey stock values, tend to have more weight in pushing the market up or down. Apple rose 2.4% and Microsoft gained 1.8%.
Retailers and other companies that rely on consumer spending also helped lift the market. Tesla rose 5.6%, Amazon added 2.9% and Home Depot closed 1.2% higher.
Investors continue to monitor the conflict in Ukraine, where Russia could face even stricter economic sanctions now that details are emerging of what appear to be deliberate killings of civilians.
The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, joined a growing chorus of international criticism of the alleged atrocities, saying the 27-country bloc “will advance, as a matter of urgency, work on further sanctions against Russia.”
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has elevated concerns about rising inflation and the impact on global economic growth. Prices for everything from food to clothing had already been rising and the war has made for even more volatile energy prices.
The price of U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 4% and Brent crude, the international standard rose 3%. Prices are up roughly 40% globally, which has put pressure on costs for gasoline and other goods.
Bond yields mostly gained ground. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.41% from 2.38% late Friday. The yield on the two-year Treasury dipped to 2.41% after having moved higher most earlier in the day.
The two-year yield has been hovering at times above the 10-year yield, which is a potentially ominous sign. Such a flip of the usual relationship between two- and 10-year yields has preceded many recessions in the past, though it hasn’t been a perfect predictor. Some market watchers caution the signal may be less accurate this time, because of distortions in yields caused by extraordinary measures by the Federal Reserve and other central banks to keep interest rates low.
Bond yields have been climbing all year as Wall Street prepares higher interest rates. The Federal Reserve has already raised its key overnight rate once, the first such increase since 2018. The central bank is expected to continue raising rates throughout 2022 to help counter the impact from rising inflation.
The Fed is due to release minutes from its last meeting on Wednesday.
Markets in Europe closed higher. Asian markets also rose and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng jumped 2.1% after regulators in Beijing said they plan to revise rules regarding access of overseas regulators to full audits of companies that have shares listed in overseas markets."

India's Gautam Adani has reached a net worth of $100 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He and nine other people, including Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, currently have a net worth of at least $100 billion.
While establishing the exact net worth of the world's wealthiest can be tricky, in part because many of their holdings are private, these rankings have often been a source of bragging rights among the world's richest , including Mr. Musk and Mr. Bezos who have sparred at one another over their respective wealth.
Mr. Adani is founder and chairman of the Adani Group, a sprawling conglomerate with businesses in sectors such as energy, mining, real estate and agriculture.
Rising stock markets, particularly in India, over the past 12 months have helped drive Mr. Adani's net worth sharply higher.
Adani Group is composed of seven publicly listed entities with a combined market capitalization of about $188 billion, according to the conglomerate . One of the publicly traded companies, Adani Enterprises Ltd., has risen more than 80% over the past 12 months.
Mr. Adani's net worth topped $100 billion on Monday, up from $57 billion a year ago.
Mr. Adani joins the likes of Tesla Inc.'s Mr. Musk, Amazon.com Inc.'s Mr. Bezos and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE's Bernard Arnault, who are the world's three richest people respectively, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index .
Mr. Musk tops the list with a net worth of $273 billion. Mr. Bezos is second at $188 billion. Frenchman Mr. Arnault and Mr. Adani and are the only non-Americans in the ranking's top 10, all of whom are men.
The Bloomberg Billionaires Index measures personal wealth based on changes in markets, the economy and other reporting. Figures are updated every business day.
The top 10 have a combined net worth of $1.42 trillion.
Mr. Adani pushed India's Mukesh Ambani—chairman of Reliance Industries Ltd., which engages in the energy and telecommunications sectors—off the ranking's top 10 list. His net worth is $99 billion.

51,4-Apr-22,Washington Examiner,Musk has likely already made more than $1 billion on Twitter investment,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2647363354/BFD812D457A14912PQ/643?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has already gained more than $1 billion on his Twitter purchase, the same day it was revealed. 
Musk, the cheeky Tesla founder and the world's wealthiest person, purchased a 9.2% stake in the company in March, according to a filing released on Monday dated March 14. If Musk had purchased all of his more than 73 million shares on that date, their value would have ballooned by more than $1.2 billion at close on Monday — a whopping 51.3% return.
The form Musk used to disclose the massive holdings, Schedule 13G, does not list the purchase price of the shares or whether they were all bought on the same day. It does list the number of shares that were scooped up, and the form itself indicates he isn't planning to engage in activism or try to force his way on to Twitter's board — although that could presumably change in the future.
BANKS BRACE FOR CFPB TO TAKE AIM AT CREDIT CARD LATE FEES
News about Musk's enormous Twitter stock purchase dominated the financial markets on Monday.
Twitter's stock price, which was resting at $33.03 on March 14, increased by 27.12% on Monday in response, with a single share now worth nearly $50.
Analysts are wondering what Musk's intentions are with the purchase, a mere fraction of his reported $287 billion wealth, but it might relate to qualms he has with the social media platform and free speech.
Last month Musk quizzed his 79 million Twitter followers about whether they think the social media giant is correctly allowing the flow of free speech. A vast majority said they didn't think Twitter rigorously adheres to the notion that free speech is essential to a functioning democracy.
""Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy. What should be done?"" said Musk, who by this point had already filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, setting off speculation the billionaire could be plotting his own Twitter-like social media network.

Last month Musk also posted a Twitter poll asking his followers whether the company's algorithm should be open-source. More than 82% of respondents agreed that it should, and Twitter founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey even joined in the conversation, saying the ""choice of which algorithm to use (or not) should be open to everyone.""
Dorsey holds a 2.25% stake in the company's shares while the second-largest shareholder after Musk is the Vanguard Group, which owns an 8.39% stake.

Tesla (ticker: TSLA) investors have been asking that question about their company's iconoclast CEO Elon Musk for a long time. It has taken on greater urgency after Twitter added Musk to its board of directors one day after he disclosed a big stake in the social media platform.
Musk has always had a lot on his plate. He runs Tesla, which has a huge lead in the electric-vehicle market but is facing competition from traditional auto makers and upstarts. He's also in charge of SpaceX, which provides rockets for NASA and private enterprises, while also building a satellite internet service called Starlink. He also runs brain-implant company Neuralink, and a tunneling firm dubbed the Boring Company. Now Twitter is being added to Musk's busy schedule.
For now, the market doesn't seem all that concerned. Tesla (ticker: TSLA) is up about 2% since Musk's stake was disclosed Monday. Shares are reacting to solid first-quarter delivery figures , reported Saturday; investors seem to have ignored the Twitter news.
Twitter stock is reacting favorably to Musk's involvement. Shares have gained 31% this week, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are both flat over the same span.
The lack of a reaction in Tesla stock doesn't mean Tesla investors are thrilled with Musk's decision to join Twitter's board. ""Not sure what to make of Elon's nearly 10% stake,"" says Gary Black , portfolio manager of the Future Fund Active ETF (FFND), which counts Tesla as its largest position. ""Worst case, he gets distracted by [Twitter] and loses focus.""
Gerber Kawasaki CEO Ross Gerber isn't as concerned. ""I think he'll be fine,"" Gerber tells Barron's. . Boards ""don't take much time and he'll be good for Twitter.""
New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu seems to line up with Gerber. Ferragu argues that one of Musk's biggest strengths is to ""empower the talents he has at Tesla."" That includes engineering head Andrew Baglino and CFO Zachary Kirkhorn, the two executives directly under Musk, who regularly participate in investor events and conference calls.
Musk also ceded the board chairpersonship to Robyn Denholm back in 2018 as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over Musk's Twitter habits. It might have been a difficult backdrop for the start of a working relationship, but Musk has praised Denholm's contributions to the company since she took on the role.
In fact, Ferragu views Musk as fundamentally a problem solver. Tesla exists to put the planet on a path to a sustainable energy future. His space company SpaceX exists to ensure humanity survives far into the future by becoming a multi-planetary species. Taking a role in a struggling Twitter aligns with that ethos.
With Twitter, Musk sees a problem with content moderation and free speech. ""Musk's criticism of the Twitter platform on free speech grounds is well documented,"" wrote Truist analyst Youssef Squali in a Tuesday report. ""We believe a primary driver of this investment is Mr. Musk's desire to reshape the platform and make it more open-source with fewer intermediary controls.""
Squali doesn't cover Tesla shares. He covers Twitter.
Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas , who covers Tesla, sees some benefit for Musk's Twitter involvement, as it relates to his EV company. He believes Musk's ability to create broad public support for his vision is important to Tesla's success. Twitter has helped Musk to do that.
""Platforms like Twitter may have an increasing strategic relevance to Tesla over time,"" said Jonas in a Tuesday report.
For Tesla, whether the pros outweigh the cons remains to be seen.

""Do you want an edit button?"" he asked his followers late Monday, driving the point home by misspelling ""yes"" in one of the answer buttons. Earlier in the day, Musk, the chief executive of Tesla (ticker: TSLA), purchased a 9.2% passive stake in the social-media company , driving the stock up more than 27%.
Parag Agrawal, chief executive of Twitter (TWTR), followed up Musk's tweet by saying that people should vote carefully, though others added that Twitter has for a while been working on a way for users to edit their postings.
The point isn't really that Musk, a prolific user of the service long before he was an owner, will always get what he wants. He might not, at least sometimes, be able to bend everything around him to his will. But the intervention makes it very clear that he's certainly going to tinker with his new toy.
That's Cathie Wood's takeaway. The CEO of Ark Investment Management, which is a large shareholder of Tesla, told Bloomberg Radio that Musk's investment in Twitter could be laying the groundwork for a management shakeup at the company. Agrawal only took over from Twitter founder Jack Dorsey a few months ago. This could be a ""strong signal"" to the new CEO, she said.
Neil Wilson at Markets.com had a similar take on Musk's tweet about the edit button. ""No way is this passive,"" he wrote in a note Tuesday.
Twitter shares were rising 2.8% to $51.38 in premarket trading Tuesday.

The billionaire entrepreneur's leadership positions are mostly for companies that he either runs or has a significant stake in. He is chief executive and a board member of electric-car maker Tesla Inc., which has a roughly $1.1 trillion market value. He leads rocket company Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX as it is known, as chairman and CEO.
Mr. Musk is also running the Boring Co., which constructs transportation tunnels, and Neuralink Corp., a developer of brain-computer interfaces.
He is a board member for media and entertainment company Endeavor Group Holdings Inc., a stint which ends in June.
And now, he is Twitter's largest shareholder .
On Tuesday, Mr. Musk tweeted that he was looking forward to working with Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and the board ""to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months!""
Here are some of the board positions that Mr. Musk has held over the years:
Tesla, 2004-present
Mr. Musk was an early investor in Tesla and joined the board of directors in 2004. He stepped down as chairman in 2018 but remained on the board as a member after he reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations that he misled investors with Twitter messages claiming that he intended to take Tesla private. Mr. Musk didn't admit or deny any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. He and Tesla each agreed to pay a fine of $20 million. Mr. Musk has been seeking to terminate that settlement. 
SpaceX, 2002-present
Mr. Musk has served as chief executive and chairman of the board with SpaceX since he founded the company in 2002. The rocket company has been working to develop viable businesses around human space flights. The company has also been developing internet satellites .
Endeavor Group, 2021-2022
The media and entertainment company tapped Mr. Musk to join its board in 2021 , citing his experience running a public company and service on other boards, according to SEC filings. That relationship didn't last long. The company said last month Mr. Musk planned to step down from the board in June, according to SEC filings. Endeavor didn't cite why Mr. Musk was moving on but said his resignation wasn't due to any disagreements with the company, according to the filing.
OpenAI, 2015-2018
Mr. Musk co-founded OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research and deployment company that began as a nonprofit organization, in 2015 and served as a board member. He left the board in 2018, and the organization said his departure would eliminate a potential future conflict for Mr. Musk as Tesla focused more on developing artificial intelligence products.
SolarCity Corp., 2006-2016
Mr. Musk was an early investor in the solar panel-energy company, which was founded by his cousins Lyndon Rive and Peter Rive. He was chairman of the board of directors for SolarCity until Tesla acquired the company in 2016.

Musk posted a poll to his Twitter account Monday night asking whether users wanted an edit button, including a cheeky reference to the benefits of the feature by offering responses of ""yse"" or ""on,"" just one day after a financial filing revealed that Musk had purchased a 9.2% stake in Twitter's future. Even Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal alluded to the power the poll's results could have. 
""The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully,"" Agrawal wrote in a quote-tweet of Musk's poll, echoing the phrasing of Musk's March 25 poll that sparked interest in whether Musk was investing in social media.
The majority of respondents voted ""yse"" as of Tuesday morning. The poll is set to close at approximately 8 p.m.
MUSK HAS LIKELY ALREADY MADE MORE THAN $1 BILLION ON TWITTER INVESTMENT
Musk, the world's richest man, now owns 73,486,938 shares in Twitter, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing published on Monday.
Musk declared himself a passive stakeholder in Twitter's stock in the filing, which means he does not intend to participate in the Big Tech company's policymaking directly. 
But Musk maintained the poll could still be useful in reflecting Twitter users' preferences.
""If the people vote overwhelmingly for something, it is at least *a* data point!"" Musk wrote in a follow-up tweet.

Twitter users have wanted an edit button for several years, and the company teased a rollout of the feature on April 1, though many users speculated that tweet was a joke in celebration of April Fools' Day.
Musk has already made an estimated $1 billion on his Twitter purchase based on the increase in stock value after the SEC released its filing on Monday.

The ultimate aim of Musk's 73.5-million-share purchase, worth $3 billion based on the closing price Friday, remains unclear. But tweets that he posted just days after buying the stake indicate that Twitter's status as an arena for debate may have weighed heavily on his decision to buy in.
""Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free-speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy,"" Musk, the richest man in the world and an active Twitter user with 80 million followers, posted March 26. Regulatory filings indicate that Musk bought his shares March 14.

""What should be done?"" he added, before continuing in a follow-up tweet: ""Is a new platform needed?""
The latter question is one that has cropped up over and over again in the last few years as social media have taken on an ever-larger role in America's public discourse and, accordingly, prompted debate as to if and when platforms should delete, hide or fact-check users' posts.
Such arguments have plagued the internet for decades, but rose to national prominence in 2016 and 2020 amid concerns about electoral misinformation; during the COVID-19 pandemic as medical misinformation went viral; and in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol as people debated what risk social media pose to public safety.
Indeed, it was in the aftermath of the insurrection that Twitter, Facebook and other platforms took unprecedented steps in moving to ban former President Trump from their sites for his role in the day's events. With the notoriously social media-savvy ""tweeter-in-chief"" cut off from his favorite soapboxes, a host of fledgling social networks saw a chance to scoop up one of the biggest posters on the planet -- or at least get some of his followers to join.
Those ambitions largely failed to materialize, however. Instead of joining a preexisting app such as Parler or Gab, both of which have sought to build a brand around free-speech absolutism, Trump hinted that he might make his own platform from scratch.
Yet those efforts, too, largely failed to catch on. Trump's homegrown app Truth Social was waylaid from the start by technical complications and has since seen its user base stagnate; Trump posted on the platform only once. A personal blog Trump launched similarly failed to recapture the dynamism of his Twitter brand.
Gettr, another free-speech-focused app launched by former Trump advisor Jason Miller, can't even get Trump to join.
If Musk's recent tweets are any indication, the billionaire tech magnate is pursuing a similar goal but from the opposite direction. Rather than trying to port his brand onto a more niche platform or build his own, largely unmoderated site from scratch, Musk's 9% stake in Twitter suggests he may instead try to change Twitter from within.
Although Musk is now Twitter's largest shareholder, his stake is a ""passive investment,"" meaning under U.S. securities laws he is barred from seeking control of the company -- but that doesn't preclude him from doing so in the future, through active investments.
It also doesn't mean Musk must remain passive in communicating his thoughts about Twitter, in public or within the company, said Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance.
""He can always express his opinion,"" Elson said -- something Musk is not shy about. ""Buckle your seat belts.""
An ideological stance on America's content moderation debates isn't the only explanation for Musk's move. Twitter also plays a practical role in his business empire, especially as a PR tool.
""No one has profited more from the existence of Twitter than Elon Musk,"" said David Kirsch, a professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business and coauthor of the recent book ""Bubbles and Crashes."" ""Donald Trump used Twitter to win the presidency, but Elon Musk used it to sustain the Tesla narrative and support the stock when the company was in danger of collapse.""
Musk's is one of Twitter's most followed accounts. He tweets often to promote Tesla technology and SpaceX launches but also often creates controversy. Perhaps most infamous was a Musk tweet that implied a rescue diver was a pedophile after the man belittled Musk's plan to rescue children stuck in a cave in Thailand with a miniature submarine. Musk is also currently involved in a legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to a tweet in which he claimed he could take Tesla private at $420 per share.
""No one has been more adept at using Twitter to control public narrative"" than Musk, said Kirsch, who's currently researching the effect of Twitter bots on Tesla's stock price and reputation. (Bots are automated Twitter accounts created to resemble real people and are often used to flood the app with programmed messages.)
Musk may be investing ""if he believes that Twitter is adopting policies that limit his ability to use the platform,"" Kirsch added.
Musk's exact intentions, however, are hard to discern. His only tweet since news of the purchase went public has been a cheeky ""Oh hi lol.""
Were Twitter to pivot to a more absolutist free-speech policy, it probably would constrain the market available to those smaller platforms that have been pursuing that strategy for years.
Yet in statements to The Times, some such firms maintained that an ideological win is still a win.
""We appreciate Elon Musk validating our thesis and exploding interest in a market that Gab has pioneered for nearly six years now,"" said Andrew Torba, founder of the far right-friendly platform Gab, via email. ""Anything that promotes more speech and not less is a good thing in our book.""
Mark Weinstein, founder of the Facebook alternative MeWe, similarly maintained that ""Elon Musk becoming Twitter's largest shareholder is great news.""
""I am heartened that he will help return Twitter to its roots embracing free speech principles,"" Weinstein said in an email. ""Musk's investment will likely have a negative impact on newer Twitter alternatives such as Gettr and Truth Social. Social media is one of the most challenging industries to compete in.""
Parler CEO George Farmer wrote that he is encouraged by Musk's ""shared passion around the fundamental importance of free speech.""
Twitter did not respond to a request for comment as to whether the company anticipates any site policies changing as a result of Musk's investment, nor did it clarify how it will moderate Musk's personal account now that he's also a major stakeholder.
Regulatory filings describe Musk as a long-term investor looking to minimize his buying and selling of the shares. Industry analysts are skeptical about whether the mercurial CEO will remain on the sidelines.
""We would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter,"" Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said in a client note early Monday.
Twitter's stock surged more than 22% at the opening bell Monday.
SEC rules require that buyers of significant stakes in companies report their purchases to the agency within 10 days. On March 14, Musk bought the stake, according to his filing. He had filed nothing by March 25, when he posted a Twitter poll asking whether the platform adheres to the principles of free speech. He submitted his filing on April 4, 11 days late.
That could cause further problems for Musk. ""A deadline is a deadline, and the SEC can impose penalties,"" said Elson, the Weinberg Center director -- although, he added, Musk has shown that's something he's willing to tolerate.
Indeed, the CEO has clashed repeatedly with financial regulators over his use of Twitter. His latest purchase comes as he's locked in a bitter dispute with U.S. securities regulators over his ability to post on the site.
In October 2018, Musk and Tesla agreed to pay $40 million in civil fines and for Musk to have his tweets approved by a corporate lawyer after he tweeted about having the money to take Tesla private at $420 per share.
The funding was far from secured and the electric vehicle company remains public, but Tesla's stock price jumped. The settlement specified governance changes, including Musk's ouster as board chairman, as well as preapproval of his tweets. The SEC brought a securities fraud charge, alleging that Musk was manipulating the stock price with his posts.
Musk's lawyer is now asking a U.S. District Court judge in Manhattan to throw out the settlement, contending that the SEC is harassing him and infringing on his 1st Amendment rights.
Musk's revelation about his stake in Twitter shares comes two days after Tesla posted first-quarter delivery numbers.
Although the company delivered 310,000 vehicles in the period, the figure was slightly below expectations.
Shortly after tweeting in November about selling off some of his Tesla shares, Musk proceeded to do so, and he wrote on Twitter that the sale proceeds would be used to pay tax obligations on stock options. Analysts estimate his tax obligation at $10 billion to $15 billion. But some of the money could have been used to buy the Twitter stake.
So far, he has sold more than 15 million shares worth roughly $16.4 billion. With some sales in late December, Musk is close to selling 10%.

57,5-Apr-22,The Washington Post,Why Elon Musk is buying into Twitter,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2646840795/BFD812D457A14912PQ/346?accountid=13946,"The world is once again asking a question that seems to amuse Elon Musk at least as much as it captivates his followers: What does Elon want?
The latest object of Musk's desire is Twitter. He disclosed in a securities filing Monday that in mid-March he had taken a 9.2 percent stake in the short-burst social media company. Twitter's previously depressed stock price promptly shot up by almost 30 percent. This follows on Musk's own comments last week - on Twitter, naturally - that he was considering starting a new social media company, one whose algorithm would be generated by its users rather than by the company that owns the platform.
To reach the answer to the now-$41 billion question - that would be Twitter's new valuation - let's examine Musk's habits. For all his accomplishments, Musk has no history of investing in mature companies. He's the ultimate entrepreneur, having started, and this is a partial list, payments titan PayPal; rocket-maker SpaceX; brain-machine-interface start-up Neuralink; and the Boring Company, which aims to dig transport tunnels in big cities.
Despite a claim on Tesla's corporate website, Musk did not start Tesla. But he did invest early on, and Musk became Tesla's driving force. Today the electric carmaker is a main source of his $270 billion fortune. So, it's certainly possible that Musk intends to buy all of Twitter. Musk has a long history of doing exactly what he says he'll do. Taking him at his word that he wants to own a social media firm, it's more than reasonable that Musk looked at Donald Trump's embarrassing debut of the woke-resistant platform Truth Social and concluded he'd rather commit a sliver of his net worth to taking over Twitter than starting a rival from scratch.
Musk, after all, is a Twitter power user. He commands an audience of more than 80 million followers, and he tweets to them incessantly on topics ranging from (in recent days) his love of Berlin, understanding the universe, covid-19 and his various companies. His tweet Monday following the disclosure of his Twitter stake was the cryptic ""Oh hi lol."" It was liked more than 350,000 times and generated more than 35,000 comments.
It isn't altogether clear why Musk would need to own the cow when he drinks so freely of the milk. He might simply feel he can do a better job at running Twitter. For all of the company's success, it is perennially thought of in Silicon Valley as a product also-ran. Its valuation trails those of Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook) and even Snap (Snapchat). He also wouldn't be the first tech titan to make a run at Twitter. Salesforce's Marc Benioff tried in 2016 to buy Twitter for $20 billion but was discouraged by his colleagues, directors and investors. By the way: Musk's Twitter stake is in his name, not Tesla's.
And though Musk has been lauded for his real-world, physical product innovations, he's not immune from the allure of media mogul-dom. He sits on the board of Endeavor Group Holdings, the talent agency and entertainment company run by Ari Emanuel, alongside mega-private-equity investor Egon Durban, whose Silver Lake invested $1 billion in Twitter two years ago, though Musk has announced he plans to exit the board in June.
Twitter also provides a potential launchpad for bitcoin, another of Musk's obsessions. He takes bold stands in favor of the cryptocurrency from time to time, and Tesla both holds bitcoin on its balance sheet and at one point accepted bitcoin as a payment method. Given Twitter's reach and the way it uses software to connect far-flung users, Musk could see it as the ultimate vehicle to realize a long-held dream of promoting a nongovernmental, global currency.
It's equally possible Musk isn't serious about taking over Twitter and that instead he is probing, goofing, needling and otherwise entertaining himself, his fans and his antagonists. He unhappily agreed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018 to vet his tweets with Tesla lawyers after the regulator objected to his Twitter musings that he'd take Tesla private. (Shareholders can thank the SEC for thwarting Musk. He mulled buying out the company at $420 per share. Today, Tesla's stock trades for more than $1,100 per share.) Would owning all of Twitter give Musk more or less leverage with the SEC? Might his friendly relationship with the powers that be in China, where Tesla operates a factory, help Twitter enter that market, where it is now banned? Has Musk thought about such things?
That the sky is not the limit for Musk's aspirations is the stuff of cliche. But his ambition truly is boundless. In a recent interview with the CEO of German media conglomerate Axel Springer, Musk said he'd be happy if humanity could build a self-sustaining city on Mars. ""I think we really just got this little candle of consciousness, like a small light in the void,"" he said. ""And we do not want this small candle in the darkness to be put out.""
Next to that, buying Twitter seems downright trivial.

58,5-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Stocks Drop as Investors Fret About Fed's Plans to Tame Inflation; Investors parse remarks from Federal Reserve governor about central bank's plans to reduce inflation,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2646880138/BFD812D457A14912PQ/371?accountid=13946,"U.S. stock indexes declined Tuesday as investors weighed the prospect of more assertive actions by the Federal Reserve to curb inflation.
The S&P 500 fell 57.52 points, or 1.3%, to 4525.12, a day after the indexes were pulled higher by rallying technology stocks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 328.39 points, or 2.3%, to 14204.17. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 280.70 points, or 0.8%, to 34641.18.
Fed governor Lael Brainard said at a conference Tuesday that the central bank is strongly committed to taking steps that will cut inflation this year, including by announcing a significant reduction in its $9 trillion asset portfolio next month.
Reducing the Fed's balance sheet, reversing its efforts to stimulate the economy through the purchase of Treasury securities and mortgage bonds, will help lift market interest rates —and make stocks more expensive relative to less risky assets, said John Lynch, chief investment officer at Comerica Wealth Management.
The stock market's selloff accelerated, and government bond yields jumped, after Ms. Brainard's remarks.
""The catalyst for today was Lael Brainard's comments,"" Mr. Lynch said. ""She sounded a little more aggressive on the balance-sheet rolloff than the markets anticipated.""
Before Tuesday's selloff, the Nasdaq had climbed more than 15% since touching a 52-week low on March 14. The index is still off about 12% from November's record.
Investors also were assessing what a fresh round of sanctions against Russia might look like.
Reports of Russian atrocities inflicted on Ukrainian civilians in occupied areas have shocked Western governments, which have called for additional sanctions on Russia. Sanctions have already sent oil prices soaring above $100 a barrel and lifted prices for a number of other commodities. That has heaped pressure on economies already facing multidecade high inflation.
In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, lost 89 cents, or 0.8%, to $106.64 a barrel.
""Markets are in a limbo state,"" said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. ""Investors are waiting for the Fed meeting minutes tomorrow. And next week is earnings season. We need some corporate updates to see how the first quarter went and, more importantly, what the outlook is.""
Twitter shares rose $1.01, or 2%, to $50.98 after the company said it would appoint Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk to its board . The increase added to a 27% gain Monday that came after Mr. Musk disclosed he held a 9.2% stake in the social-media company.
Many other tech-related stocks fell, with information-technology among the weakest groups in the S&P 500. Applied Materials dropped $7.73, or 6%, to $121.71. Teradyne dropped $7.03, or 5.9%, to $111.91.
Investors are carefully watching the Fed—which has embarked on a course of interest rate rises for the first time since 2018—to see if it can tighten monetary policy just enough to tamp down surging inflation but not so much that it damages the economy.
The release of minutes on Wednesday from the Fed's March 15-16 meeting may shed further light on internal debates over the pace of future increases, inflation pressures and potential economic fallout from Russia's attack on Ukraine.
""We know the Fed is going to raise rates—the pace of which we can debate—and that growth is slowing,"" said Kara Murphy, chief investment officer of Kestra Holdings. ""This is going to be a bumpy road."" Ms. Murphy said she favors quality stocks with strong balance sheets that can withstand a slowdown in the economy.
One guide investors are looking to is the bond market, where the yield on the two-year Treasury note briefly rose above the 10-year's yield—producing what is known as an inverted yield curve. That is often taken as a predictor of a recession.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 2.554% on Tuesday from 2.409% on Monday. The yield on the two-year note rose to 2.502% from 2.426%.
""Right now it is flashing a big warning signal,"" Ms. Murphy said of the yield curve. ""It is very clearly telling us the economy is slowing.""
An Institute for Supply Management survey of purchasing managers showed the U.S. services sector picked up in March after softening for three straight months. The ISM report on Business PMI increased to 58.3 in March from 56.5 in February, matching the forecast from economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.
In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.2%. In Asia, stock markets mostly inched higher. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 gained 0.2% while in Korea, the Kospi index added less than 0.1%. Stock markets in Hong Kong and mainland China were closed Tuesday for a public holiday.

59,5-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),What Will Elon Musk Do at Twitter? He's Already Doing It.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2646996042/BFD812D457A14912PQ/387?accountid=13946,"Twitter added more than $10 billion in market value over two days because an avid tweeter who makes futuristic cars bought a ton of shares and joined the board.
I'm oversimplifying. He also launches reusable rockets.
Now Wall Street is trying to figure out something it already knows the answer to: What will Elon Musk do at Twitter (ticker: TWTR)?
Maybe he'll push for an edit button. Maybe he'll try to spring a certain former president from Twitter jail. But most important for investors, he is likely to make the stock run up, with or without trying.
That's kind of his thing. Twitter should be ready to halt its stock buybacks, and maybe even become a seller, if the meme-trading winds blow favorably.
Musk is the Reddit trader's Warren Buffett, in that his mere mention of an asset, to say nothing of his investment in one, can send other investors scrambling to buy. Until now, he has focused much of his analysis on meme stocks and trash coins. ""GameStonk!"" he tweeted a little more than a year ago, after GameStop (GME) shares had gained 92% in a day. They went up another 134% the following day.
""Tesla merch buyable with dogecoin,"" he had tweeted days earlier, sending the parody crypto 13% higher. And just before that he had written, ""Use Signal,"" which was a reference to a messaging app, not an investment call. It nonetheless moon-rocketed an unrelated penny stock called Signal Advance by more than 6,000% over the following three days.
MORE TWITTER MUST-READS
With Twitter, Musk recently bought a personal stake-–9.2% of the company, on which he has already made a profit of more than $1 billion. His securities filing implies that his position is a passive one.
The company has already set ambitious goals for itself. In February of last year, it told analysts that it wants to increase its daily average user base from 192 million to 315 million by 2023, while doubling revenues to $7.5 billion.
Wall Street isn't quite convinced. It predicts 293 million users by the end of next year, and revenues of $7.3 billion. Maybe Musk, who at Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX has proved as successful an entrepreneur as America has seen, has ideas to bridge the gap.
But for now, Parag Agrawal, the former Twitter tech chief who succeded founder Jack Dorsey as CEO in November, should be thinking of ways to quietly walk back something he announced in February: a $4 billion stock buyback plan. It includes $2 billion in accelerated purchases, and $2 billion more over time.
Aggressive buybacks are for stock market losers, which Twitter was as recently as last week. The stock ended last Friday at $39 and change, versus the nearly $45 it closed at on its first day of trading back in 2013. But now it is time to pause and watch what happens. ""Get out the popcorn,"" as Tesla analyst Dan Ives at Wedbush wrote in a Tuesday note.
MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni downgraded Twitter to Neutral from Buy before the market opened on Tuesday, writing that the risks and potential rewards of the stock looked balanced at $49 a share. Justin Post at BofA Securities stuck with his Buy rating, calling the valuation of 5.5 times next year's projected revenues attractive. ""While Mr. Musk's purchase may not drive any changes to execution and performance, the news does highlight platform value to potential acquirers, or those who think Twitter could have more value with change,"" he wrote.
If Twitter stock fizzles from here, buybacks might make more sense. But if it goes full GameStop or AMC Entertainment (AMC), then Agrawal can consider following the template set by those two, and issuing new shares. Or he can use shares to fund an acquisition.
The key thing is not to let a good speculative frenzy, if it develops, go to waste.

60,5-Apr-22,New York Daily News,"If you can't tweet 'em, join 'em: Musk buys 9% stake in Twitter",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2646882580/BFD812D457A14912PQ/420?accountid=13946,"Just weeks after publicly questioning whether Twitter holds up free speech, Elon Musk dropped nearly $3 billion to become its largest stakeholder.
The Tesla CEO purchased a 9.2% stake in the social media company, more than quadruple the position of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing released Monday.
Based on Twitter's closing price Monday, Musk's newly acquired 73,486,938 shares are worth $3.67 billion.
The 50-year-old entrepreneur hasn't publicly commented on his purchase, but it comes as he has seemingly grown more upset with how Twitter does business.
""Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?"" he tweeted alongside a poll on March 25. ""The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully.""
Of more than 2 million votes, 70.4% of respondents said ""no.""
""Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy,"" he wrote in a followup tweet. ""What should be done?""
Days later, he said he was ""giving serious thought"" to building his own social media platform when asked by a follower.
At less than 10%, Musk's ownership of Twitter is considered ""passive"" by Wall Street's measures, but he could still wield massive power in how the social media site operates moving forward.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is currently investigating Musk for his November tweet asking fans whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla stake, causing shares in the company to plummet.
In 2018, Musk and Tesla were each fined $20 million by the SEC for his tweets about securing funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share, which also caused a market collapse. Musk resigned as the Tesla chairman as part of the settlement over the fraud charges but remained CEO."
61,5-Apr-22,Washington Examiner,How Musk could use the free-speech leverage granted by his Twitter stock buy,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2647090732/BFD812D457A14912PQ/436?accountid=13946,"Tesla Founder Elon Musk has bought himself leverage in swaying Twitter's controversial handling of speech on its platform after suddenly becoming the company's largest shareholder.
Musk, the world's wealthiest person and a critic of Twitter's handling of speech, appears poised to shake up the massive social media network after buying 9.2% of the company.
""The ultimate endpoint of it all is that if you feel like companies are doing a bad job at content moderation or doing it in a way that is not proper, you have options,"" Ari Cohn, free speech counsel at TechFreedom, told the Washington Examiner. ""You can either build your own, or you can try to exert some kind of pressure on companies to do things differently.""
Musk's purchase, revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing published on Monday, likely cost the Tesla and SpaceX founder nearly $3 billion. 
BIG TECH FACES RENEWED SCRUTINY FOR HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP CENSORSHIP
The move was portended by a Twitter poll last month when Musk asked his 79 million Twitter followers whether they think the social media giant facilitates free speech. As of Monday afternoon, more than 2 million people had responded to the survey, with a vast majority, more than 70%, challenging that notion.
""The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully,"" Musk added.
""Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy. What should be done?"" Musk asked. ""Is a new platform needed?""
Mark Weinstein, founder of social media service MeWe and an expert in privacy and free speech, told the Washington Examiner that Musk's decision to purchase such a large stake in the company is a major move and is ""significant, not symbolic.""
Musk's holding now far overshadows that of other individual investors, including the stake owned by Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey, who owns 2.25% of the company. 
It is worth noting that the form Musk used to disclose the holdings is one that indicates he isn't planning to engage in activism or join the board, although he could eventually transition his ""passive"" position to an active one in future filings.
However, Musk is hoping to see a social media platform on which free speech is plentiful, according to Weinstein.
""There's an old philosophy: The best way to change something is from the inside,"" Weinstein said. ""So he goes inside, he becomes the largest shareholder, he now has influence on the future of Twitter … It's clear he has a philosophy, it's clear he made what he believes is a very smart move, it's clear he definitely will have influence on Twitter.""
Weinstein predicted it wouldn't be long until Musk finds himself at a seat on Twitter's board, which would allow him to push the company further to bend to a model favoring increased expression of free speech and transparency with its algorithms.
Twitter has faced blowback, especially in conservative circles, for its moves to censor or add context to certain posts. The social media banned former President Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 riot and temporarily prevented a New York Post story about Hunter Biden from being shared just before the 2020 election. Even more recently, Twitter has suspended accounts for referring to U.S. Assistant Secretary of Health Rachel Levine, who identifies as a transgender woman, as a man.
Twitter is facing three main competitors: Gettr, Parler, and former President Donald Trump's Truth Social, according to Weinstein. Musk's decision to invest in Twitter and shun investing in the other companies further bolsters Twitter's standing among the competition and is, on balance, a net negative for the other social media networks.
Musk's musings and statements about Twitter provide a guide for the changes he might seek. 
Last month, the billionaire posted another survey asking his followers whether Twitter's algorithm should be open-source. More than 82% of respondents agreed it should, and Dorsey even joined in the conversation.
""The choice of which algorithm to use (or not) should be open to everyone,"" said Dorsey, who announced his resignation in November.
Weinstein described Musk as a ""dancer"" and said the investor might make one dance move and then immediately pivot to another move or approach.
It is likely the board will extend an invitation for Musk to have a seat because it would make more business sense to keep the company's largest investor close and on the inside rather than outside slinging mud at Twitter, he said.
""I think that's very likely to happen quickly, I think Musk's philosophy is going to impact the platform,"" Weinstein said.
Musk now has upward and downward leverage over the company's finances in the sense that he can choose to either buy even more of the company or sell his shares.
If he buys more shares, it would boost the stock price of Twitter and benefit the shareholders, to whom the board answers. Alternatively, Musk could get angry and offload some of his holdings and hurt the company financially.
""He's got huge leverage now as an investor, and I think we'll see him use that leverage,"" Weinstein said.
Musk has also used the Twitter platform to express his seemingly libertarian political views. Earlier this year he tweeted that President Joe Biden is ""treating the American public like fools.""

While Biden was trying to enact his now-dead Build Back Better tax and spending plan, Musk blasted the ""trickery"" of the bill, channeling the words of free-market economist Milton Friedman.
""Nothing is more permanent than a 'temporary' government program,"" the billionaire said, which is a nearly exact quote from Friedman, who was known for his defense of free-market capitalism and one of the leaders of the Chicago school of economics.

Twitter, after a fight with activist Elliott Management Corp., said a little over a year ago that it would work to at least double its revenue to $7.5 billion by the end of 2023, and reach at least 315 million so-called monetizable daily active users at that time.
The company reached $5.08 billion in revenue at the end of last year, up 37% from the previous year. User numbers increased 13% to about 217 million daily users. If the company maintains this pace through the end of 2023, it would exceed its revenue target, though miss the mark for enlarging its user base.
""Musk, who clearly enjoys the platform with his sometimes controversial and always entertaining tweets, brings an air of excitement to the company,"" said analyst Daniel Newman of Futurum Research, an advisory business that focuses on digital technology. ""His larger role in the company could pave the way for more user growth and a likely better-than-average market performance as investors will be betting on his contributions to the company's next wave of growth.""
Mr. Musk, a longtime Twitter user now with more than 80 million followers, has repeatedly demonstrated his tweets spur the kind of debate online that help drive user engagement on social-media platforms and, with that, revenue. The Tesla Inc. chief executive has sparked arguments on Twitter on a range of topics, including his electric-car company and—because he runs SpaceX— planetary travel. His missives have moved markets and the price of the cryptocurrency bitcoin .
Twitter shares rose on the day Mr. Musk's investment became public and on the following day, when his board appointment was announced. The gains added roughly $10 billion in market cap over the period, a sign of investor enthusiasm regarding the billionaire entrepreneur's role at the company. Twitter shares declined 0.43% in Wednesday trading, closing at $50.76.
Mr. Musk has long been heavily engaged on Twitter, at times bantering on the platform with founder Jack Dorsey. On Jan. 31, he began a weekslong Twitter-share buying spree that turned him from a regular user of the platform into the company's largest investor, with a stake of more than 9% . On Monday, Twitter appointed Mr. Musk to its board .
""We believe Musk's presence alone will help drive greater interest, and we view him as the most influential person attached to the company,"" Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, wrote in a note. ""Ultimately, the goal is to better monetize the platform, and we think Musk can only help, not hurt the process, with his recent criticism of the company as a refreshing sign.""
Over the past two years, Twitter has experimented with new features and products intended to fuel user engagement and more revenue, with mixed results.
In late 2020, the company launched Fleets, a feature that allowed users to post full-screen photos and videos that disappeared after a day, similar to the stories features available on rival services Instagram and Snapchat. The company shut down that feature in August 2021 , saying ""we haven't seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped.""
Twitter had more success with a feature it began testing in December 2020 called Spaces, which let users congregate in audio-only rooms. The feature was successful enough in testing to be launched a few months later to Twitter users with more than 600 followers.
The company followed that with Twitter Blue, a paid version that offers subscribers exclusive features. Twitter rolled out the feature in June 2021 to users in Canada and Australia and opened the subscription service more broadly in the U.S. and New Zealand on Nov. 9. Among the features included in the $2.99 monthly service is the ability for subscribers to use nonfungible tokens they own as their Twitter profile pictures.
The addition of Mr. Musk to Twitter's board could spur further ""idea generation,"" Mr. Zino said. ""That's something that's much needed when you look at the Twitter platform. It's clearly lacked some innovation over the last several years.""
Twitter declined to comment.
There are also potential points of friction between Mr. Musk and Twitter, which in recent years stepped up its content moderation to address concerns that discourse on the platform had become a turnoff for some users. Mr. Musk, who has described himself as a ""free-speech absolutist,"" has raised questions about Twitter's approach to the issue. ""Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?"" he tweeted last month.
Some analysts said Mr. Musk could influence Twitter to ease up on content moderation or reinstate users, such as Donald Trump. The company banned the account of the then-president in January 2021, citing what it said was a risk of incitement to violence. That move drew sharp criticism from Mr. Trump and some of his supporters.
Such changes could spur user growth and engagement if more users come onto the service and more debates are sparked, but it could also scare away advertisers, said Ali Mogharabi, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.
""There have been some advertisers that favor content moderation,"" Mr. Mogharabi said. ""If there's more, as Musk put it, freedom of speech, then you could see some advertisers not necessarily pull out completely but just be a little bit more hesitant because they fear that their ads may be placed along with some bad content or conflicting content.""
Broadly, analysts expect the outspoken billionaire to help, rather than hurt, Twitter. ""The Musk faithful will read this as a big bet on the Twitter platform, and if anyone can help Twitter realize its full potential it's going to be a profile exactly like Musk,"" Futurum Research's Mr. Newman said.

 Elon Musk Stirs Twitter Interest as Social-Media Platform Hunts Growth 
Credit: By Salvador Rodriguez "
63,6-Apr-22,Portland Press Herald,Elon Musk's Twitter investment could be bad news for free speech The Tesla founder's decision suggests that he wants to bring the social media platform to heel.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2647078681/BFD812D457A14912PQ/232?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk just bought a $3 billion stake in Twitter, because when you're the world's richest human you can toss billions around like poker chips.
This may be just another piece of performance art from Musk, who has alternately endorsed and pooh-poohed Bitcoin to great effect. He's also taken to Twitter to hype altcoins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, while simultaneously warning followers: ""Don't bet the farm on crypto!""
""True value is building products & providing services to your fellow human beings, not money in any form,"" he cautioned, which may be easy advice to give when your net worth is $273 billion, your electric vehicle company is surging and you can shoot your own rockets into space.
So maybe we should take Musk's Twitter investment as more of the same from the guy who has pondered the meaning of life while sipping whiskey and smoking weed during a podcast and once mysteriously claimed he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. But I suspect something more serious is informing Musk's decision to invest in Twitter, even if he revels in buffoonery: Maybe he wants to bring Twitter to heel.
Consider the poll he conducted (on Twitter, of course) 10 days ago. ""Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy,"" it says. ""Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?"" More than 2 million users responded to that question, with 70.4 percent of them voting ""no.""
A day later, Musk, who fashions himself a ""free speech absolutist,"" was on the social media platform again: ""Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy. What should be done?"" This time he didn't bother with a poll, asking: ""Is a new platform needed?""
All of this follows Musk's ongoing battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been monitoring his Twitter posts for a very good reason: They move markets. Musk maintained in a court filing that the SEC's oversight seems ""calculated to chill his exercise"" of free speech.
So despite ample room in which to exercise his speech - and aggressively trying to curtail the free speech of some of his critics - Musk evidently feels aggrieved. What's not clear is why Twitter is his target.
His Twitter rants have been wide-ranging and unfettered. He once tweeted, then deleted, a meme comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Hitler. He's tweeted transphobic memes. He's slagged a British cave explorer as a ""pedo guy."" That's a lot of free speech, and Twitter has done little to curtail it.
One explanation for Musk's sensitivity might be found in his libertarian leanings. Belated efforts by social media platforms to constrain some of the most virulent forms of political propaganda have raised the hackles of that crowd (along with far-rightists and Trumpistas). Now Musk has at least fired a shot across Twitter's bow by purchasing 9.2 percent of its stock - which is also much less expensive than doing the same to Facebook (a 9.2 percent stake in Meta would have cost him about $58 billion).
Does Musk want to take over Twitter? I don't think so. The company's financials aren't great, and running social media companies is hard. The car crash that is former President Donald Trump's social media experiment, Truth Social, is a cautionary tale for Musk. Does Musk want to name some people to Twitter's board of directors? Maybe. That would allow him to have some say over its affairs without spending too much time or money.
That's worrisome because it's not ideal to have a free speech absolutist who isn't absolutely in favor of free speech at the helm of - or even close to - a media company. Musk has already received a nice pop on his Twitter stake. The shares jumped 26 percent Monday after his investment was disclosed in a regulatory filing. He'll stick around longer, of course, and speculation that Twitter may be in play will further inflate his holdings.
But Musk probably isn't in this for the money. He's in it to make a point. And he's in it to scare Twitter's management. Somebody who has complained that his free speech is being ""chilled"" should, perhaps, be sensitive to those nuances. That would assume, however, that Musk is more of a philosopher than a bully.

65,6-Apr-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)","Aiming to Change Twitter, Musk Joins Its Board: [Correction]",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2647071738/BFD812D457A14912PQ/287?accountid=13946,"Free speech, open-source algorithms -- and an edit button: The world's richest person will soon help steer the social media platform where he has a huge following.Elon Musk, the world's richest man, reached out to Parag Agrawal, Twitter's chief executive, a few weeks ago with a friendly heads-up. He was buying shares of the social media company, Mr. Musk confided, and wanted to discuss how to make Twitter better.Mr. Musk had ideas for reshaping social networks that dovetailed with those of Mr. Agrawal and Jack Dorsey, Twitter's co-founder, according to their public exchanges. All three have floated the notion of radically shifting the power in social networking to users and away from behemoth companies, by using an approach to technology that would give people control over what they see in their social media feeds.In the ensuing weeks, Mr. Agrawal discussed having Mr. Musk become a more active participant in Twitter's future, according to two people with knowledge of the conversations who were not authorized to speak publicly. Mr. Agrawal also welcomed having Mr. Musk -- who has more than 80 million Twitter followers and sometimes tweets a dozen or more times a day -- join the company's board, one of the people said.On Tuesday, Twitter announced that Mr. Musk, 50, would be appointed to its 11-person board in a term that expires in 2024. That followed the revelation on Monday that Mr. Musk had accumulated a 9.2 percent stake in Twitter, making him its biggest shareholder. Mr. Musk has agreed not to own more than 14.9 percent of Twitter's stock or take over the company, which is based in San Francisco, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.""Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our board,"" Mr. Agrawal tweeted on Tuesday.The addition of one of Twitter's most powerful users to its board has implications for a social network where world leaders, lawmakers, celebrities and more than 217 million users conduct their daily public discourse. Unlike some other Twitter board members, Mr. Musk did not sign an agreement that forbade him from influencing the company's policies. That could allow him to work with Mr. Agrawal on a futuristic vision for ""decentralized"" social networking.That vision challenges the way that platforms are created. Core technologies would be built publicly and transparently, with oversight and input from coders around the world. Users could then customize their social media feeds and establish their own rules about what kinds of speech are acceptable. That's very different from how social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram are now set up, with the companies dictating what posts can stay up and what should be removed.The plan jibes with Mr. Musk's, Mr. Dorsey's and Mr. Agrawal's beliefs in unfettered free speech. Mr. Musk has criticized Twitter for moderating its platform too restrictively and has said more speech should be allowed. Mr. Dorsey, too, grappled with the decision to boot former President Donald J. Trump off the service last year, saying he did not ""celebrate or feel pride"" in the move. Mr. Agrawal has said that public conversation provides an inherent good for society.Their positions have increasingly become outliers in a global debate over free speech online, as more people have questioned whether too much free speech has enabled the spread of misinformation and divisive content.In a tweet on Tuesday, Mr. Musk, who leads the companies Tesla and SpaceX, said he hoped to ""make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months."" He did not elaborate and did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Agrawal and Mr. Dorsey also did not respond to requests for comment.A Twitter spokesman said Mr. Musk would not have a hand in policymaking at the company. Day-to-day policy decisions would still be made by Twitter employees, he said, and the company would be impartial in developing and enforcing its rules.Mr. Musk could bring turbulence to Twitter. He has long used the service as a cudgel, trolling short-sellers of Tesla and insulting critics. He has also spread inaccurate information about the pandemic. After he mused about taking Tesla private in a tweet in 2018 and inaccurately claimed he had secured funding for the transaction, he was fined $40 million by the S.E.C.His appointment to Twitter's board was celebrated on Tuesday by some Republicans, who have accused the company of political bias and censoring right-wing voices. ""Musk. Free speech,"" said Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican of Ohio.(Democrats, whom Mr. Musk has tangled with online over the party's proposed wealth tax, were not vocal.)David Kaye, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who formerly worked with the United Nations on speech issues, warned that Mr. Musk's vision for free speech could conflict with Twitter's policies, which are intended to govern conversations around the globe.""The risk is that his individual and personal business preferences, which are sometimes idiosyncratic, are going to influence rule-making and enforcement in a way that is inappropriate for a company that, in his words, is a version of a public square,"" he said.Twitter's move toward a ""decentralized"" social network is rooted in some of its top leaders' unhappiness with how the platform has become an arbiter of what speech is allowed online and what is not. While Twitter's users exercise some control over their social media feeds -- such as by choosing the people they follow -- the service's algorithm picks what posts are seen at the top of their feeds and the company can decide whether to ban accounts based on whether posts have violated its policies.Mr. Dorsey, who stepped down as Twitter's chief executive in November, has said that users should have more power over which posts they see so they can make their own moderation choices. Last week, he lamented in a tweet that the centralization of the internet by corporations had damaged the web.""I realize I'm partially to blame, and regret it,"" he wrote.In 2019, Mr. Dorsey financed a project called Bluesky, an effort to develop new infrastructure for social media that would give users control over their data, curating top tweets with their own algorithms and allowing them to move their data to other platforms.""We believe that people should have choices about the key algorithms that affect their experience online,"" Mr. Dorsey testified in Congress in 2020, calling the concept ""an exciting, market-driven approach where people can choose what algorithms filter their content so they can have the experience they want.""At the same time, Mr. Musk has dabbled in technologies for decentralizing control. In 2015, alongside the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Sam Altman and others, Mr. Musk founded an artificial intelligence lab called OpenAI, saying the company would openly share its research with the world at large. Mr. Musk later parted ways with the company.Whether a decentralized Twitter could come together is unclear. It could take years to emerge because it would involve a complicated process of revamping the entire platform.By March 14, Mr. Musk, who has a net worth of $270 billion-plus, had accumulated a more than 5 percent stake in Twitter, according to a company filing. After that, he began voicing more of his thoughts about Twitter and free speech on the service, including in exchanges with Mr. Dorsey.""Twitter algorithm should be open source,"" Mr. Musk tweeted on March 24, asking his followers to vote ""yes"" or ""no"" on the idea of making the code powering Twitter's algorithm publicly available. Such ""open"" algorithms could give people more options for arranging their feeds as they wish and prioritizing different kinds of content.Mr. Dorsey immediately agreed. ""The choice of which algorithm to use (or not) should be open to everyone,"" he tweeted in response.On March 25, Mr. Musk asked his followers if Twitter was failing to adhere to free speech principles. ""Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?"" he asked.A day later, after more than two million users responded, Mr. Musk wrote, ""Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy.""""Is a new platform needed?"" he added.On Monday, in one of his first tweets after his stake was disclosed, Mr. Musk posted another Twitter poll asking people whether they wanted to be able to edit tweets, a feature that many have fruitlessly requested.Mr. Agrawal jumped in, tweeting, ""The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully."" The company later said it had been working on an edit feature since last year and would soon test it.Mr. Dorsey weighed in on Tuesday after Mr. Musk's appointment to Twitter's board was official. The development made him ""really happy,"" he tweeted.Cade Metz contributed reporting.Cade Metz contributed reporting.PhotographElon Musk could urge sweeping change at Twitter, such as ""decentralized"" social networking.

66,6-Apr-22,New York Daily News,"Musk, an 'intense critic,' joins Twitter's leadership",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2647101461/BFD812D457A14912PQ/486?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has scored a board seat at Twitter.
Just a day after buying up 9.2% of the social media site's stock, Musk has been named to Twitter's board of directors.
""Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our board,"" CEO Parag Agrawal tweeted Tuesday morning.
""He's both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service which is exactly what we need on Twitter, and in the boardroom, to make us stronger in the long-term.""
Musk (inset), in response, said he was ""looking forward to working ... to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months!""
The deal, though, comes with a catch for the Tesla titan: in exchange for his board seat, he cannot buy more than 14.9% of Twitter's common stock for the duration of his tenure, plus 90 days after, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Tuesday.
It's unclear if Musk had plans to continue buying up stock or if this was a precautionary measure on Twitter's part.
The board seat is for a Class II director, and the term will expire in 2024.
Late Monday, Musk used his new authority to broach the most controversial subject on Twitter, the addition of an edit button.
As of 9 a.m. on Tuesday, the poll had more than 2.9 million votes, with about 74% of respondents voting yes.
Musk's more than 73 million shares were worth about $2.9 billion at the close of trading Friday and jumped to $3.5 billion Monday after the announcement of his purchase. Neither he nor the SEC revealed when he actually bought the shares.
Last month, he mused about Twitter's role in protecting free speech.
""Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?"" the 50-year-old entrepreneur tweeted alongside a poll on March 25. ""The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully.""
Of more than 2 million votes, 70.4% of respondents said ""no.""
Musk's use of his own free speech has gotten him in trouble before, slapped with a $20 million fine by the SEC in 2018 after his tweets about securing funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share caused a market collapse. Musk resigned as the Tesla chairman as part of the settlement over the fraud charges but was allowed to stay on as CEO."
67,6-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),What the Fed Minutes Will Tell Us About the Next Bond Inversion,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2647133281/BFD812D457A14912PQ/565?accountid=13946,"The Federal Reserve is going to continue raising interest rates, soon and aggressively—that much is known. The next surprise will probably relate to how quickly it sells off the massive bondholdings it has acquired over the past decade.
Since the March increase, Chair Jerome Powell has more or less confirmed that a series of 50-point moves is coming. Lael Brainard, typically dovish, signaled that she is on board with rapid action to get inflation under control.
However, the market-moving part of Brainard's comments on Tuesday concerned the Fed's bond sales, or quantitative tightening. She said the Fed will begin a ""rapid"" reduction of its $9 trillion balance sheet as soon as next month. A key part of the minutes due out Wednesday will be the committee's views on how unloading those bonds will affect the economy.
The prospect of the central bank flooding the market pushed up the yield on 10-year bonds to the highest in almost three years and dragged it out of a recession-signaling inversion . But the fear that Fed action may soon need to be reversed hasn't necessarily abated.
The biggest question right now is how well quantitative tightening will work. Will it continue to drive up longer-term yields? How much will it tighten financial conditions? Will it help to curb inflation, or will it just be a sideshow to the interest-rate increases?
There have been a few big experiments in central banking since the financial crisis with quantitative easing and forward guidance. Another one is about to start.

U.S. and EU to Hit Russia With Further Sanctions
The U.S. and the European Union are set to impose additional sanctions on Russia after gruesome images of war that emerged over the weekend helped coalesce international support to raise the pressure on Moscow for its aggression in Ukraine.
* The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, proposed broad new sanctions, including banning imports of Russian coal, cutting the access by Russian road and shipping goods carriers into Europe, targeting more oligarchs and their families, and blocking some machinery exports, The Wall Street Journal reported.
* The U.S. on Wednesday will announce bans on all new investments in Russia, in addition to sanctions against Russian financial institutions, state-owned enterprises, and Russian government officials and their families, the White House said.
* The White House could tighten restrictions on the Russian banks that are already being sanctioned, such as Sberbank, Russia's largest financial institution, the Journal reported.
What's Next: A ban on Russian coal would mark the first time EU member states agreed to block imports of Russian energy supplies. EU nations are divided on banning imports of Russian oil and gas, although the idea of a phased-in embargo of Russian oil is gaining support.

Elon Musk's Stake in Twitter Isn't 'Passive' Anymore
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has refiled the disclosure of his stake in Twitter to reflect the change in status from passive to active investor after being named a board member at the social-media company. Musk made the disclosure on Tuesday in a 13D filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that showed his intention to be more active in Twitter's business.
* The filing showed that Musk owns 73,115,038 Twitter shares, or 9.1% of the company, making him its biggest stockholder.
* On Monday, Musk disclosed in a 13G filing that he had bought a 9.2% stake in Twitter worth $2.89 billion based on the company's closing share price on Friday. The 13G form is meant to be used by investors who plan to hold their shares passively, without trying to exert any influence over a company.
* The change to show he is now an active investor followed an announcement by Twitter and its CEO Parag Agrawal that it had appointed Musk to the board.
What's Next: Like most of Musk's public expressions, his disclosure of his Twitter stake has enriched him and his fellow shareholders. Here's hoping he can pursue his free speech aims on Twitter while continuing to lift Twitter's stock.

JetBlue Competing With Frontier to Buy Spirit Airlines
JetBlue Airways is competing with Frontier Group Holdings to buy ultra-low-cost Spirit Airlines, making an unsolicited all-cash bid of $33 per share, or $3.6 billion. Frontier announced plans in February to buy Spirit for $2.9 billion in cash and stock, and become the nation's fifth-largest airline.
* JetBlue said its offer is better for Spirit investors, coming in 37% higher than the value of Frontier's proposal. But Frontier's proposal would let Spirit's shareholders keep a 48.5% stake in the merged carrier. Spirit said its board would weigh JetBlue's offer.
* Frontier Chairman William Franke, who helped transform both Spirit and Frontier into ultradiscount carriers, has spent years hoping to merge them. Spirit and Frontier, known for rock-bottom fares, have said merging would bring low-cost flights to underserved markets in the U.S., Latin America, and the Caribbean.
* A Frontier spokesperson told Barron's that its deal would deliver ""$1 billion in annual savings for consumers and offer even more ultralow fares to more places nationwide, creating America's most competitive ultralow fare airline.""
* The Justice Department last year sued to block JetBlue's partnership with American Airlines, saying it would reduce competition, limit options for customers, and lead to higher fares. Frontier on Tuesday pointed to JetBlue's ""significant"" East Coast overlap with Spirit.
What's Next: Any merger would be scrutinized by regulators, who have increased their antitrust enforcement. Some Democratic lawmakers have argued against a Spirit-Frontier merger to antitrust and transportation officials, saying it would hurt consumers by reducing competition.

Federal Government Aims to Better Address 'Long Covid'
Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra is coordinating a governmentwide response to ""Long Covid,"" including efforts to understand the condition and prevent, diagnose, treat, and improve services for people experiencing prolonged illness from Covid-19.
* The more contagious Omicron coronavirus subvariant BA.2 is now projected to be 72% of circulating variants nationwide, and is the majority in all U.S. regions, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Average Covid-19 cases declined 4.2% from last week, to 25,074.
* Democrats are trying to push through $10 billion in funding for the administration's Covid-19 efforts, but on Tuesday Republicans sought to make a vote on border restrictions a condition, throwing a wrench in plans to approve the funding this week, the Washington Post reported.
* Moderna confirmed to Barron's that Covax, the global coalition backed by the World Health Organization and a major buyer of Covid-19 vaccine doses for low- and middle-income countries, turned down a chance to buy more doses for delivery in the third and fourth quarters of 2022.
* The Treasury Department proposed enabling families of insured workers who are paying more than 10% of income for healthcare coverage to receive financial help to buy Affordable Care Act coverage, starting Jan. 1, 2023. About 200,000 uninsured people could gain coverage, and nearly one million could see lower premiums.
What's Next: Former President Barack Obama joined President Joe Biden in calling for Congress to expand healthcare coverage to four million Americans in 12 states that haven't expanded Medicaid, let Medicare negotiate lower prescription drug prices, and make the subsidies in the American Rescue Plan permanent.

Amazon's Satellite Internet Service to Compete With SpaceX
Amazon.com plans to launch more than 3,000 small satellites into low orbit over the next five years, building a constellation that will beam high-speed internet service back to Earth in competition with Elon Musk's SpaceX.
* Amazon bought room on 83 rocket launches to take the satellites up, purchasing it from Blue Origin, which is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, as well as from United Launch Alliance, the joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and Arianespace, owned by Safran, Airbus, and others.
* Project Kuiper aims to bring broadband service to people in unserved and underserved communities around the world. Amazon invested more than $10 billion in it, second only to its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods Market in 2017. Bezos and Musk also compete in private space travel.
* Musk recently said SpaceX's Starlink internet service surpassed 250,000 subscribers, but that was before sending free base stations to Ukraine. Starlink's speeds can reach 200 megabits per second. Some Earth-based systems can reach 1 gigabit, or 1,000 megabits a second.
* Project Kuiper struck a deal last year with Verizon Communications that included providing satellite links to extend networks to rural and remote areas in the U.S. Starlink has a similar deal with a Japanese provider, The Wall Street Journal reported.
What's Next: SpaceX, valued at roughly $100 billion in private markets, plans to have 4,200 satellites active within 18 months, which would be two-thirds of all the active satellites orbiting the Earth, according to Musk.

Oil Company Execs Face Questions on Gas-Price Gouging
Exxon Mobil, Chevron, BP, and three other oil companies will face lawmakers this morning at the House Energy and Commerce Committee. They will have to answer questions about possible price gouging at the gasoline pump, where consumers are paying near record-high prices even as the oil companies reap big profit.
* Rep. Frank Pallone (D., N.J.), the committee chair, said in a prehearing memo that the companies represented at the hearing collectively generated more than $76 billion in profit in 2021, and paid shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks.
* Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D., N.Y.) of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform called on Shell, BP, Exxon, and Chevron to suspend stock buybacks and dividends and invest in proven clean energy sources. Gas prices reached $4.353 a gallon in March and are now $4.161, GasBuddy said.
* The Senate's Commerce Committee had a hearing on Tuesday about gasoline prices, where Robert McCullough, an energy consultant, raised the possibility of a ""windfall"" tax on oil companies, with credits for investing in production.
* Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, told the Senate committee that red tape by the Biden administration is putting a damper on new investment and development by the industry, and said the administration has engaged in regulatory overreach.
What's Next: Rising gasoline prices came after crude oil prices spiked to their highest level in nearly 14 years. Fuel prices generally ""lag on increases and decreases"" in the oil price by anywhere from two to four days before starting to move in the same direction, said GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan.

Dear Quentin,
My wife and I currently make $250,000 a year, which will climb north of $500,000 in the next few years. I have a currently unemployed sister and a brother who makes $40,000 annually with three kids. We are all in our early to mid-30s.
When thinking 10-30 years down the road, I am concerned with their lack of retirement savings, and inability to save for my niece and nephew's college fees. I'm particularly concerned with how our family gatherings will feel. Will the relative extravagance create jealousy or animosity? Will they feel better about our huge gap in income if I make an effort to help them?
Recently, my wife and I were talking about buying a $100,000 family SUV, while my brother was trying to buy a $5,000 car that needs mechanical work. I feel incredibly guilty that we will be well off, while our immediate family is struggling to make ends meet. However, I did work very hard to get where I am today as a physician.
The question I have for you: Is it a good idea to contribute to my sister/brother's retirement/529 accounts in an attempt to not only financially support them but to also encourage them to save money? My current plan is to ""match"" their contributions to a certain amount—sort of like an employer match—be it a retirement plan, or 529 college savings plan.
Are my feelings illogical? Should I get over my guilt? Or is this a sensible plan? I need an outside perspective.

68,6-Apr-22,Pittsburgh Post - Gazette,ELON MUSK'S TWITTER INVESTMENT COULD BE BAD NEWS FOR FREE SPEECH,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2647086600/BFD812D457A14912PQ/651?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk just bought a $3 billion stake in Twitter Inc., because when you're the world's richest human you can toss billions around like poker chips.This may be just another piece of performance art from Mr. Musk, who has alternately endorsed and pooh-poohed Bitcoin to great effect. He's also taken to Twitter to hype altcoins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, while simultaneously warning followers: ""Don't bet the farm on crypto!""
""True value is building products&providing services to your fellow human beings, not money in any form,"" he cautioned, which may be easy advice to give when your net worth is $273 billion, your electric vehicle company is surging and you can shoot your own rockets into space.
So maybe we should take Mr. Musk's Twitter investment as more of the same from the guy who has pondered the meaning of life while sipping whiskey and smoking weed during a podcast and once mysteriously claimed he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla Inc. private. But I suspect there's something more serious informing Mr. Musk's decision to invest in Twitter, even if he revels in buffoonery: Maybe he wants to bring Twitter to heel.
Consider the poll he conducted (on Twitter, of course) 10 days ago. ""Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy,"" it says. ""Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?"" More than 2 million users responded to that question, with 70.4% of them voting ""no.""
A day later, Mr. Musk, who fashions himself a ""free speech absolutist,"" was on the social media platform again: ""Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy. What should be done?"" This time he didn't bother with a poll, asking: ""Is a new platform needed?""
All of this follows Mr. Musk's ongoing battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has been monitoring his Twitter posts for a very good reason: They move markets. Mr. Musk maintained in a court filing that the SEC's oversight seems ""calculated to chill his exercise"" of free speech.
So despite ample room in which to exercise his speech - and aggressively trying to curtail the free speech of some of his critics - Mr. Musk evidently feels aggrieved. What's not clear is why Twitter is his target.
His Twitter rants and raves have been wide-ranging and unfettered. He once tweeted, then deleted, a meme comparing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Hitler. He's tweeted transphobic memes. He's slagged a British cave explorer as a ""pedo guy."" That's a lot of free speech, and Twitter hasn't done a lot to curtail it.
One explanation for Mr. Musk's sensitivity might be found in his libertarian leanings. Belated efforts by social media platforms to constrain some of the most virulent forms of political propaganda have raised the hackles of that crowd (along with far-rightists and Trumpistas). Now Mr. Musk has at least fired a shot across Twitter's bow by purchasing 9.2% of its stock - which is also much less expensive than doing the same to Facebook (a 9.2% stake in Meta Inc. would have cost him about $58 billion).
Does Mr. Musk want to take over Twitter? I don't think so. The company's financials aren't great, and running social media companies is hard. The car crash that is former President Donald Trump's social media experiment, Truth Social, is a cautionary tale for Mr. Musk. Does Mr. Musk want to name some people to Twitter's board of directors? Maybe. That would allow him to have some say over its affairs without spending too much time or money.
That's worrisome, because it's not ideal to have a free speech absolutist who isn't absolutely in favor of free speech at the helm of - or even close to - a media company. Mr. Musk has already received a nice pop on his Twitter stake. The shares jumped 26% on Monday after his investment was disclosed in a regulatory filing. He'll stick around longer, of course, and speculation that Twitter may be in play will further inflate his holdings.
But Mr. Musk probably isn't in this for the money. He's in it to make a point. And he's in it to scare Twitter's management. Somebody who has complained that his free speech is being ""chilled"" should, perhaps, be sensitive to those nuances. But that would assume that Mr. Musk is more of a philosopher than a bully.

69,7-Apr-22,Washington Examiner,Elon Musk is the first senator of Silicon Valley,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2648067131/BFD812D457A14912PQ/459?accountid=13946,"The answer to lousy regulation is not better regulation. It is less regulation because more regulation means worse regulation. Until recently, conservatives took this empirical fact as an article of faith. They also agreed with the classical liberal idea that the market was a better and fairer arbiter than partisan politicians or the permanent bureaucracy.
Today, however, statements of the Reaganite obvious are out of fashion. Instead, the Twitter Right is more likely to quote Carl Schmitt, the might-is-right theorist of state power in Nazi Germany, than Adam Smith, the “cuck” whose free market crack dream, it alleges, is the source of our woes of outsourcing and oligarchy. This confirms a second empirical fact: Never trust an intellectual. And it ignores a third: Elon Musk’s purchase of a significant stake in Twitter.
On April 4, Musk dropped $2.64 billion on a 9.2% stake in Twitter and a seat on its board. That makes him Twitter’s largest shareholder, with four times as many shares as its founder, Jack Dorsey. Twitter’s shares rose 29% overnight, but Musk won't settle for the dividends of a sleeping partnership. Just days earlier, he had telegraphed, as they used to say in the 19th century, his dissatisfaction with Twitter.
“Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy,” Musk tweeted a poll on March 26. “Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle? Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy. What should be done?”
Something must be done. Big Tech is the unacknowledged legislator of the public square. Its manipulations, all of which benefit Democrats and liberal activists, range from the sinister, suppressing discussion of Hunter Biden’s laptop and the origins of COVID-19, to the ridiculous, suspending the Babylon Bee’s satirical account because it gave Adm. Rachel Levine, who is neither a real sailor nor a biological woman, its Man of the Year award.
An inability to tolerate mockery is a vanity typical of the rich. In politics, it is a sign of incipient totalitarianism. Success only turned the libertarians of Big Tech into monopolists. Their love of clean, smooth surfaces might have turned Big Tech against the public — human beings do tend to gum up the wheels of technocracy. But it’s Big Tech’s struggle with the federal government that has turned it into a censor.
Musk also asked his followers, “Is a new platform needed?” The stifling of Parler and the fiasco of Gettr have already shown that Big Tech will brook no rivals from the Right, so I doubt Musk was crowdsourcing his decision to buy a stake in Twitter. He is far too smart for that. He knows that Silicon Valley’s alternative to expertise, the “wisdom of the crowd,” does not exist. It is in the nature of crowds to form around the lowest common denominator — hence the Twitter mob.
Rather, I suspect Musk was securing his followers’ support to legitimize what he would do anyway. This is what Mark Antony did over Julius Caesar’s body, and it’s what politicians always do. With this investment, Musk is making the Trump and AOC transition. He’s now a social media politician, at the head of his public.
This suggests a fourth empirical fact — or at least a fact in the making. The merger of Silicon Valley and the swamp is irreversible. The libertarian futurists of Silicon Valley have made a cold peace with the statist Franklin D. Roosevelt fans of the Democratic Party, but the peace will not hold. Silicon Valley sees itself as the successor to Washington, D.C., but Washington cannot rule without Silicon Valley’s tech. As the big welfare state that Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson, and Barack Obama built gets more and more expensive to run, the more the analog antique of the Washington bureaucracy needs digital economies of scale — and the more Silicon Valley reshapes the state in its digital image.
The populist Right is not wrong about Big Tech’s corruption of constitutional democracy. But its answer, raising the Left’s regulatory hammer in the name of the Right, if not righteousness, will intensify the problem. The populists’ authoritarian impulse replicates social media's thumbs-up/thumbs-down binaries. Completing the feedback loop with repressive legislation will only worsen the unconstitutional suppression of free speech.
Instead, Musk’s move into the market suggests an alternative solution. For, whatever Obama said, in this world, the arc of the amoral universe bends toward the money. The paradox is that the digital defense of free speech may also mean passing its protection into private hands. Musk, the world’s richest man, is now effectively the first senator for Silicon Valley. He won’t be the last.

70,7-Apr-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Musk Stirs Interest in Growth-Hungry Twitter,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2647535600/BFD812D457A14912PQ/569?accountid=13946,"Twitter Inc.'s move to add Elon Musk to its board gives the social-media company a new weapon to deploy in its hunt for user and revenue growth.
Twitter, after a fight with activist Elliott Management Corp., said a little over a year ago that it would work to at least double its revenue to $7.5 billion by the end of 2023 and reach at least 315 million monetizable daily active users at that time.
The company reached $5.08 billion in revenue at the end of last year, up 37% from the previous year. User numbers increased 13% to about 217 million daily users. If the company maintains this pace through the end of 2023, it would exceed its revenue target, though miss the mark for enlarging its user base.
""Musk, who clearly enjoys the platform with his sometimes controversial and always entertaining tweets, brings an air of excitement to the company,"" said analyst Daniel Newman of Futurum Research, an advisory business that focuses on digital technology. ""His larger role in the company could pave the way for more user growth and a likely better-than-average market performance as investors will be betting on his contributions to the company's next wave of growth.""
Mr. Musk, a longtime Twitter user now with more than 80 million followers, has demonstrated his tweets spur the kind of debate online that helps drive user engagement on social-media platforms and, with that, revenue.
The Tesla Inc. chief executive has sparked arguments on Twitter topics including his electric-car company and -- because he runs SpaceX -- planetary travel. His missives have moved markets and the price of the cryptocurrency bitcoin.
Twitter shares rose on the day Mr. Musk's investment became public and on the following day, when his board appointment was announced. The gains added roughly $10 billion in market value over the period, a sign of investor enthusiasm regarding the billionaire entrepreneur's role at the company. Twitter shares declined 0.4% Wednesday to $50.76.
Mr. Musk has long been heavily engaged on Twitter, at times bantering on the platform with founder Jack Dorsey. On Jan. 31, he began a weekslong Twitter-share buying spree that turned him from a regular user of the platform into the company's largest investor, with a stake of more than 9%. On Monday, Twitter appointed Mr. Musk to its board.
""We believe Musk's presence alone will help drive greater interest, and we view him as the most influential person attached to the company,"" Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, wrote in a note. ""Ultimately, the goal is to better monetize the platform, and we think Musk can only help, not hurt the process, with his recent criticism of the company as a refreshing sign.""
Over the past two years, Twitter has experimented with new features and products intended to fuel user engagement and more revenue, with mixed results.
In late 2020, the company launched Fleets, a feature that allowed users to post full-screen photos and videos that disappeared after a day, similar to the stories features available on rival services Instagram and Snapchat. The company shut down that feature in August 2021, saying ""we haven't seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped.""
Twitter had more success with a feature it began testing in December 2020 called Spaces, which let users congregate in audio-only rooms. The feature was successful enough in testing to be launched a few months later to Twitter users with more than 600 followers.
The company followed that with Twitter Blue, a paid version that offers subscribers exclusive features. Twitter rolled out the feature in June 2021 to users in Canada and Australia and opened the subscription service more broadly in the U.S. and New Zealand on Nov. 9. Among the features included in the $2.99 monthly service is the ability for subscribers to use nonfungible tokens they own as their Twitter profile pictures.
The addition of Mr. Musk to Twitter's board could spur further ""idea generation,"" Mr. Zino said. ""That's something that's much needed when you look at the Twitter platform. It's clearly lacked some innovation over the last several years.""
Twitter declined to comment.
There are also potential points of friction between Mr. Musk and Twitter, which in recent years stepped up its content moderation to address concerns that discourse on the platform had become a turnoff for some users. Mr. Musk, who has described himself as a ""free-speech absolutist,"" has raised questions about Twitter's approach to the issue. ""Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy. Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?"" he tweeted last month.
Some analysts said Mr. Musk could influence Twitter to ease up on content moderationor reinstate users, such as Donald Trump. The company banned the account of the then-president in January 2021, citing what it said was a risk of incitement to violence. That move drew sharp criticism from Mr. Trump and some of his supporters.
Such changes could spur user growth and engagement if more users come onto the service and more debates are sparked, but it could also scare away advertisers, said Ali Mogharabi, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.
""There have been some advertisers that favor content moderation,"" Mr. Mogharabi said. ""If there's more, as Musk put it, freedom of speech, then you could see some advertisers not necessarily pull out completely but just be a little bit more hesitant because they fear that their ads may be placed along with some bad content or conflicting content.""

There are 2,668 billionaires around the globe, according to Forbes' annual World's Billionaires list, down 87 from the previous year. These billionaires are worth a combined $12.7trillion.
Forbes cites the Russia-Ukraine war, the COVID pandemic and weaker markets for the dip in the number of billionaires.
The U.S. still tops all countries with the most billionaires at 735, followed by China's 607.
Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX founder, topped Forbes' list for the first time ever with a net worth of $219billion. More than half of the top 10 billionaires earned their fortunes in the technology sector.
Who are the top 10 richest people in the world?
1. Elon Musk ($219 billion). Musk recently joined Twitter's board after claiming a 9% stake in the company.
2. Jeff Bezos ($171 billion). He founded a little company called Amazon. He also has his own aerospace company, Blue Origin.
3. Bernard Arnault and family ($158 billion). Arnault runs LVMH, the company behind brands including Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, and Christian Dior.
4. Bill Gates ($129 billion). Gates co-founded software giant Microsoft.
5. Warren Buffett ($118 billion). The ""Oracle of Omaha"" is CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, and made his billions through investing.
6. Larry Page ($111 billion). Next time you Google anything, remember Page, who is one of its co-founders.
7. Sergey Brin ($107 billion). Brin co-founded Google with Page.
8. Larry Ellison ($106 billion). Ellison runs software giant Oracle.
9. Steve Ballmer ($91.4 billion). Ballmer once served as CEO of Microsoft. Today, he's owner of the Los Angeles Clippers.

So the news this week that Elon Musk plans to agitate for just such a long-neglected asset was heartening to anyone who has suffered the agony of a correctable error floating free in the Twitterverse. Musk's agitation now comes from a position of clout. On Monday, he disclosed that he has purchased 73,486,938 shares in the company, giving him a 9.2% ownership stake and making the Tesla CEO the largest outside shareholder at Twitter. And since Musk has an outsized following as an iconoclastic disrupter, that was enough to send Twitter shares up more than 25%.Musk, who has been one of the channel's most prolific users (he has some 80 million followers) and is known for his advocacy of free speech, now has a seat on the board of the company. And speculation is rife that he will make changes.We think there is a lot he could do.There is a growing sense that Americans are moving toward picking their social media channels based on their political allegiance. Former President Donald Trump, who was banned from Twitter, has been trying a launch a rival called Truth Social, although we're not surprised that the hype has eclipsed the practical details of a product yet to fully launch. A rival to YouTube and Facebook, known as Rumble, is being backed by the tech billionaire Peter Thiel and is selling itself as a place to post content that Mark Zuckerberg's censors would not allow.The issue, of course, is that while Twitter and Facebook long have billed themselves as politically neutral channels of user-generated content, that has proven impractical, given how one user's free expression of opinion is often another's propagation of misinformation. This reached a head at Twitter not just with Trump but with users such as the widely loathed (and widely read) vaccine skeptic and public health establishment critic Alex Berenson, who was de-platformed and took his many followers to Substack.Berenson's supporters tweeted this week that Berenson thinks Musk will find a way to get him back on Twitter. He may be right: Musk, known for his libertarian leanings, has suggested there will be ""significant"" changes.It's all a tough and complicated set of conflicting values for Musk to figure out and it's worth noting that he will not be the CEO (that's Parag Agrawal, who apparently had been talking to Musk for weeks, raising eyebrows at the Securities and Exchange Commission over the timing of Musk's purchase disclosure). By Musk's own account via tweets, he mused about founding his own version of Twitter only to decide that he would be better off taking a piece of the market leader. Smart.We're in favor of that edit button and also concerned that the union will not be served by half of America talking on one channel and the other half communicating on another while feeling dissed and repressed by the first. The country is fractured enough.If Musk can hold back the censoring bots and moralists, think all of these issues through, and come up with a way forward that encourages diversity of opinion and free expression without privileging conspiracy theories that threaten the democracy, he'll make Twitter better. Good luck to him.CAPTION: Photo: Elon Musk, with libertarian leanings, could make significant changes to Twitter. SUSAN WALSH/AP"
73,8-Apr-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Musk Presents Made-in-Texas E-Cars,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2647961511/BFD812D457A14912PQ/272?accountid=13946,"AUSTIN, Texas -- Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk delivered the company's first made-in-Texas vehicles on Thursday, saying the company was entering a new phase and teasing future products including a dedicated robotaxi.
The deliveries took place at a fete, dubbed the ""Cyber Rodeo,"" that marked the public unveiling of Tesla's new Austin-area auto-assembly plant. The company moved its headquarters to the Austin area last year from Palo Alto, Calif.
""We are really entering a new phase of Tesla's future,"" Mr. Musk said.
Mr. Musk took the stage around 9:30 p.m. local time in a black cowboy hat after a light show that illustrated, among other things, some of the company's vehicle designs in the evening sky. He arrived at the stage in a Tesla Roadster, the company's first production car.
The billionaire entrepreneur also gave a glimpse of Tesla's products to come. Among them, he said, a new Roadster, due to enter production next year, along with the long-delayed semitrailer truck. He gave no details about the robotaxi, beyond saying, ""It's going to look pretty futuristic.""
The Texas gathering's title borrows from the name of Tesla's long-awaited Cybertruck electric pickup, which, Mr. Musk said, would be built at the site starting next year.
The angular, futuristic truck is Tesla's entry into the emerging electric pickup truck segment, which auto makers are counting on to persuade more Americans to go electric. Gas-guzzling pickups make up roughly 18% of the U.S. auto market, according to J.D. Power, and are among car companies' more lucrative products. ""It's the bread and butter of the domestic auto makers,"" Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs said of pickup trucks.
Tesla's pickup was once scheduled to enter production last year. Mr. Musk suggested in January that the company was struggling to keep a lid on costs. ""You can make something infinitely desirable, but if it's not affordable, that will constrain people's ability to buy it,"" he told analysts. On Thursday, he apologized for the delays.
Rivian Automotive Inc. was the first to market with an electric pickup truck. Customer deliveries of its R1T started last year. General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. also have battery-powered pickups in the works.
The Cyber Rodeo was designed to host as many as 15,000 people, according to the Travis County fire marshal. The party kicked off Thursday afternoon inside Tesla's factory, where electronic music blared and displays introduced visitors to Tesla's manufacturing.
Some people rode a mechanical bull stationed near the center of the entrance, as women dressed in silver Spandex and cowboy hats glided across the concrete floor on roller skates.
Tesla Model Ys, with long horns affixed to their hoods, were positioned to shuttle people around the parking lot.
Mr. Musk said it was the largest factory in the world, with a size equivalent to three Pentagons.
""We needed a place where we could be really big, and there's no place like Texas,"" he said.

74,8-Apr-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Petition Asks for F.T.C. Inquiry Into Gun Marketing: [Business/Financial Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2647945857/BFD812D457A14912PQ/418?accountid=13946,"Gun control advocates are petitioning the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the firearms industry's marketing practices.Illusion of safety?Gun control advocates are petitioning the Federal Trade Commission today to investigate and regulate the firearms industry as it has with tobacco, alleging that gun manufacturers use deceptive advertising practices.The petition, which DealBook is first to report, is the latest salvo aimed at the marketing tactics of an industry that has largely been protected from liability for the harms of its products because of federal laws. The groups urging action by the F.T.C. include Brady, the Giffords Law Center, March for Our Lives and the FACT Coalition.Gun marketing promotes an illusion of safety, the petitioners say. Americans have ""been falsely led to believe that gun ownership is a safe way to protect their home and family,"" they argue. The C.D.C. reported 45,222 deaths from gun-related injuries in 2020 (an earlier version of this item misstated the year, because of an editing error). The F.T.C. ""has effectively given the gun industry a free pass,"" the petitioners say.Advocates have asked the F.T.C. to investigate the gun industry before, starting in 1996. The F.T.C. can choose to address or ignore this latest petition, which comes as the Biden administration has expressed support for more transparency on gun manufacturers' operations and state-level lawsuits have begun to break through the industry's barriers to litigation.In February, the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims settled a suit for $73 million against Remington that alleged the gun maker's aggressive marketing violated Connecticut law by promoting firearms to troubled men like the one responsible for the massacre. The settlement opens internal company documents to scrutiny, which would offer a rare view into how gun makers like Remington develop their marketing messages. President Biden described it as a step in ""holding gun manufacturers accountable for manufacturing weapons of war and irresponsibly marketing these firearms.""Last year, a New Jersey judge ruled in favor of the state's attorney general in a lawsuit against Smith & Wesson for its advertising practices, requiring the company to release internal documents. The ruling was recently overturned, leaving the state's lawsuit intact but the release of documents uncertain. Smith & Wesson said in a filing that the suit sought to ""suppress and punish lawful speech regarding gun ownership in order to advance an anti-Second Amendment agenda.""The F.T.C.'s enforcement of federal consumer protection law could look to these state precedents, like the Connecticut consumer law that allowed the Sandy Hook families to sue. ""If a company violates the consumer protection laws with false advertisements, that is not protected activity,"" said David Pucino of the Giffords Law Center. ""They are breaking the law.""HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENINGShell will take a hit of up to $5 billion by pulling out of Russia. This morning the British oil giant detailed the size of the write-off resulting from its exit from joint ventures with Gazprom and other activities in Russia. It's big, but high energy prices are expected to bolster Shell's bottom line this year, with analysts forecasting it to make over $30 billion in 2022.Treasury secretary Janet Yellen talks crypto. Today, in her first speech focusing on digital asset regulation, she will call for ""a consistent and comprehensive policy framework that promotes responsible innovation of digital assets and appropriately assesses and mitigates the risks they may pose,"" backing up President Biden's recent executive order on crypto.Central bankers are backing higher interest rates. The minutes from the Fed's March meeting said that ""many"" officials would have preferred a bigger rate increase than the quarter-point rise they settled on, but held off because of concerns over the impact of the war in Ukraine. Markets now expect the Fed to make half-point increases in May and possibly June.Corporate bankruptcy filings are at their lowest levels in over a decade. Only 87 U.S. businesses filed for bankruptcy in the first quarter of the year, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, the lowest first-quarter total in at least 13 years. Companies have benefited from pandemic stimulus programs and cheap funding, but rising interest rates may put balance sheets under more pressure in the quarters ahead.Fanatics raises $1.5 billion in fresh funds. The round, which values the rapidly growing sports merchandise company at $27 billion, included investments from several leagues, like the N.F.L. and M.L.B., as well as players associations and team owners.Insuring Elon MuskTwitter's investors appear convinced that Elon Musk can make the social media company better. The company's stock is up 30 percent since the news broke that Musk had bought a large stake in Twitter and would join its board. That has added some $9 billion to the company's market value. But when Musk becomes a director at Twitter, he may also bring some costs.What will happen to Twitter's insurance premiums? Most public companies carry policies that shield directors and officers from personal liability, known as D&O insurance. Musk's past legal run-ins include a settlement with the S.E.C. over a market-moving tweet about Tesla (which Musk is trying to scrap) and a defamation lawsuit by a British cave explorer, whom Musk called a ""pedo guy"" in a tweet (which Musk won). In buying his Twitter stake, Musk appears to have filed the required disclosures late and may have initially used the wrong type of form. ""I would be very concerned if I was the insurance company asked to underwrite and provide it,"" Peter Taffae, a managing partner of the D&O insurance brokerage Executive Perils, told DealBook.Tesla has faced high premiums in the past because of Musk. After Musk settled with the S.E.C., Tesla said in a regulatory filing that insurers were asking for ""disproportionately high premiums"" for D&O insurance. Instead, Musk briefly insured the company himself. Tesla paid him $3 million for a three-month term before it signed a new policy with ""third-party carriers.""Twitter has had its own issues. Last year, the company reached an $800 million settlement with shareholders in a lawsuit that claimed Twitter had inflated its user numbers.

Days before, workers at an Amazon warehouse on Staten Island voted to form a union, the first in the U.S. at the e-commerce giant. (The White House later said that the president was merely expressing general support for unions.) Meanwhile, the success of the independent, crowd-funded union drive at Amazon has traditional labor unions rethinking their tactics .Pay daysMany public companies in the U.S. are approaching the deadline to file their annual proxy statements, which among other things detail how much top executives were paid in the prior year.

75,9-Apr-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Musk Says Tesla Will Sell Its Cybertruck Next Year: [Business/Financial Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2648313809/BFD812D457A14912PQ/21?accountid=13946,"Delays in producing the pickup have allowed rivals like Ford to beat Tesla to market with electric pickups.Tesla will begin producing its much-delayed electric pickup, the Cybertruck, next year along with numerous other new products, Elon Musk, the carmaker's chief executive, said late Thursday.The truck, with an angular design and a stainless-steel skin that set it apart from traditional pickups, has been delayed after an inauspicious unveiling in 2019, when a designer lobbed a metal ball at a window in what was supposed to be a demonstration of the vehicle's toughness.Instead, the window cracked.""We're going to smash the window again,"" Mr. Musk joked on Thursday as a Cybertruck rolled onstage at a lavish ""Cyber Rodeo"" organized by Tesla in Austin, Texas, to show off its new factory near the state capital.""We can't wait to build this here,"" Mr. Musk, wearing a black cowboy hat, said of the truck. ""Sorry for the delay. But you're going to have this next year, and it's really going to be great.""Tesla's chief executive has a long history of promising products that materialize later than he said they would or not at all, but his timeline for the Cybertruck is more definite than the one he gave to investors in January, when he said delivery in 2023 was ""most likely.""Delays in producing the Cybertruck have allowed rivals to come to market sooner with pickups, one of the most popular types of vehicle in the United States. Ford Motor is expected to begin delivering the Lightning, a battery-powered version of its F-150, this summer. Rivian's electric pickup went on sale late last year to rave reviews, but the company has had trouble ramping up production, a common problem for new car companies.Tesla invited about 15,000 people to the Cyber Rodeo, which Mr. Musk, with his customary hyperbole, billed as the ""biggest party on earth."" The factory is as large as three Pentagons, he said.Local schools closed early so parents could avoid traffic jams caused by those flocking to the event, the television station KXAN reported. The actor Harrison Ford was among the guests. Tesla parked red, white and blue cars in formation to look like the Texas state flag.The factory is part of a global expansion by Tesla that includes a newly opened plant near Berlin. Along with an existing factory in Shanghai, the new assembly lines could help the company repeat its growth in 2021, when it nearly doubled sales to almost one million vehicles, far outpacing other major carmakers.""This year is all about scaling up,"" Mr. Musk said. ""Next year, there is going to be a massive wave of new products.""In 2023, Tesla will also produce a roadster, a semi-truck and ""hopefully"" the first version of a humanoid robot called Optimus, which, Mr. Musk said, will do ""anything that humans won't want to do."" He added that a beta version of full self-driving software would be available to North American customers this year.PhotographTesla's Cybertruck has been delayed after an inauspicious unveiling in 2019.

76,11-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla Needs Lithium. Elon Musk Suggests It Might Get Into the Mining Business.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2648906586/BFD812D457A14912PQ/74?accountid=13946,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk lamented the rising cost of lithium in a recent tweet. He even suggested that Tesla might get into the mining business to help solve shortages of the key raw material that goes into rechargeable lithium-ion electric vehicle batteries.
Tesla-as-miner has far reaching implications for the EV industry. Will locking up long-term lithium supply become a strategic imperative for the industry? Will other auto companies look to backward integrate into the EV battery supply chain ? Those are longer term questions for investors to ponder. More immediately, lithium mining stocks—most likely the smaller ones—could react wildly in Monday trading.
The larger, more established, players include Albemarle (ticker: ALB), Livent (LTHM) and SQM (SQM). (Livent still qualifies as a small capitalization stock.)
Three smaller players include Piedmont Lithium (PLL), Lithium Americas (LAC) and Sigma Lithium (SGML.Canada).
So far, the market isn't doing all that much with Musk's tweet. Albemarle and SQM shares are down about 1.2% and 2.8%, respectively. Maybe investors see a little more competition for growth. Three of the four smaller capitalization stocks are up, however. Livent shares are up a little. Sigma shares are up as well, by about 0.8%. Lithium Americas stock is up about 1.3%,. Piedmont shares are off 1.1%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are down about 0.8% and 0.1%, respectively.
The two largest players have a combined market capitalization of almost $50 billion. The four smaller players have a combined market cap of about $11 billion.
""Price price of lithium has gone to insane levels!"" tweeted Musk on April 8.
He has a point. Benchmark lithium prices are at about $78,000 a metric ton, up almost 80% year-to-date. The price for a basket of battery materials Barron's tracks is up about 60% year-to-date, theoretically adding roughly $2,000 to the price of an EV.
Most battery materials, however, are bought on a contract basis. Most commodity prices quoted are spot prices. When spot is greater than contract, it is a sign that contract prices will move higher.
""Tesla might have to get into the mining [and ] refining directly at scale,"" said Musk, adding in a later tweet ""we have some cool ideas for sustainable lithium extraction [and] refinement.""
Scale doesn't appear to be the big issue. There are large miners such as Albemarle that produce lithium for well less than $10,000 a metric ton, according to company documents and Barron's calculations. What's more, everyone in the lithium industry is investing for growth. Wall Street expects Albemarle's capital spending to be about $1.4 billion in 2022, more than double levels from just a few years ago.
Current spot prices are good enough for miners to put capital into the ground. Instead, the issues appear to be EV demand growth, which is happening faster than people, and the time it takes for the mining industry to ramp up new capacity.
Lithium miners, it seems, are a little behind the growth curve.
Tesla (TSLA) has already taken steps into the industry, working with Piedmont. Tesla agreed to take production from the start-up back in 2020 . That deal sent Piedmont stock up more than 230% the day it was announced.
Still, in that deal, Piedmont will be doing the mining. Musk is probably happy to take that company's lithium. He just wants more.
Coming into Monday trading, shares of the three lithium companies with start-up projects are up about 33% year-to-date on average, propelled by higher commodity costs. All three stocks fell on Friday along with the S&P 500.
Shares in the three more established miners—Albemarle, SQM and Livent—are up about 20% year to date on average. All three of those shares dropped on Friday as well.

77,11-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk Says He Remains Engaged in Twitter Strategy 'Without Limitation' After Refusing Board Seat; Tesla CEO says he might discuss product and services, potential mergers and governance, among other issues, with board or management",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2648893486/BFD812D457A14912PQ/201?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk confirmed he wouldn't be joining Twitter Inc.'s board of directors but said he might engage with the social-media company on a range of issues ""without limitation.""
Mr. Musk might discuss with Twitter's board or parts of its management team the company's product and services, potential mergers and governance issues, he said in an amended regulatory filing Monday. The Tesla Inc. chief executive can express his views about Twitter on social media or speak directly with executives and board members, the filing states.
Mr. Musk last week disclosed a roughly 9% stake in Twitter, making him the company's largest shareholder. His filing said he owns the stake for investment purposes and that he might acquire more shares or sell his current holdings in the company.
The electric-vehicle chief's decision not to join Twitter's board marked a reversal that cast new uncertainty over his relationship with the social-media platform. He spent much of the weekend tweeting criticisms , suggestions and apparent jokes about the company, many of which he has since deleted.
Monday's filing states Mr. Musk doesn't currently have any plans or intentions to change his holdings in the company, but it notes that he ""reserves the right to change his plans at any time, as he deems appropriate, and in light of his ongoing evaluation of numerous factors.""
Those factors include market and economic conditions, Twitter's business and financial conditions, Mr. Musk's need for liquidity, the attractiveness of other investment opportunities and other possible developments, according to the filing.
Mr. Musk originally disclosed his stake in the company through a Schedule 13G filing, which suggested it was a passive stake and that he didn't intend to influence the operations of the business. The filing has since been amended to a Schedule 13D, which is often used by activist investors whose plans include pushing for a merger or otherwise seeking to control a company.
In a tweet Sunday night, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal didn't provide a reason for Mr. Musk's decision not to join the board.
""I believe this is for the best,"" he said. ""We have and will always value input from our shareholders whether they are on our Board or not. Elon is our biggest shareholder and we will remain open to his input.""
Analysts pondered what Mr. Musk's move means for his future role with Twitter. His board term was originally set for two years, and as long as he remained a director, he couldn't own more than 14.9% of the company's stock, according to a securities filing. Without a board seat, he could potentially build an even bigger stake if he wanted to do so.

78,11-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),"Elon Musk Won't Join Twitter's Board, After All. What It Means for the Stock.",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2648822574/BFD812D457A14912PQ/524?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk will no longer join the board of Twitter, just days after the company announced his appointment.
The rapid U-turn was quickly reflected in the share price movement as the social-media company's stock fell more than 4% in premarket trading Monday.
Investors hoping that Musk's influence at a board level would bring about change were clearly disappointed. But it's far from the end of the story. Musk remains Twitter's largest shareholder after taking a 9.2% stake, and he hasn't been shy when it comes to raising potential changes to the platform, even if some have been on the jokey side.
But his sudden decision, announced by Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and, oddly, not by the man himself, does cast doubt on where the billionaire's journey with the social-media giant will end up. Agrawal stated the board appointment was contingent on a background check and ""formal acceptance,"" adding that Musk informed the company on Saturday he would no longer be joining the board.
As for Musk, his intentions have never been that clear, although a poll on removing the edit button and posts about free speech have offered clues.
But the stock, which surged 27% on its best ever day last week , is still around 13% higher than it was before Musk disclosed his stake, even factoring in Monday's early fall.
Regardless of his next move, or the level of influence he might have, the Tesla CEO's very presence as Twitter's largest shareholder will keep management on its toes. Investors want the company's financial results to be in line with the chirpiness of its leading shareholder.

Musk Won't Join Twitter Board, but Shares Ideas Anyway
Musk won't be joining Twitter's board, but its biggest shareholder has been tossing out ideas about the social-media platform, including giving out authentication check marks to TwitterBlue subscribers. And his more than 81 million followers are listening.
* Some of his cheekier ideas are showing up on Musk's own Twitter account. He's taking a poll asking whether to delete the ""w"" in the word Twitter, and as of 11:45 p.m. Sunday, 51% have voted yes, while 49% have voted ""of course."" Those were the only options.
* He also put out a poll asking whether to convert Twitter's San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter ""since no one shows up anyway."" So far, the yes vote has 91.3%, and the no vote has 8.7%.
* Musk proposed giving authentication check marks to everyone who signs up for Twitter Blue, a monthly subscription that offers premium features and the ability to customize an individual's experience. They would be different from the check marks for verified accounts or public figures.
* Musk also agreed with a user who suggested subscriptions should be cheaper in less affluent countries, saying the cost ""should be proportionate to affordability,"" Axios reported. ""Maybe even an option to pay in Doge?"" he mused, referring to the Dogecoin cryptocurrency.
What's Next: Late Sunday, Agrawal tweeted that Musk told the company on Saturday he wouldn't be joining the board. ""I believe this is for the best,"" Agrawal said, adding the company remains open to Musk's input as its biggest shareholder.

Biden Meeting With India's Modi About Russia's War Impact
President Joe Biden will meet virtually today with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose government has been neutral on Russia's invasion of Ukraine, to discuss the consequences of Russia's war and its ""destabilizing impact on global food supply and commodity markets,"" the White House said.
* Russian Gen. Aleksandr Dvornikov was named to run operations in Ukraine, but that won't erase Russia's record there, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN Sunday. ""This general will just be another author of crimes and brutality against Ukrainian civilians.""
* Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba told NBC that the U.S. has provided heavy air-defense systems and is helping Ukraine get additional weapons from other countries. ""You provide us with everything that we need, and we fight so that you don't have to.""
* Sullivan said he and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley spent two hours on the phone with the Ukrainian Armed Forces chief making plans to deliver all the weapons Ukraine wants to strengthen Ukraine's position on the battlefield and at the bargaining table.
* U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Kyiv over the weekend and talked to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Sullivan told NBC that Biden isn't currently planning a trip there.
What's Next: Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said that Finland's Parliament will discuss possible NATO membership ""within the coming weeks"" with talks that could wrap up ""before midsummer."" Finland shares an 800-mile border with Russia.

Macron, Le Pen to Go Head-to-Head in French Election
In the first round of France's presidential election, President Emmanuel Macron and far-right politician Marine Le Pen led the field, according to widely reported projections.
* Macron achieved an estimated 28.2% of the vote while Le Pen came in with a projected 22.9%, The Wall Street Journal reported, which means they will go head-to head on April 24 in the final round.
* ""Nothing was decided"" Macron said after Sunday's first round of elections, Agence France-Presse reported, with the president adding that the next two weeks would be ""decisive for our country and Europe.""
* On Monday Paris' CAC 40 outperformed other indexes in the region—moving 0.4% higher—as Macron showed a greater lead over Le Pen than polls had suggested.
What's Next: The next two weeks will be key, with the debate focused on France's cost-of-living crisis and immigration. The Journal reported that far-right former TV pundit Éric Zemmour, who won 7.3% of the estimated vote, has encouraged his supporters to back Le Pen.

Airlines Curb Flights Ahead of Summer Travel Surge
Airlines are trimming flight schedules as they hire more workers, aiming to avoid the headaches of last summer's travel rebound. To prepare for the travel surge, carriers hired more pilots, flight attendants, gate agents, ramp workers, and customer-service representatives, The Wall Street Journal reported.
* JetBlue, which grappled with another weekend of flight delays and cancellations, told workers it will cut capacity 8% to 10% in May and by similar levels through the summer even as it braces for a wave of travel demand.
* While JetBlue has hired 3,000 more workers, it is still short-staffed. It is competing with Frontier to buy Spirit Airlines. ""Based on your feedback that the schedule is wound too tight, we know the best plan is to reduce capacity now,"" JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty told staff.
* American Airlines hired more than 600 pilots and is focused on supply-chain issues such as catering. Alaska Air Group, Delta Air Lines, and American pilots have picketed in recent weeks, complaining about flight schedules leaving pilots overworked and fatigued, the Journal reported.
* Storms in Florida earlier in April forced flight attendants to wait hours for transportation and hotels, and some slept in airports, unions that represent American and Southwest Airlines flight attendants said. Southwest said it is working to improve its contingency planning.
What's Next: JetBlue is offering $1,000 bonuses to flight attendants who don't call out of work through May 31 and an extra $100 a trip for working on their days off. Southwest raised starting pay to $17 an hour and waived requirements that workers have high school diplomas.

Bank Earnings Expected to Reveal Effects of Market Volatility
Bank earnings are due for the volatile first quarter, when Russia's war on Ukraine began and threw markets and the financial businesses associated with them into disarray. Some banks have already detailed exposure to Russian assets held, but the fallout will likely extend to revenue from deal making and trading.
* Big banks are leaving Russia and face losses. Goldman Sachs' credit exposure there was $650 million at the end of 2021, and JPMorgan has said exiting Russia could cost it $1 billion. Citigroup could lose $4 billion.
* Equity capital markets, a business that includes initial public offerings, is expected to be weak. Dealogic says revenue is down 75% from the same period last year and 61% from the quarter ending in December. Merger volumes have fallen by one-third the robust level of last year.
* Stock trading results could also be blunted, but commodities and currency trading may help offset that. The price of U.S. benchmark crude oil is up 30% so far this year.
* JPMorgan kicks off the week on Wednesday, with expected earnings per share of $2.72, while Goldman and Wells Fargo among others come Thursday, with EPS expected to be $8.95 and 82 cents, respectively.
What's Next: Banks benefit when interest rates rise because they can charge more interest on loans without immediately raising the rates they pay on deposits. The Federal Reserve's meeting in May, when many expect it to bump up rates a half-point, could be a catalyst for bank stocks.

 Elon Musk Won't Join Twitter's Board, After All. What It Means for the Stock. 
"
79,11-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Social Media May Have to Embrace the Musk; Elon Musk apparently won't be joining Twitter's board, but some of his ideas have a future in social media",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2648911877/BFD812D457A14912PQ/526?accountid=13946,"Social media might be moving beyond its historical underpinnings in ad dollars. The past week has given investors two very different illustrations of how that might play out.
To think of social media as strictly an advertising business is to appreciate only its outer candy shell. Future social-media investors will need to decide whether what lies inside can taste just as sweet.
Advertising will remain the principal monetization driver at Twitter, Meta Platforms and other social-media companies for some time. This in turn means efforts to moderate content—and the balancing act that requires with irate users, even rich and powerful ones—will go on. But moves to diversify beyond ads are in motion already.
Twitter's future as a predominantly ad-based business came into question last week after Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk disclosed he had become the company's largest shareholder . He recently polled his followers for their views on a Twitter edit button and the platform's adherence to free-speech principles. He mocked the company in a series of since-deleted tweets over the weekend , suggesting it remove the ""w"" from its name and turn its headquarters into a homeless shelter.
Some of his other, now-deleted weekend tweets were more constructive, and point to a possible future path that would reduce the company's dependence on advertising. In one, he said that Twitter Blue, the platform's relatively new paid-subscription service, should remove all ads and offer other sought-after features like an authentication check mark.
Mr. Musk also said over the weekend that he wouldn't join Twitter's board of directors, just days after accepting a seat. But he could have a greater impact as an outside agitator, especially since not joining the board means removing the limit to how much of the company's stock he can accumulate.
It isn't clear exactly how ads—which historically have run alongside a platform's walled garden of content, subject to clearly outlined rules—can coexist with less moderation. Advertisers like to know what kind of content they will be running ads next to. A move toward an ""open source"" algorithm—as Mr. Musk has also hinted at—would likely take away much of Twitter's centralized control over the conversation, making it much harder to appease advertisers.
Nonetheless, look for Twitter to lean in to subscription: The company, which last year generated about $5 billion in ad revenue, could conceivably generate half of that sum by charging less than 5% of its ""monetizable daily active users"" less than $20 a month for access to exclusive features or fewer ads. If that seems far-fetched, consider that Mr. Musk just spent billions of dollars in an attempt to make Twitter work his way.
Meanwhile, in the metaverse, Facebook parent Meta Platforms isn't just trying to build a three-dimensional place for users to socialize ; it is trying to create a virtual shopping mall. Your friends might get you there, but the goods will encourage you to stay.
Meta has for years been talking about building up commerce applications to complement its advertising cornerstone. It has already begun to do so, launching catalog and shopping features across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.
But currency has been another priority for the social-media giant. The company is exploring the introduction of coins, tokens and lending services across its apps, the Financial Times reported last week. In a statement, Meta said it is focused on building for the metaverse ""and that includes what payments and financial services might look like.""
Any initial stab at a Meta currency could look less like a blockchain cryptocurrency—recall Meta's previous attempt at cryptocurrency , Project Libra, failed to take flight—and more like what gaming platform Roblox has employed with its ""Robux.""
Gamifying Meta could mean adding coins for its users to exchange for new avatar features in the metaverse, reading pay-walled content, buying nonfungible tokens or rewarding creators for posts. Digital coins on Meta could be earned rather than purchased to start: Users could accumulate coins for minutes spent on Meta's apps or for the amount of content consumed.
In that sense, Meta would be paying to get users to spend more time in its ecosystem, hoping that would lead users themselves to spend more money there. More time spent, of course, would also make its platforms more compelling to advertisers—which is why it could be a mistake to judge Meta's future potential solely by its dwindling revenue growth today.
Twitter's stock is up nearly 13% over the last three months, while Meta's is down over 35%, suggesting investors might be less excited about a whole new business model for social media than they are for a new look. But with moves away from ads now well in train, investors need to start considering what future business models could look like, and which players have the right formula for success.

 Social Media May Have to Embrace the Musk

80,12-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk's Twitter Stake Is Forcing Tesla Investors to Consider the Key-Man Risk,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2649180671/BFD812D457A14912PQ/91?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO and Twitter's largest shareholder.

The on again, off again dalliance between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Twitter's board of directors is generating some volatility for Twitter stock and questions for Tesla investors.
Musk wouldn't be a board member after all, even though he is Twitter's largest shareholder. The billionaire entrepreneur was supposed to join the board on Saturday; the social media start-up disclosed the turnabout on Monday.
And the stock reacted to the news, tweeted by Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal. Shares of Twitter (ticker: TWTR) traded as low as $44.71 before closing up 1.7% at $47.01. The intraday peak-to-trough move was more than 7% of the Friday closing price.
Since Musk disclosed his roughly 9% stake a week ago, Twitter shares are up about 20%. In the same period, Tesla shares are down about 10%. Now, to be fair, the market has been weak. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are off about 3% and 6%, respectively.
Still, Tesla investors might wonder if Musk's involvement could affect his ability to do his day job running the most valuable car company on the planet.
That possibility, known as the key-man risk, has always existed with Tesla, but Wall Street experts like Gerber Kawasaki CEO Ross Gerber and Roth analyst Craig Irwin don't see all that much reason for additional concern.
Gerber, a bullish Tesla investor, told Barron's that he would like to see Tesla develop a ""deeper bench"" of management talent, but doesn't believe Musk is focused on that right now. Tesla is the largest holding in Gerber's ETF, Gerber Kawasaki AdvisorShares (GK), at more than 11% of the portfolio.
Musk has his plate full, ramping up two new plants—one in Berlin and one in Austin, Texas—and working on Tesla's self-driving software. He is even developing a robot to do the mundane manufacturing tasks that humans now handle.
 Irwin looks at the question of the key-man risk another way. Of course, there are catastrophic outcomes that no one can rule out completely, but ""Tesla is Elon Musk,"" said Irwin, likening his impact to that of Steve Jobs at Apple (AAPL) decades ago. ""He will be the most important person at Tesla for the next 20 years,"" he added.
Musk is 50, turning 51 in June. Irwin doesn't see Musk leaving for Twitter or being overly distracted by his investment.
Nonetheless, the analyst is cautious in his assessment of Tesla. He rates shares Hold, but has a low $250 price target. Tesla closed at $975.73 on Monday. Irwin believes Tesla should be one of the most valuable auto makers around, just not one of the most valuable companies in the market.
Tesla is the fifth most valuable company in the S&P 500 and worth roughly 3.5 times more than Toyota Motor (TM), the second most valuable car maker in the world.
The Musk-Twitter impact on Tesla stock looks likely to fade. Tesla investors, after all, are used to Musk's tweets and Musk doing other things—such as running his spacecraft company, SpaceX, with President Gwynne Shotwell.
Shotwell is a well-respected executive in the aerospace industry. Investors may want to see the emergence of her counterpart at Tesla in coming years.

81,12-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),"A Lesson About Wealth From Elon Musk, the World's Richest Human",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2649314815/BFD812D457A14912PQ/497?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk is worth a cool $274 billion. Now, a former auto analyst-turned-market researcher has broken down the number to show how the Tesla CEO amassed such a mind-boggling fortune—and drives home the point that the huge number is really no huge surprise.
Musk stepped off on his path to enormous wealth 20 years ago when eBay, the e-commerce platform, bought the fintech PayPal, which he co-founded with a host of other notables, including financier Peter Thiel.
""In 2002 Elon Musk got $176 million when PayPal sold to eBay,"" writes Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research . ""He reinvested much of that into Tesla, SpaceX, and other startups. Now, he is worth $274 billion.""
The entrepreneur, in 20 years, has quadrupled that chunk of change almost 400 times—a near-unimaginable 1,557 times, which works out to an average annual return of about 42%.
""While obviously better than the S&P 500's compounded return of [about 9%], it is still within the bounds of reason,"" added Colas.
Earning 42% a year on his investments, the 50-year-old Musk is about four years from being a trillionaire. Right now, no one wears that crown. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has $127 billion, according to Forbes, and is 91, four decades older than Musk.
The point that Colas makes about compounding returns is a good one for everyday folks to remember: The best way to build wealth through stocks is to hang on to them. Perhaps the best—and safest way—is a low-cost, well-diversified mutual fund.
Now, finding 40% returns like Musk, though, would be extraordinary. The Nasdaq Composite has averaged about 12% a year for the past two decades. Still, the 3 percentage-point difference between the Nasdaq and the S&P over 20 years amounts to 70% more wealth for investors picking the Nasdaq. Compound returns really do compound over time .
As for Musk, his $274 billion—or Buffett's empire or any of the mega-cash piles that others are sitting on—stirs up envy and speculation about taxes and risk-taking.
And, of course, jokes about the uber rich abound. One of Barron's favorites: ""How do you become a millionaire? Start as a billionaire and buy an airline.""
When reflecting on his experience with airlines, Buffett wrote in 2007 ""if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.""
That one always gets us.

 A Lesson About Wealth From Elon Musk, the World's Richest Human

82,13-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk Is Sued for Delayed Disclosure of Twitter Stake; Lawsuit alleges billionaire saved $143 million by delaying the filing, while hurting shareholders who sold stock before his position was publicized",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2649657883/BFD812D457A14912PQ/354?accountid=13946,"A Twitter Inc. shareholder sued Elon Musk, alleging the billionaire committed securities fraud by delaying the disclosure of his stake in the social-media company.
In the lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on Tuesday, Marc Bain Rasella alleges that Mr. Musk didn't properly disclose his Twitter stake within the required time frame. The suit alleges that the move personally benefited Mr. Musk and could have hurt other shareholders who sold the stock.
Mr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc., on April 4 disclosed owning almost 73.5 million shares of Twitter as of March 14. That gave him a 9.2% stake, making him the company's largest shareholder . Tesla and a representative for Mr. Musk didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Investors whose holdings in a company surpass 5% are required to report their stake within 10 calendar days. These filings can send companies' shares higher as investors anticipate changes spurred by the large shareholder, such as a company sale, stock buyback or new board members.
The lawsuit alleges that Mr. Musk should have filed the disclosure form by March 24. Twitter investors who sold their shares between March 24 and before Mr. Musk's stake was disclosed April 4 ""missed the resulting share price increase as the market reacted to Musk's purchases and were damaged thereby,"" according to the suit.
By delaying the filing, Mr. Musk saved about $143 million on buying Twitter stock, the lawsuit alleges. Mr. Musk is the world's richest person with a net worth of $251 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Mr. Rasella, the plaintiff, sold Twitter shares at depressed prices during the period and was damaged by Mr. Musk's material omissions and misrepresentations, the lawsuit alleges. Twitter shares surged 27% the day Mr. Musk disclosed his position, the company's largest one-day rally on record. Mr. Rasella filed the suit for himself and on behalf of others similarly situated.
The SEC has previously brought enforcement actions against people who continued to miss these types of deadlines. Lawyers have said Mr. Musk's disclosure issues could hurt the Tesla leader in his legal tussling with the SEC.
Mr. Musk recently asked a federal judge to kill a fraud settlement he reached in 2018 with securities regulators that mandates some of his tweets related to Tesla be preapproved by company lawyers.
Mr. Musk is known for his use of Twitter, where he has polled users on whether he should sell some of his Tesla stock and questioned whether the social-media platform itself was dying.
Plans for Mr. Musk to join Twitter's board were announced April 5, a day after he disclosed his stake in the company, but were scrapped just days later .

83,13-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Sued by Investor for Delay in Disclosing His Twitter Stake,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2649491817/BFD812D457A14912PQ/499?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has been sued by a Twitter shareholder who alleges the Tesla CEO delayed disclosing his stake in the social media company so he could buy more shares at lower prices.
The suit, filed in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday, claimed Musk violated securities laws by not revealing by March 24 that he had accumulated a stake of at least 5% in Twitter (ticker: TWTR). The lawsuit alleges that by March 14, Musk's stake in Twitter had reached 5%, which required him to publicly disclose his stake 10 days later by March 24. Musk didn't file the required disclosure with the Securities and Exchange Commission until April 4, after he had boosted his position to more than 9% .
Twitter shareholder Marc Bain Rasella filed the lawsuit against Musk. He is seeking to have the lawsuit certified as a class action for shareholders who sold Twitter stock between March 24 and April 1.
Rasella said that when Musk filed the form that disclosed his Twitter position, the stock soared 27% from its April 1 close to $49.97 on April 4, and investors ""missed the resulting share price increase as the market reacted to Musk's purchases,"" the lawsuit alleged.
""By failing to timely disclose his ownership stake, Musk was able to acquire shares of Twitter less expensively during the Class Period,"" said the lawsuit.
Barron's sent an email to Tesla asking if Musk had any comment on the lawsuit but has yet to receive a reply. Musk himself made no mention of the lawsuit on his Twitter feed. Barron's also asked the SEC for comment.
Twitter shares were rising 1% to $44.91 on Wednesday. They have declined more than 36% over the past year.

84,13-Apr-22,Chicago Tribune,Elon Musk makes his move on Twitter -- but toward what?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2649491827/BFD812D457A14912PQ/663?accountid=13946,"First he said he would, then he didn't. Less than a week after the announcement that Tesla CEO Elon Musk had become Twitter's largest shareholder and would be joining the company's board, Twitter announced over the weekend that, well, not quite.Musk, the world's richest man, remains the largest shareholder of Twitter after purchasing 9.2% of the social media giant's stock, but he won't be joining the board, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced Sunday. No explanation was offered for the reversal.Joining the board probably would not have given Musk the freedom to do what he wants, although what he wants remains to be seen. Either way, news of his growing power already has ruffled more feathers in tech circles than a fox in a chicken coop.""For those of us who care about equity and accountability,"" former Reddit CEO Ellen K. Pao wrote in a Washington Post op-ed, putting Musk on the board is ""highly disconcerting -- a slap in the face, even.""But staunchly libertarian and self-described ""free speech zealot"" Musk has stirred just as much support on the other political side.Political conservatives, for example, flooded social media to call on Musk to return Donald Trump to Twitter. Trump was banned from Facebook and Twitter after the violent Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.As Trump's supporters argue, a small group of elite tech executives deprived the president of his most influential megaphones to deliver his message to the public.Maybe. But to have access to such tools, you have to follow the rules -- as laid down by the social network's owners and operators.Trump persistently violated those rules, according to then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. After the Twitter and Facebook bans, Snapchat followed suit, and YouTube suspended the president for at least a week.Yet even Dorsey lamented that the move was divisive, even inside the company, and sets a precedent that he called dangerous to a ""free and open global internet.""Sometimes you need constraints or you invite chaos. That's why the debate over Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act is so important. Passed in 1996, the early days of the internet, the act offers broad legal protections to websites to allow the internet to grow, and the law could be revisited later.Decades later, it is obvious that there is plenty for both sides to complain about and a broad array of solutions to be debated.""Free speech"" has been a key part of that debate but at a time when more people demand free speech than know what it is in the Constitution and what it means in daily life.As Trump learned the hard way, the First Amendment protects speech from government censorship, but private censorship by a company of its own publication or website is called ""editing.""That's how the free marketplace of ideas is supposed to work. You put your ideas out there, and others have the right to respond, although not necessarily on your website.If Trump didn't like it, he was advised, he is perfectly free to start up his own social network, which he did. It's called Truth Social, and the last time I checked, it remained a very lonely place. Even Trump hasn't been using it.Against that backdrop, Musk made his move on Twitter where, like Trump, he has generated controversy, along with some nervousness about his own version of free speech.""What could possibly go wrong with an oligarch determining what constitutes free speech?"" tweeted former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who in an essay in The Guardian called Musk's vision for the internet ""dangerous nonsense.""Musk's stated desire to ""free"" the internet would mean even less accountability than there is now, Reich fears, regarding who decides how algorithms are designed and set up and who gets to fill the web with lies, pseudoscience or half-truths that threaten public health, safety and the future of our democracy.But Reich's ""oligarch"" tag for Musk is not much of a put-down. When you're talking about a CEO of a private corporation in which almost all power is held at the top, it can be a fact of life. Still, Musk is fundamentally a sensible businessman. It's hard to imagine that he's trying to take over Twitter to ruin it, along with its amazing profits.As with the rest of the free market, the ultimate arbiters are the consumers, we the public. The speed and convenience of modern communications have put a bigger responsibility than ever on us, the public, to question the quality of the information we receive, not just the quantity, so that we may reach the most useful conclusions.Our freedoms depend on our vigilance.----------Clarence Page is a member of the Tribune Editorial Board.[email protected]Twitter @cptimeCAPTION: Photo: Elon Musk speaks at the Satellite Conference and Exhibition on March 9, 2020, in Washington, D.C.

85,14-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Can Elon Musk Buy Twitter? Tesla CEO's $43 billion offer contains as many questions as answers,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2650010191/BFD812D457A14912PQ/55?accountid=13946,"Twitter headquarters in San Francisco.

The richest man in the world should be able to buy anything he wants. But Elon Musk's $43 billion bid for Twitter Inc. looks like a long shot.
Shareholders aren't rallying behind him. The board is preparing to throw up roadblocks. And it isn't clear that Mr. Musk, despite his vast fortune, can come up with the money.
Like everything with the Tesla Inc. chief executive, crypto enthusiast and Twitter troll, Mr. Musk's $54.20-a-share offer flouts nearly every norm in the merger playbook. The eccentricity that helped make him a billionaire could now be a liability in the eyes of Twitter's board and the financial backers he'll need.
Mr. Musk admitted at a TED Talk Thursday that he's not sure he'll actually pull it off, though he said he has ""sufficient assets.""
He has given no indication of how he might pay for the deal. Would-be acquirers—especially uninvited ones—typically show up with the money in hand, or at least a guarantee from a bank that it will be there. Most companies won't entertain sale talks without it.
Mr. Musk is worth an estimated $250 billion or more, but is cash poor , with nearly all his wealth tied up in shares of Tesla and SpaceX, his privately held rocket company. Selling those stakes would trigger big tax bills and reduce his control.
Photos: How Elon Musk Made the Fortune He'll Need to Buy Twitter
The Tesla CEO was a millionaire in his 20s and has parlayed each business success into new endeavors
That leaves borrowing against those stakes. But that would be tricky too.
Tesla allows executives to borrow up 25% of the value of their shares. Mr. Musk's stake, worth about $176 billion today, would theoretically let him borrow about $43 billion. (Because he owns 9% already, Mr. Musk would need to come up with $39 billion to buy the rest.)
But as of last August, according to securities filings, he had already pledged 88 million shares for personal loans, which would reduce his credit limit.
Moreover, it isn't clear whether a bank would even make a loan that big secured by a single stock—especially one as unpredictable as Tesla, whose share price Mr. Musk can send swinging wildly with a single tweet. The electric-vehicle maker has traded as high as $1,145 and as low as $764 since mid-February. Stocks that volatile make for risky collateral because their value could drop quickly, leaving the bank with losses.
And Mr. Musk has alienated some of the deepest pockets on Wall Street: Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase Co., a bank known for writing big takeover checks, won't do business with the billionaire or his companies.
Mr. Musk has hired Morgan Stanley as his financial adviser. The bank is known more for top-shelf merger advice than for big loans, but would likely provide some debt financing if a deal moves ahead, a person familiar with the matter said.
Mr. Musk, who surfaced as one of Twitter's biggest shareholders earlier this month, has fielded interest from private-equity firms and other investors who might back his bid, the person said. Mr. Musk also could ease his financial burden if he can win over big Twitter investors like Silver Lake, Elliott Management Corp. and Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management—one of Tesla's most vocal boosters.
Even if he can gather the money, Twitter, which has been working on its own plan to boost the lagging shares, could reject the offer. The reaction from one high-profile shareholder Thursday could give it cover.
Saudi royal Alwaleed bin Talal, who said he is one of Twitter's largest shareholders, wrote in a message on the service : ""I don't believe that the proposed offer…comes close to the intrinsic value of Twitter.""
This isn't the first time Mr. Musk has floated a blockbuster takeover that didn't come to fruition. In 2018, he famously tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private and that he had ""funding secured.""
Mr. Musk later settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the episode, paying a $20 million fine and stepping down as Tesla's board chair. That track record may give Twitter's board air cover to reject this deal—and potential partners pause too.
And despite Mr. Musk saying of his offer that Twitter's ""shareholders will love it,"" they don't seem to, by and large. The stock was down nearly 2% to close at $45.08 Thursday—almost unheard-of after a takeover offer. That robs Mr. Musk of the investor army he may need to pressure Twitter's board.
Those directors met Thursday to review the offer with the help of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. bankers, people familiar with the matter said. Since Parag Agrawal took over as CEO from co-founder Jack Dorsey in November, the company has leaned into new revenue streams, like subscriptions, and has been refining projections that suggest it's worth more than what Mr. Musk is offering, one of the people said. Mr. Musk said in his filing that he doesn't have confidence in Twitter management.
The company is weighing adopting a so-called poison pill that will block Mr. Musk, who owns 9.2% of the company, from increasing his stake beyond 15% or so, that person said.
""The decision we make and how we execute is in our hands, no one else's,"" Mr. Agrawal said on Monday after Mr. Musk had reversed course on an earlier decision to join Twitter's board.
Mr. Musk says his offer is take-it-or-leave-it, and that he is prepared to sell his position if the answer is no. That could help explain the muted reaction in Twitter's shares.
It could also draw out a ""white-knight"" bidder, eager to own Twitter at a price well off its peak last year.
Salesforce Inc. explored such a deal in the past. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who tried to buy Twitter in 2016, wrote in his book that he badly wanted the company but was thwarted by his own shareholders, who reacted negatively when news of his interest broke.
Silver Lake, which invested $1 billion in Twitter two years ago, is also a possible buyer. The firm is restricted for now from making a bid for the company as long as its co-CEO, Egon Durban, remains on Twitter's board, according to securities filings. But it is possible the board could waive the restriction in the event the private-equity firm has an interest in a deal now.

 Can Elon Musk Buy Twitter?

86,14-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk Looks to Next Frontier After Chasing Space, Car Dreams; Tesla and SpaceX leader follows latest ambitions in Twitter bid",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2650074322/BFD812D457A14912PQ/152?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has spent a lifetime pursuing his convictions—often against great odds—from making space travel affordable to converting the world to electric-powered cars. His latest gambit: a $43 billion offer to take Twitter Inc. private in the name of defending free speech.
It isn't without clear self-interest. His rise to become the world's richest man was aided by his savvy use of Twitter to build support for his vision of the future, one that has helped him raise billions of dollars over the years from investors to fund Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp.
Acquiring Twitter would cement his control of the social media platform and—if he is correct in his desires for change—make it stronger. It would also propel him into the ranks of media mogul with a 21st Century twist.
At the core of the 50-year-old entrepreneur's efforts has been an ability to drill into an established way of doing things and question whether they could be done differently—cheaper, faster, sexier?
He also has expressed strong views about what he sees as the fallibility of public markets and benefits of being a privately held company. Those views have been shaped by his experiences in the past 20 years creating the world's most valuable auto maker, which has helped move the global automotive industry toward the electrification of the car, and igniting a space race with privately held SpaceX's success developing reusable rockets that have soared to the stars.
For a man who spent his childhood reading famed science fiction writer Isaac Asimov, who explored the worlds of robots and space travel, it seemed his ambitions were straight from those pages.
 His early successes funded those later ideas and businesses. His first startup in the 1990s aimed to take on the phone book with Zip2, which helped once mighty newspaper giants, such as Knight Ridder, digitize content. Then he was on to banking with the company now known as PayPal, then SpaceX, then Tesla, and then his latest startups that deal with underground tunneling and brain computers . His business ideas often sound like the makings of a TED Talk—an uplifting conference forum known for its futuristic and techy presentations.
The audacity of his proposals caught the attention of Hollywood. He served as an inspiration for Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of the Iron Man superhero and even had a cameo in the movie's sequel. He once dated actress Amber Heard and has two children with the musician known as Grimes.
Now with Twitter, he is arguing that by taking it private he can recast the 16-year-old company. A power user himself, who has said he crafts some of his tweets while sitting on the toilet, he has views on its strengths and weaknesses and how to shape conversations and how to attack rivals.
He said he wants an edit button , he wants greater transparency on why some tweets get traction and he wants to make the company less dependent on ad revenue to survive or else, he has warned, it lives under the influence of corporations.
Most of all, it seems, he wants to ensure that views, however abhorrent, aren't curtailed.
""I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,"" he wrote to Twitter Chairman Bret Taylor, according to a Thursday filing.
Fittingly, Mr. Musk spoke publicly about his ambitions for Twitter for the first time Thursday at a TED Talk in Vancouver, saying he will get blamed for anything that goes wrong. ""If I acquire Twitter and something goes wrong, it's my fault 100%,"" he said. ""I hope it's not too miserable.""
Mr. Musk has long complained about the media—in particular how it has covered his business dealings and certain spats with regulators . In 2018, as Tesla approached near bankruptcy amid intense media coverage, Mr. Musk lashed out on Twitter at ""the holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie.""
He proposed a Yelp.com-like site to let people rate the credibility of journalists and promised to call it ""Pravda""—a nod to the former Soviet Union's main propaganda outlet.
The idea didn't go far. In the months that followed, Mr. Musk became consumed with a fight to keep the lights on at Tesla as its assembly plant struggled to ramp production of the Model 3 compact car.
The eventual success of the Model 3, however, fueled record sales for Tesla, put it on the road to profitability and ignited investor enthusiasm, propelling the auto maker into the uncharted territory of being the first car company to be valued at more than $1 trillion .
That valuation is in part because of excitement around ideas that Mr. Musk hasn't yet actually achieved, such as deploying fully self-driving cars despite years of saying it was near such an achievement.
A will-he or won't-he drama has long followed Mr. Musk as he has tried to change entrenched industries. In that, he has inspired legions of supporters drawn to his perceived authenticity and who see him bucking at conformity by reaching for his dreams to make the world better. His bravado, ambitious promises and missed deadlines have emboldened rivals, doubters and investors to bet against him. Much of that drama in recent years has played out on Twitter where he has more than 80 million followers.
At times that attention has weighed heavily on him. During that 2018 period, Mr. Musk infamously tried to take Tesla private in a bid that seemed partially motivated by a desire to take the company out of the spotlight that came from being publicly traded. The toll it was taking on Mr. Musk was evident—he was sleeping on the factory floor and engaging in bizarre Twitter spats, including infamously suggesting a man was a pedophile.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission claimed his tweets about the efforts to go private were misleading. He and the government settled those claims in a deal that saw him give up his Tesla chairman role and agree to having some tweets vetted before pushing send. He clearly regrets that decision, arguing that he is being muzzled by the government .
At SpaceX, he has been able to avoid many public dramas and disappointed some of his employees in 2013 when he told them he preferred to keep it closely held.
""Public company stocks, particularly if big step changes in technology are involved, go through extreme volatility, both for reasons of internal execution and for reasons that have nothing to do with anything except the economy,"" Mr. Musk wrote to them in an email at the time. ""This causes people to be distracted by the manic-depressive nature of the stock instead of creating great products.""

So how would Twitter change under the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX? The social media giant confirmed Monday that Musk agreed to buy the company in a $44-billion deal. Once the deal closes later this year, Twitter will become a privately held company. ""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,"" Musk tweeted to his 84 million followers. ""I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.""  'I'm going to leave': Twitter users react to Elon Musk offering to buy the platform Elon Musk offers to buy Twitter: Musk says company 'needs to be transformed' Elon Musk's ‘free speech’ stance fires up conservatives Musk says he’s a “free speech absolutist” and has expressed concerns about Twitter straying from its roots as “the free speech wing of the free speech party.” “I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,” Musk wrote. “However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form,” he continued. “Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.” And with that, Musk waded deeper into a superheated, bitterly divisive political debate over social media moderation. On the one hand, many view limits on harmful or extreme speech are vital to free-flowing discourse on Twitter.  “Twitter works because it has limits, terms of service, rules. A ‘free speech’ board where anything goes will immediately be infested by spam, scams, racism, Nazis, trolls with nothing else to do, and hate speech,” conspiracy theory and QAnon expert Mike Rothschild tweeted. “It would be worthless and impossible to use.” Elon Musk's second secret child: Grimes accidentally reveals she and Elon Musk welcomed a secret second child via surrogate Tom Brady ask of Elon Musk: Tom Brady made hilarious request to Elon Musk amid Tesla CEO's offer to buy Twitter Conservatives, however, accuse Twitter and other mainstream social media companies that they say are run by liberal elites of selectively targeting conservatives and silencing their voices. Those grievances only escalated following the attack on the U.S. Capitol, as social media companies suspended then-President Donald Trump’s accounts. On news that Musk had made a bid for Twitter, conservative commentator Brent Bozell, founder and president of the Media Research Center, tweeted: “Free at last. Free at last. Conservatives may be free at last!” Analysts warn that making Twitter a free speech free-for-all could harm its business. They say if there was no buffering of hateful, offensive or extremist posts, individual users would be less likely to use Twitter. Advertisers and publishers, concerned about their messages being paired with problematic posts, also want content standards even if that means the platform has fewer users and is less popular, said GroupM analyst Brian Wieser. Elon Musk is 'person of the year': Elon Musk is Time magazine's Person of the Year Fact check: Fake Twitter employee tweet about Elon Musk spreads online “We think that free speech absolutism on Twitter and Musk’s preferences would likely lead to a worse business, and worse platform for advertising for large brands even if Musk were otherwise able to find ways to grow usage or users on the platform,” Wieser wrote in a blog post.  Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives says throttling content moderation would ignite "" a political firestorm with leaders from within the Beltway all the way to Brussels."" ""The last thing some of them would want to see is Musk owning Twitter,"" Ives told USA TODAY.  Would misinformation spread on Twitter if Musk takes charge? Baird analyst Colin Sebastian says Musk has been highly critical of content restrictions that Twitter considers misinformation including COVID-19. “He also has publicly advocated for tools to edit tweets – maybe because Musk has deleted many of tweets that contained controversial or offensive content,” Sebastian wrote in a research note. Reinstating former President Donald Trump could also be a factor but Sebastian says “we assume Musk has bigger ambitions.” Would Elon Musk get rid of ads on Twitter? Musk’s recent tweets suggest he’s interested in a subscription-based business and he’s not a big fan of advertising. Twitter’s subscription business called Twitter Blue gives power users additional features. Musk said he would slash the price of Twitter Blue from $3 to $2 a month and would charge for a year subscription upfront. In return, Twitter Blue users would get a blue checkmark (and guaranteed suspension if the account is used for spam). According to Musk, he would ban ads from Twitter Blue because “the power of corporations to dictate policy is greatly enhanced if Twitter depends on advertising money to survive.” Elon Musk in Texas: SpaceX launches rockets from one of America's poorest areas. Will Elon Musk bring prosperity? What Elon Musk should do with Twitter: Elon Musk should take over Twitter, shut it down and fire the social media giant into space Is Musk suggesting that Twitter end its dependence on ads? That would be difficult to pull off in the short-term. Musk would likely focus first on an ad-free Twitter Blue to build a subscription business with an eye toward phasing out Twitter’s business showing ads to users.  Twitter’s advertising business has not kept up with its social media competitors. Twitter has just 1.1% of the US digital advertising market. according to eMarketer. It’s expected to capture 1.2% next year, according to a eMarketer forecast from Insider Intelligence. Some analysts speculate that Musk is banking on power users like himself – those with the biggest followings – to get more people to tune into Twitter. Musk recently said that the most followed accounts on Twitter rarely tweet. “We believe that enhancing efforts to remove spam content would ultimately drive higher user engagement and lower churn,” Jefferies Research analyst Brent Thill wrote in a research note. “In addition, further investment in platform health could also drive more activity from the most followed accounts.” Elon Musk may be after your Twitter data Musk wouldn’t make over-the-top changes to Twitter, but rather he would want access to the users’ data if he ran the company, said Karen North, a professor at the University of Southern California and social media expert. “I think that’s what he’d want to capitalize on. Musk’s more interested in the data than the moment-by-moment tweeting,” North said. “If we went into business, what would you rather have the data or a messaging platform? Let’s go with the data.” North said she’s “not concerned yet he would create a more toxic environment,” because all social platforms have similar issues that need major addressing.  “Musk could loosen things up for users and it could be worse and things could change, but he loves to control and to be able to say things in his own way and others. It fits his pattern of behavior,” North said. “He’s a master at the message and he may be wanting to control how it gets out, big and small. “And he wants to track it, all of it.” Terry Collins is a money and tech reporter and can be reached at [email protected] This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Twitter under Elon Musk: What Twitter would look like if Tesla and SpaceX billionaire CEO was running it"
88,14-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),U.S. Stocks Drop Amid Wave of Bank Earnings Reports; Twitter zigzags after Elon Musk discloses offer to take it private,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2649899486/BFD812D457A14912PQ/308?accountid=13946,"U.S. stocks fell, with major indexes posting weekly losses, as investors worried that soaring inflation and slowing growth are starting to affect businesses.
The Dow industrials fell 113.36 points, or 0.3%, to close at 34451.23 Thursday. The S&P 500 lost 54 points, or 1.2%, to 4392.59, a day after the broad index advanced 1.1% to snap a three-day losing streak . The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dropped 292.51, or 2.1%, to 13351.08, a day after rising 2%.
Stocks meandered lower in the final hour of trading, deepening this week's losses for all three indexes. Some traders said low composite trading volume, which was about 15% below this year's daily average, according to Dow Jones Market Data, helped accelerate Thursday afternoon's declines. U.S. stock markets are closed on Friday for the holiday-shortened trading week.
Investors this week got their first peek at how companies fared in the first quarter of 2022 as earnings season kicked off in earnest. Over the past year, corporate earnings have largely been on a tear thanks to government stimulus payments and strong consumer spending. The fear among traders and investors is that rising inflation will end that trend.
""We're starting to see some cracks in the foundation of the super strong consumer, and it's starting to have some impact on company bottom lines,"" said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. ""Retail sales are still good, but we saw JPMorgan is going to raise their provisions for credit losses because there could be some defaults. At Wells Fargo, we're seeing some impact of higher mortgage rates . Sentiment is not as good.""
Big U.S. banks were expected to suffer from comparisons to bumper profits during the pandemic. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings for S&P 500 banks fell 37% from a year ago, according to FactSet.
Wells Fargo shares fell $2.19, or 4.5%, to $46.35 after the bank reported a drop in first-quarter earnings . Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup all reported results that were better than analysts' forecasts. JP Morgan reported Wednesday .
Twitter shares, which at one point were up more than 5% and subsequently fell into negative territory, ended the day down 77 cents, or 1.7%, at $45.08. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk—who holds a more than 9% stake in the social-media company—disclosed an offer to buy it outright in a deal valuing it at more than $43 billion. Tesla fell $37.37, or 3.7%, to $985.00.
More broadly, the S&P 500's communications-services sector, of which Twitter is a component, was down 0.4% on Thursday. Its tech sector was off 2.5%.
Peloton Interactive shares fell $1.16, or 4.6%, to $23.87, after the company said it would cut prices of its stationary bikes and treadmills and raise monthly subscriptions for online workout classes. On Wednesday, activist investor Blackwells Capital reiterated its push for Peloton to consider a sale.
Looking ahead, corporate results will be scrutinized for guidance on how companies expect to manage tighter policy from the Federal Reserve, with a series of interest-rate increases expected.
""Investors are trying to figure out if the Fed is on the right course. Can they stick the landing in terms of bringing inflation down without bringing the economy down?"" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth.
The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 2.808% from 2.688% on Wednesday. While wavering in recent days, the yield on the benchmark note finished the week at its highest level since December 2018 as investors gear up for rising interest rates. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.
In economic news, U.S. consumer sentiment rose in April, beating the consensus forecast of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal, according to the University of Michigan. March consumer retail and restaurant spending rose by 0.5% from the previous month, according to the Commerce Department.
In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, closed up 2.7% to $111.70 a barrel, rising nearly 9% for the week. Natural-gas prices rose, reaching levels that are unusual for this season . U.S. natural-gas futures for May delivery were up 4.3% Thursday to settle at $7.3000 per million British thermal units—a 96% rise in the year to date and the highest settle value since October 2008.
Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7% as gains for travel stocks balanced losses for telecommunication companies. The European Central Bank said in a statement Thursday that recent economic data made it more likely that the bank would end its net bond purchases in the third quarter , confirming plans to rapidly roll back the easy-money policies adopted during the Covid-19 pandemic.
In Asia, stock markets were mostly higher. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.7% and the Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.2%.

89,14-Apr-22,USA Today (Online),Twitter poison pill blocks Elon Musk. Is Musk a Republican? Musk's free speech woos conservatives,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2650031501/BFD812D457A14912PQ/329?accountid=13946,"Billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered to buy Twitter in a deal valuing the social media company at $43 billion.  “Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company,” Musk said in a filing Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.” Musk is one of Twitter’s power users with more than 80 million followers on the social media platform. He’s also been one of the company’s biggest critics.  In a letter accompanying his offer, Musk a self-described “free speech absolutist,” hinted he would return Twitter to its roots as “the free speech wing of the free speech party.” “I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,” he wrote. Twitter said its board of directors would review the proposal. Twitter under Elon Musk: What Twitter would look like if Tesla and SpaceX billionaire CEO was running it Twitter offer: Elon Musk offers to buy Twitter for $41.3 billion, saying company 'needs to be transformed' Elon Musk won't join Twitter board: Tesla CEO remains platform's largest shareholder Twitter blocks Elon Musk bid with poison pill Twitter's board of directors moved to block Elon Musk’s $43 billion hostile takeover bid Friday. Called a ""poison pill"" or ""shareholder rights plan,"" the measure allows existing shareholders to buy more shares and dilute Musk’s ownership in Twitter, making it difficult for Musk to build a stake greater than 15%. ""The Rights Plan will reduce the likelihood that any entity, person or group gains control of Twitter through open market accumulation without paying all shareholders an appropriate control premium or without providing the Board sufficient time to make informed judgments and take actions that are in the best interests of shareholders,"" Twitter said in a statement. Musk disclosed a 9.2% stake in Twitter earlier this month. He was offered a seat on the board of directors but declined and made an unsolicited bid to buy the company for $54.20 a share. He did not say how he planned to finance the purchase. The company said the poison pill “does not prevent the Board from engaging with parties or accepting an acquisition proposal if the Board believes that it is in the best interests of Twitter and its shareholders.”  – Jessica Guynn Buyout firm may also want Twitter There might be another player seeking to buy Twitter. Private equity firm Thoma Bravo has reached out to the social media platform about a possible acquisition that would rival Tesla CEO and major Twitter shareholder Elon Musk, according to Reuters.  It’s not known how much Thoma Bravo, which reportedly has more than $103 billion in assets under management at the end of 2021, would be prepared to offer, Reuters reported.  The news about a potential second bidder came after Musk tweeted Thursday that he’s offering to buy Twitter for roughly $43 billion, higher than the social media company’s current $34 billion valuation. Both Twitter and Tesla stock dropped at market closing Thursday before seeing slight rises during after-hours trading.  On Friday, Twitter put in place a corporate strategy known as a ""poison pill,"" designed to slow or block Musk's bid.  Both Thoma Bravo and Twitter on Friday declined to comment. – Terry Collins Elon Musk says he may not be able to buy Twitter after all Musk, Twitter’s largest shareholder, launched a takeover bid for the social media company Thursday, offering to buy it for $54.20 a share and take it private. But hours after he made the $43 billion takeover offer, Musk said he was not sure he would be able to buy Twitter after all. Musk made the comments at the TED2022 conference in Vancouver. Asked if there is a “Plan B” if his offer is rejected, Musk said “there is” but declined to elaborate. A regulatory filing on April 4 revealed that Musk bought a 9.2% stake in Twitter. The following day, Twitter said Musk would join its board of directors. He later turned down that offer. Musk’s offer is a 54% premium over the day he began investing in Twitter in January and would value the company at about $43 billion. He said Thursday's offer is his “best and final offer.” – Jessica Guynn 'I'm going to leave': Twitter users react to Elon Musk offering to buy the platform Fact check: Fake Twitter employee tweet about Elon Musk spreads online  Twitter weighs 'poison pill' to rebuff Musk takeover offer  The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Twitter's board of directors is considering a ""poison pill"" that would prevent Musk from increasing his stake beyond 15% ""or so.""  With the board considering roadblocks to Musk's offer, he was asked on Twitter if the board rejects his takeover, would that be acting in direct opposition to the financial interests of their shareholders? ""It would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote,"" Musk replied. ""They own the company, not the board of directors."" Later Musk tweeted: ""If the current Twitter board takes actions contrary to shareholder interests, they would be breaching their fiduciary duty. The liability they would thereby assume would be titanic in scale."" He also tweeted a yes or no poll: ""Taking Twitter private at $54.20 should be up to shareholders, not the board."" – Jessica Guynn Mark Cuban's Twitter rant about Musk Leave it to fellow straight-shooting billionaire Mark Cuban to sum up his thoughts on Musk’s quest to buy Twitter. The tech entrepreneur, the owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks and co-star of TV’s Shark Tank, went on a multi-hour Twitter rant/opine about Musk just moments after the Tesla CEO announced he filed with the Securities Exchange Commission to buy the underperforming (according to financial analysts) but influential social network. Cuban believes that Musk, Twitter’s largest shareholder, is opening a Pandora’s Box, tweeting that “every major tech company” including Google and Facebook, is on the phone with their antitrust lawyers asking if they could buy Twitter and get it approved.  “And Twitter is on the phone with their lawyers asking which can be their white knight,” Cuban tweeted. “Gonna be interesting.”  Cuban also said a potential Twitter sale won’t be limited to tech types as filthy-rich foreign investors may also be interested in the global and cultural cache Twitter provides.  But he also thinks that Twitter “will do everything possible not to sell the company” and that the company will “try to get a friendly” investor they prefer “to come in and buy Elon's shares and get him out.” Cuban concludes that Musk is “f------ with the SEC,” as Musk’s filing increases Twitter’s share price, “His shares get sold. Profit SEC like WTF just happened.” Stay tuned. – Terry Collins Elon Musk Twitter offer rejected by Saudi prince Alwaleed bin Talal  Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the major shareholders in Twitter, rejected billionaire Musk’s bid to take over the social media company. “I don't believe that the proposed offer by @elonmusk ($54.20) comes close to the intrinsic value of @Twitter given its growth prospects,” he tweeted. “Being one of the largest & long-term shareholders of Twitter, @Kingdom_KHC & I reject this offer.” Musk replied on Twitter and pinned the tweet. “Interesting. Just two questions, if I may,"" he wrote. ""How much of Twitter does the Kingdom own, directly & indirectly? What are the Kingdom’s views on journalistic freedom of speech?” – Jessica Guynn How much Twitter stock does Elon Musk own? So, with all of the melodrama surrounding Elon Musk’s pursuit of Twitter, just how much stock of the social media platform does the Tesla CEO own? Musk's 9.2% stake in Twitter comes out to about 73.5 million shares, according to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.  Twitter’s largest shareholder, Musk shook up the tech industry on Thursday by offering to buy it for $54.20 a share and take it private. That estimate comes out to about $43 billion, far higher than Twitter's current market value of about $34 billion.  After a spike for most of the day, Twitter shares closed down at 1.68% but as high as 4% during market after hours on Thursday. Meanwhile, Tesla’s stock dove more than 3.6% following Musk’s announcement. Twitter was expected to hold an all-hands meeting Thursday where Musk will surely be the main topic of discussion. – Terry Collins What Elon Musk said about Twitter at TED20in Vancouver Musk on Thursday made his first public statement at the TED2022 conference in Vancouver, Canada since disclosing his takeover offer for Twitter. On why he wants to buy Twitter: “It’s very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech. Twitter has become the de facto town square so it’s just really important that people have the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law.” On why Twitter matters: “It’s important to the function of democracy. It’s important for the function of the United States of us as a free country and many other countries and to actually help freedom in the world more broadly than the US. So I think the civilizational risk is decreased the more we can increase the trust of Twitter as a public platform. On how Musk defines free speech: “A good sign whether there is free speech is: Is someone you don't like allowed to say something you don't like? If that is the case, then we have free speech."" On why his takeover attempt is not about the money: ""My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization. I don't care about the economics at all."" On how he would make tough moderation calls: ""If it's a gray area, I would say let the tweet exist.” On making Twitter more transparent: “In my view, Twitter should match the laws of the country and really there is an obligation to do that. Going beyond that, and having it be unclear who’s making what changes to where, having tweets mysteriously be promoted and demoted with no insight into what's going on, having a black box algorithm promote some things and not other things, I think this can be quite dangerous.”  On whether Twitter should ban users: “I do think we want to be very reluctant to delete things, and just be very cautious with permanent bans. Timeouts, I think, are better than permanent bans."" On a top priority if he buys Twitter: “Eliminating the spam and scam bots and the bot armies that are on Twitter. They make the product much worse. If I had a doge coin for every crypto scam I saw, I would have 100 billion doge coins.” On whether he will be able to buy Twitter: “I am not sure I will actually be able to acquire it.” – Jessica Guynn Twitter CEO doesn’t believe company is being ‘held hostage’ by Musk Hours after Elon Musk’s bombshell tweet saying he wants to take over Twitter, CEO Parag Agrawal tried to ease his employees' concerns apparently without much luck, according to multiple reports. “I don’t believe we are being held hostage,” Agrawal told employees during an emergency all-hands meeting Thursday, according to the New York Times. The newspaper also reported that many Twitter workers believed the nearly 30-minute question and answer session lacked substance. Agrawal was legally not allowed to provide details. Agrawal said the board would follow a “rigorous process,” the tech news site also reported. During the Q&A, one Twitter employee asked how the company decided to offer Musk a board seat, according to Reuters. ""Are we just going to start inviting any and all billionaires to the board?"" Reuters reported. Agrawal said the company will act in the best interest of shareholders.  ""I have a strong point of view that people who are critical of our service, their voice is something that we must emphasize so that we can learn and get better,"" he said. A Twitter spokesman declined to comment about Thursday's meeting. – Terry Collins Is Elon Musk a Republican? What are Elon Musk’s politics? No one really knows. But conservatives have claimed him as one of their own. The billionaire Tesla CEO has sided with critics of mainstream social media who accuse Facebook, Twitter and Google of anti-conservative bias.  Conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza began lobbying Musk to buy Twitter in January. He even floated the idea of Musk taking over Twitter and then censoring liberals to teach them a lesson on “the imperative of free speech.” When D'Souza again urged Musk to buy a major social media platform to dramatically shift “the political and cultural landscape,” Musk replied: “interesting ideas.” Soon Musk was buying up shares of Twitter and being egged on by other conservative figures.  On news that Musk had made a bid for Twitter, conservative commentator Brent Bozell, founder and president of the Media Research Center, tweeted Thursday: “Free at last. Free at last. Conservatives may be free at last!” – Jessica Guynn This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Twitter poison pill blocks Elon Musk. Is Musk a Republican? Musk's free speech woos conservatives"
90,14-Apr-22,Boston Globe (Online),Can Elon Musk really buy Twitter? Here are three big questions about the bid.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2649998436/BFD812D457A14912PQ/389?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk did it again. The iconoclastic chief of the world's largest electric car maker shocked markets on Thursday with a $43 billion bid to take over Twitter.In a regulatory filing, Musk proposed buying the social media company, which he has criticized for not living up to free speech principles, among other things.“It's important to the function of democracy,” Musk said Thursday in an interview at the TED 2022 conference in Vancouver, after the news broke. “It's important to the function of the United States as a free country, and many other countries.”Less than two weeks after Musk disclosed he had bought 9 percent of Twitter's shares, he offered $54.20 per share to buy the rest and take the company private. The offer from the richest person on the planet to take control of a popular social media platform used by more than 200 million people a day raises several critical questions:<b>How likely is it Musk's bid will succeed?</b>Twitter's stock price already jumped on the news that Musk had bought a stake. Since April 4, when Musk revealed his stock purchases, Twitter shares had gained 17 percent. On Thursday, amid the takeover talk, the shares lost 1.7 percent to close at $45.08. That is well short of Musk's bid. Why the discrepancy? It reflects doubt that Musk will succeed anytime soon.In an official statement, Twitter said its board “will carefully review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the Company and all Twitter stockholders.”But Twitter's management and board of directors has seemed wary of Musk since the billionaire revealed his stake, and might choose to fight the unsolicited offer. If they reject the offer, Musk said on Thursday he has a “Plan B,” but declined to divulge any details.Last week, Twitter tried to entice Musk to join its board in return for an agreement not to take over the company. But after Musk rejected the offer, Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal warned of “distractions ahead,” adding: “The decisions we make and how we execute is in our hands, no one else's. Let's tune out the noise, and stay focused on the work and what we're building.”Twitter also has some corporate policies that could aid the company in keeping Musk at bay. For example, its board can issue new shares of preferred stock with voting rights and without needing the permission of current shareholders. Members of the board also are elected to staggered three-year terms, hindering any effort to wage a proxy contest and quickly gain control.<b>Where will Musk get the money?</b>Musk got himself in deep trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018 when he tweeted that he planned to take Tesla private and had “funding secured” to finance the deal.Musk did not have any such funding secured, the SEC said when it charged him with securities fraud. In a settlement, Musk paid a $20 million penalty, stepped down as Tesla chair, and agreed to have additional controls imposed on his communications. He has since chafed at the settlement and went to court in March to have it overturned. (On Thursday, Musk claimed he did have the funding to take Tesla private in 2018 and was coerced into agreeing to the SEC settlement.)This time around, Musk made no such boast and his filing for the takeover states that the offer is contingent upon lining up financing.Although he is listed as the world's richest person by Bloomberg with an estimated net worth of $259 billion, that doesn't mean he has $43 billion just lying around. Almost all of his wealth is tied up in Tesla and SpaceX stock. That has analysts expecting Musk would need to sell billions of dollars worth of Tesla stock to finance a Twitter takeover. That might upset Tesla shareholders. Musk could also try to line up financing by issuing debt to back the takeover, a common tactic on Wall Street.”I could technically afford it,” Musk said Thursday.<b>What could change if Musk succeeds?</b>In a letter to the chair of Twitter's board, Bret Taylor, Musk said Twitter had the potential to provide a platform for free speech around the world but added that the company “will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.”Last weekend, Musk sent out a series of tweets with ideas for changing the service. Though he subsequently deleted the posts, they could reveal his thinking about reforming Twitter.In the tweets, Musk said Twitter should stop running ads, offer an edit button, accept dogecoin as payment for subscriptions, and give all paying subscribers an authenticated blue checkmark. He also suggested Twitter turn its San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter and posted a poll asking if Twitter should remove the “w” from its name.More significant changes could happen if Musk follows his free speech inclinations to the max. Twitter has struggled to balance policing the service for misinformation and hate speech with allowing free expression and a diversity of viewpoints. The balancing act has drawn substantial criticism from right-wing politicians, particularly after former President Trump was banned from the platform last year.Asked how he would alter the balance, Musk said on Thursday that he would lean more in the direction of not deleting tweets or banning people from posting.“If it's a gray area, I would say, let the tweet exist,” he said. “I don't think I have all the answers here. But I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things and ... be very cautious with permanent bans.”Material from Globe wire services was used in this report."
91,14-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),The Musk-Twitter Saga Is Getting Complicated. Here's What Legal Experts Say Could Happen Next.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2649910118/BFD812D457A14912PQ/505?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk's back and forth with Twitter took another turn this week after a shareholder filed a lawsuit alleging that the billionaire entrepreneur violated securities laws in the way he disclosed his large stake in the social-media company. That could be just the start of the wrangling.
Last week, the CEO of Tesla (ticker: TSLA) and SpaceX disclosed a 9.2% stake in Twitter, making him the company's largest shareholder . He was poised to join the board, after tweeting about how Twitter could be improved, but then backed away. What comes next depends on how serious he is about changing Twitter's policies, legal experts say.
Musk originally disclosed his stake to the Securities and Exchange Commission using a Schedule 13G. That form is intended for passive investors rather than activists seeking changes. That choice raised eyebrows from the start given that Musk had already appeared to advocate for changes to Twitter in a series of posts in recent weeks.
Musk has opposed Twitter's content moderation policies, arguing the platform serves as a de facto public town square.
He amended the filing to a 13D, signaling an active status, only after Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal said the billionaire would join the firm's board of directors.
The new lawsuit, filed on Tuesday , alleges Musk violated securities laws because he didn't disclose his stake within 10 days after it reached 5%, as the SEC requires.
Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, tells Barron's that the plaintiff alleges that Musk's failure to disclose on time constitutes a ""fraud on the market,"" since anyone who sold shares after the deadline passed missed out on the jump in Twitter's stock price that followed Musk's eventual disclosure.
""It's an interesting argument,"" Quinn says. ""Given the immediate pop in the stock price once he filed a 13G, it's pretty obvious that the information re: Musk's shareholding was material to investors.""
Harvey Pitt, former SEC chairman and CEO of Kalorama Partners, tells Barron's the SEC could now choose to investigate the circumstances of Musk's filings. The agency could start reviewing communications related to the trades to see if the filing mistake was deliberate, which, according to Pitt, would lead to more severe sanctions than a simple mistake. The choice in filing type is important, since 13D filings require additional disclosures.
""His high profile means that if they let his infractions go, whose infractions are they going to go after?"" Pitt says of the SEC.
Musk's has sparred with the SEC in court and in public postings. A Tesla representative did not return a Barron's request to make Musk available for comment.
""The people at the SEC are professionals,"" Pitt says. ""The fact that he likes to malign them isn't going to sway them one way or another. They're going to look and see whether they have the case.""
As a 13D filer now, Musk will need to disclose each time his Twitter holdings change by 1% or more, meaning any efforts to increase his stake would draw attention from Wall Street. He'd also need to amend his filings if he formed a more specific intention for his investment, such as an acquisition, says Krishna Veeraraghavan, a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.
If Musk postures for a hostile takeover, Quinn notes that the Twitter board is setup to resist it. The board could adopt what's known as a poison pill, which would effectively cap the size of Musk's potential stake. Since only one-third of Twitter's board is up for election each year, any efforts from Musk to replace current members would span at least two years.
""If he wants to really acquire the company, he's going to have to make a public offer out there that is at a level that's high enough that other shareholders convince and put pressure on the board to then accept the offer,"" Veeraraghavan says. ""I'm not convinced he wants to do that, at this point. His 13D doesn't indicate any intent to do that currently. He can certainly afford to do it given how much money he has. So I think that's a TBD.""
A seat on the board is a typical aim of an activist investor, since from there the activist can have their voice heard and make changes from the inside, Quinn says.
""Right off the bat, as soon as Musk announced this position, he got a seat on the board and then he walked away from it,"" Quinn says. ""Whatever is going on here is not normal, so we should probably not try to put it into the normal category and not try to analyze it that same way.""
Christopher Davis, who heads the shareholder activism practice at New York law firm Kleinberg, Kaplan, Wolff & Cohen, tells Barron's it's possible that Musk didn't want to deal with the restrictions that accompany a board seat, such as board policies governing public statements and acting in the interest of all shareholders.
""If his real goal is to be the public gadfly, and satisfy his propensity to make bold public statements, I think he's in the sweet spot right now,"" Davis says. ""He's got so much that he can't be ignored, but he doesn't have so much that his hands are tied.""

Brooklyn subway attack suspect held without bail The man charged in the Brooklyn subway shooting will be held without bail, a judge ordered during the suspect's first appearance in federal court Thursday after a more-than-24-hour hunt led to his arrest the day before. Frank James, 62, was charged with a terrorist or other violent attack against a mass transportation system. In the brief hearing, James appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Roanne Mann in Brooklyn, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. James said nothing beyond telling the judge that he understood the charges against him. He is accused of carrying out an attack that left at least 29 people injured, including 10 with gunshot wounds, after he allegedly donned a gas mask, threw smoke grenades and fired on a crowded subway train. I'll take one Twitter, please Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered to buy Twitter, a swift turn days after deciding not to join the social media company's board of directors. Twitter said in a regulatory filing Thursday that Musk provided a letter to the company Wednesday with a proposal to buy the remaining shares. The 50-year-old business mogul, the richest man in the world, owns 9% of Twitter's stock, making him the biggest shareholder. In the letter, Musk offered $54.20 per share of the company's stock, which comes out to $41.3 billion, and said that would be his final offer. Musk's offer is higher than Twitter's market cap value of $36.7 billion. His reason for the offer?

Russian warship sinks The battered Russian ship Moskva sank as it was getting towed to port after being badly damaged by an explosion and fire, the country's Defense Ministry said Thursday. Russia and Ukraine provided divergent explanations for the fate of the Moskva, the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet. The Russian Defense Ministry claims the ship sank in stormy conditions after ammunition aboard exploded and caught fire. Odesa Gov. Maksym Marchenko said Ukrainian forces struck the guided-missile cruiser with two missiles. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said it mattered little for Russia whether the ship was hit by a missile or damaged by an unrelated fire. ""Neither is a particularly good outcome for them,"" he said.

93,15-Apr-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Tesla Chief's Life Guided By Passions,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2650156209/BFD812D457A14912PQ/57?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has spent a lifetime pursuing his convictions -- often against great odds -- from making space travel affordable to converting the world to electric-powered cars. His latest gambit: a $43 billion offer to take Twitter Inc. private in the name of defending free speech.
It isn't without clear self-interest. His rise to become the world's richest man was aided by his use of Twitter to build support for his vision of the future, one that has helped him raise billions of dollars over the years from investors to fund Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp.
Acquiring Twitter would cement his control of the social media platform and -- if he's correct in his desires for change -- make it stronger. It would also propel him into the ranks of media mogul with a 21st Century twist.
At the core of the 50-year-old entrepreneur's efforts has been an ability to drill into an established way of doing things and question whether they could be done differently -- cheaper, faster, sexier?
He also has expressed strong views about what he sees as the fallibility of public markets and benefits of being a privately held company. Those views have been shaped by his experiences in the past 20 years creating the world's most valuable auto maker, which has helped move the global automotive industry toward the electrification of the car; and igniting a space race with privately held SpaceX's success developing reusable rockets that have soared to the stars.
For a man who spent his childhood reading science fiction writer Isaac Asimov, who explored the worlds of robots and space travel, it seemed his ambitions were straight from those pages.
His early successes funded those later ideas and businesses. His first startup in the 1990s aimed to take on the phone book with Zip2, which helped once mighty newspaper giants, such as Knight Ridder, digitize content. Then he was on to banking with the company now known as PayPal, then SpaceX, then Tesla, and then his latest startups that deal with underground tunneling and brain computers.
The audacity of his proposals caught the attention of Hollywood. He served as an inspiration for Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of the Iron Man superhero and even had a cameo in the movie's sequel.
Now with Twitter, he is arguing that by taking it private he can recast the 16-year-old company. A power user himself, who has said he crafts some of his tweets while sitting on the toilet, he has views on its strengths and weaknesses and how to shape conversations and how to attack rivals.
He said he wants an edit button, he wants greater transparency on why some tweets get traction and he wants to make the company less dependent on ad revenue to survive or else, he has warned, it lives under the influence of corporations. Most of all, it seems, he wants to ensure that views, however abhorrent, aren't curtailed.
""I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,"" he wrote to Twitter Chairman Bret Taylor, according to a Thursday filing.
Mr. Musk has long complained about the media -- in particular how it has covered his business dealings and certain spats with regulators. In 2018, as Tesla approached near bankruptcy amid intense media coverage, Mr. Musk lashed out on Twitter at ""the holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie.""
The eventual success of the Model 3 fueled record sales for Tesla, put it on the road to profitability and ignited investor enthusiasm, propelling the auto maker into the uncharted territory of being the first car company to be valued at more than $1 trillion.
At SpaceX, he has been able to avoid many public dramas and disappointed some of his employees in 2013 when he told them he preferred to keep it closely held.
""Public company stocks, particularly if big step changes in technology are involved, go through extreme volatility, both for reasons of internal execution and for reasons that have nothing to do with anything except the economy,"" Mr. Musk wrote to them in an email. ""This causes people to be distracted by the manic-depressive nature of the stock instead of creating great products.""

94,15-Apr-22,Los Angeles Times,BUSINESS; Musk's unlikely bid to buy Twitter; Wall Street appears skeptical of Tesla CEO's well-hyped $43-billion proposal.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2650146270/BFD812D457A14912PQ/228?accountid=13946,"It was a classic Elon Musk move: announce a new offering that would radibcally transform the technology landscape, flog it onstage and in social media posts, only for it to turn out that the offering in question was nowhere close to market-ready.
Only this time, it wasn't a self-driving taxi or domestic robot or electric truck the world's richest man was touting. It was a plan to buy Twitter, Musk's favorite megaphone and time-waster and, according to him, a public square of vital importance to democracy.
Early Thursday, the Tesla and SpaceX chief executive notified the Securities and Exchange Commission of a bid to buy all of Twitter for $54.20 a share, or $43 billion. ""Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company,"" he wrote in a letter to Bret Taylor, chair of its board of directors.

Within hours, the social media service's board was reportedly mulling over strategies for holding him off, Wall Street was behaving as if the bid was another one of Musk's jokes, and Musk himself was acknowledging that it might not happen -- even while leaning on the board to take his offer straight to a shareholders' vote.
Musk opened negotiations by saying his offer was nonnegotiable; it would pay shareholders a tidy 18% premium over the current price. But given that Twitter has traded at a 52-week high of $73, it was far from the kind of offer the company's board would be hard-pressed to refuse, analysts say.
""I don't believe this board comes back ... with a yes,"" said Brent Thill, a tech analyst at the financial services and investment banking company Jefferies. ""We think the offer would have to be at $60 or above"" to avoid rejection out of hand, he said.
Thill speculated that Musk's inclusion of the marijuana-associated number 420 in the per-share offer price may have sent the wrong signal, suggesting he's playing to a crowd of fellow meme-humor enthusiasts.
Although it has a fiduciary duty to consider any bid, Twitter's board can't afford to take his offer more seriously than he himself takes it, said Tero Kuittinen, a senior analyst at the wealth management company Afalon Investment Management.
""What is the risk that Musk will handle this process in a manner that may hurt the share price? What is the risk that the transaction never closes?"" he said in a Twitter direct message. ""I'm deeply skeptical the board would accept considering the share price was recently much higher and the risk associated with capricious public comments of Mr. Musk is high.""
Traders seemed to agree. After a quick pop in price, Twitter shares closed down 1.7% to $45.08. Usually when a buyer makes such an offer, the stock price immediately rises to near the offer price if traders think the deal will go through.
In a news release, Twitter said that its board of directors ""will carefully review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company and all Twitter stockholders.""
Musk was himself supposed to join the board earlier this month but ultimately declined the offer, which would have obligated him to keep his ownership of the company below 15%.
Musk acknowledged he may have overreached during an onstage interview at the TED conference in Vancouver, Canada, on Thursday morning, saying, ""I'm not sure I will actually be able to acquire it."" He said he had a Plan B but declined to discuss it.
The Wall Street Journal reported that Twitter's board was discussing the possibility of adopting a so-called poison pill provision that would prevent Musk from increasing his current 9.2% stake in the company to more than 15%, making it harder for him to attempt a hostile takeover.
Should the board reject his offer, Thill said, ""it's really up to [Musk] where he wants to take it. I think there's really only two doors that I see that would happen. Door one is he says, 'Fine, I don't want anything to do with this team' and sells his position that he built, or he reconsiders the 'final' offer and says, 'Well, it's really not final.'""
Ali Mogharabi, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, pinned the likelihood of Twitter agreeing to Musk's terms at less than 50%. Gary Black, a managing partner at the Future Fund, expressed similar doubts. And billionaire celebrity investor Mark Cuban tweeted that Twitter ""will do everything possible not to sell.""
Whether Musk has the wherewithal to do the deal is another question. Musk settled fraud charges with federal financial regulators in 2018 after the Securities and Exchange Commission said he used Twitter to announce that he had ""funding secured"" to take his electric car company private when he did not. Musk was also late filing SEC documents about his stake in Twitter and is now facing a shareholder lawsuit over the lapse, although the SEC hasn't said anything about it.
He hasn't spelled out details on how he would finance his purchase of Twitter. Musk's personal wealth is estimated to be about $265 billion, but most of that is in Tesla stock. In order to tap that wealth, he'd need to take loans with his shares as collateral, which could hurt the share price.
Although Musk has said taking Twitter private would help it serve a ""societal imperative,"" Jennifer Edwards, executive director of the Texas Social Media Research Institute at Tarleton State University, said that having a single person exerting control over one of the biggest social networks in the world is concerning.
""When one man gains majority ownership of a company like Twitter, the checks and balances system"" that incentivizes platforms to promote the spread of accurate information online ""might become less effective"" than they'd be under a public company's board of directors, Edwards wrote in an email. (Of course, that is the case at Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., where Mark Zuckerberg's supervoting stock gives him complete control of a much larger platform.)
""Musk has just, time and again, made decisions about what's good for him,"" said Jessica Gonzalez, co-chief executive of the media advocacy group Free Press. ""He's used Twitter to sway markets to his own benefit. It's just gross. He's an unaccountable billionaire, and taking this company private would make it even less accountable.""
At the TED event, Musk said that he wanted to allow users to edit posts and that the company should be a lot more transparent about who it's banning or putting in a ""timeout"" and why. ""Tweets are being promoted and demoted with no idea what's going on,"" he said.
But pressed by host Chris Anderson on how that would work in detail, Musk said, ""I'm not saying I have all the answers here.""
Musk's interest in Twitter is predominantly ideological rather than a profitable business decision, said Greg Autry, clinical professor of space leadership, policy and business at the Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University and a space industry leader.
""He's an outspoken proponent of free speech, and he doesn't like the censorship model ever present on social media and on Twitter in particular,"" he said. ""He could do better things with his money if he wanted to just make money.""

95,15-Apr-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",'Twitter Has Extraordinary Potential. I Will Unlock It.': [Business/Financial Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2650146376/BFD812D457A14912PQ/339?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk could pledge his Tesla shares, borrow from banks or team up with private equity to raise the funds. Each option comes with caveats.People who try to take over companies typically go to great lengths to show they have put together the money they need to do it. Not Elon Musk.In his offer to take Twitter private for about $43 billion, Mr. Musk said the deal was partly contingent on ""completion of anticipated financing."" He provided no clues, however, about how exactly he would raise the funds to buy the roughly 90 percent of Twitter that he doesn't already own.""It's one of the barest-bones acquisition offers I've ever seen,"" said Howard Berkenblit, head of the capital markets team at Sullivan & Worcester, a law firm. ""It's almost like he tweeted the offer"" and plans to determine the next steps ""depending on what Twitter wants to do.""On Thursday afternoon, Twitter's board appeared to be leaning against a deal. The directors were weighing whether to adopt a so-called poison pill, a defensive corporate maneuver intended to ward off an unwanted takeover offer by making the target's shares more expensive.Twitter shareholders didn't seem to believe that Mr. Musk would be able to get the funds to cobble together a bid. Shares of a takeover target typically rise, but Twitter's stock fell almost 2 percent, closing at $45.08 -- significantly below Mr. Musk's offer of $54.20 a share.At a TED conference on Thursday, Mr. Musk said he had ""sufficient assets"" to pull off the acquisition. ""I can do it if possible,"" he said, adding that he has a Plan B if Twitter's board rejects his offer.Mr. Musk also made no secret of his bullishness. ""Twitter has extraordinary potential,"" he said in an earlier filing. ""I will unlock it.""On top of determining whether Mr. Musk has the financial heft to put together a deal, the board has to take into account the billionaire's volatile and unpredictable nature, said Drew Pascarella, a senior lecturer of finance at Cornell University.""A simple personality conflict, it does not disqualify an offer,"" Mr. Pascarella said. ""But if they are tying Elon's personality traits to the likelihood of the deal happening -- can you come up with the cash, and will the deal actually close -- then that can very much be taken into consideration.""Mr. Musk is the richest person in the world, with a net worth pegged at well north of $200 billion. But his wealth is mostly tied up in Tesla stock. As chief executive of Tesla and one of its largest shareholders, Mr. Musk owned about a fifth of the electric carmaker as of December. But Tesla limits its executives to using no more than 25 percent of their stock as collateral for borrowing, and Mr. Musk already has pledged a portion of his Tesla shares for other loans, according to company filings.He could theoretically pledge the rest of his eligible Tesla shares to raise enough funding to buy Twitter. But Tesla remains a wildly volatile stock, trading between $766 and $1,145 in a matter of weeks -- which would give pause to banks considering lending to Mr. Musk against his Tesla holdings.Mr. Musk could also go to banks to help provide the $15 billion to 20 billion in debt financing that analysts say the bid requires, which would be added to Twitter's balance sheet. But Morgan Stanley, the investment bank that is advising Mr. Musk, is not known on Wall Street for pulling together the kind of large-scale financing a purchase of Twitter would require.Morgan Stanley could rope in banks with bigger balance sheets, like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. But a tense bit of history between JPMorgan and Mr. Musk could compel the bank to sit it out. Last year, JPMorgan sued Mr. Musk over a misleading Twitter post in which he claimed to have secured funding for his offer to take Tesla private, alleging that it violated the terms of a contract between the two entities.JPMorgan declined to comment.A third option for Mr. Musk is private equity. When he contemplated taking Tesla private in 2018, he famously brought in the services of Silver Lake, a technology-focused private equity firm. Silver Lake already has a connection to Twitter. The firm's co-chief executive Egon Durban joined Twitter's board in 2020 after a $1 billion investment by Silver Lake.But there's a catch there, too. When it invested in Twitter, Silver Lake signed an agreement that severely limits its ability to acquire more than 5 percent of the company. That agreement could hinder its willingness or ability to team up with Mr. Musk.Silver Lake also declined to comment.Other private equity firms could team up with Mr. Musk, but any such deal would be complicated. Private equity firms typically seek out companies with steady cash flow so they can safely take out large sums of debt, which can be paid back with the cash the company generates. But Twitter had negative cash flow of $370 million last year and isn't a candidate for the kind of cost-cutting that private equity firms traditionally employ.Any potential partner would also have to take into account the possibility that Mr. Musk's unconventional entanglements with Twitter could draw the ire of regulators. That could reduce the likelihood of a deal even if the financing came together.Some Twitter shareholders are suing Mr. Musk for failing to disclose in a timely manner that he was amassing a stake of more than 5 percent in the company, denying them the opportunity of benefiting from the price gain when he eventually disclosed his stake.Securities lawyers said the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is the nation's top financial regulator, was likely to scrutinize Mr. Musk's moves. If it pursues a case, that could deter banks, private equity firms and Twitter shareholders from embracing his offer.Photograph(POOL PHOTO BY BRITTA PEDERSEN)"
96,15-Apr-22,Boston Globe,"Can Elon Musk really buy Twitter? Here are three big questions.: For starters, he doesn't just have $43 billion lying around.",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2650143804/BFD812D457A14912PQ/383?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk did it again. The iconoclastic chief of the world's largest electric car maker shocked markets on Thursday with a $43 billion bid to take over Twitter.In a regulatory filing, Musk proposed buying the social media company, which he has criticized for not living up to free speech principles, among other things.“It's important to the function of democracy,"" Musk said Thursday in an interview at the TED 2022 conference in Vancouver, after the news broke. “It's important to the function of the United States as a free country, and many other countries.""Less than two weeks after Musk disclosed he had bought 9 percent of Twitter's shares, he offered $54.20 per share to buy the rest and take the company private. The offer from the richest person on the planet to take control of a popular social media platform used by more than 200 million people a day raises several critical questions:How likely is it Musk's bid will succeed?Twitter's stock price already jumped on the news that Musk had bought a stake. Since April 4, when Musk revealed his stock purchases, Twitter shares had gained 17 percent. On Thursday, amid the takeover talk, the shares lost 1.7 percent to close at $45.08. That is well short of Musk's bid. Why the discrepancy? It reflects doubt that Musk will succeed anytime soon.In an official statement, Twitter said its board “will carefully review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the Company and all Twitter stockholders.""But Twitter's management and board of directors has seemed wary of Musk since the billionaire revealed his stake, and might choose to fight the unsolicited offer. If they reject the offer, Musk said on Thursday he has a “Plan B,"" but declined to divulge any details.Last week, Twitter tried to entice Musk to join its board in return for an agreement not to take over the company. But after Musk rejected the offer, Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal warned of “distractions ahead,"" adding: “The decisions we make and how we execute is in our hands, no one else's. Let's tune out the noise, and stay focused on the work and what we're building.""Twitter also has some corporate policies that could aid the company in keeping Musk at bay. For example, its board can issue new shares of preferred stock with voting rights and without needing the permission of current shareholders. Members of the board also are elected to staggered three-year terms, hindering any effort to wage a proxy contest and quickly gain control.Where will Musk get the money?Musk got himself in deep trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018 when he tweeted that he planned to take Tesla private and had “funding secured"" to finance the deal.Musk did not have any such funding secured, the SEC said when it charged him with securities fraud. In a settlement, Musk paid a $20 million penalty, stepped down as Tesla chair, and agreed to have additional controls imposed on his communications. He has since chafed at the settlement and went to court in March to have it overturned. (On Thursday, Musk claimed he did have the funding to take ­Tesla private in 2018 and was coerced into agreeing to the SEC settlement.)This time around, Musk made no such boast and his filing for the takeover states that the offer is contingent upon lining up financing.Although he is listed as the world's richest person by Bloomberg with an estimated net worth of $259 billion, that doesn't mean he has $43 billion just lying around. Almost all of his wealth is tied up in Tesla and SpaceX stock. That has analysts expecting Musk would need to sell billions of dollars worth of Tesla stock to finance a Twitter takeover. That might upset Tesla shareholders. Musk could also try to line up financing by issuing debt to back the takeover, a common tactic on Wall Street.""I could technically afford it,"" Musk said Thursday.What could change if Musk succeeds?In a letter to the chair of Twitter's board, Bret Taylor, Musk said Twitter had the potential to provide a platform for free speech around the world but added that the company “will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.""Last weekend, Musk sent out a series of tweets with ideas for changing the service. Though he subsequently deleted the posts, they could reveal his thinking about reforming Twitter.In the tweets, Musk said Twitter should stop running ads, offer an edit button, accept dogecoin as payment for subscriptions, and give all paying subscribers an authenticated blue checkmark. He also suggested Twitter turn its San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter and posted a poll asking if Twitter should remove the “w"" from its name.More significant changes could happen if Musk follows his free speech inclinations to the max. Twitter has struggled to balance policing the service for misinformation and hate speech with allowing free expression and a diversity of viewpoints. The balancing act has drawn substantial criticism from right-wing politicians, particularly after former President Trump was banned from the platform last year.Asked how he would alter the balance, Musk said on Thursday that he would lean more in the direction of not deleting tweets or banning people from posting.“If it's a gray area, I would say, let the tweet exist,"" he said. “I don't think I have all the answers here. But I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things and ... be very cautious with permanent bans.""Material from Globe wire services was used in this report.Aaron Pressman can be reached at [email protected].

97,15-Apr-22,USA TODAY,Musk offers to buy Twitter for $41.3B,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2650162816/BFD812D457A14912PQ/401?accountid=13946,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk is offering to buy Twitter, a swift turn just days after deciding not to join the social media company's board of directors.
Twitter Inc. said in a regulatory filing Thursday that Musk provided a letter to the company Wednesday with a proposal to buy the remaining shares. The 50-year-old business mogul, the richest man in the world, already has 9% stock of Twitter, which makes him the biggest shareholder. 
In the letter, Musk offered $54.20 per share of Twitter's stock, which comes out to $41.3 billion, and said that would be his final offer. Musk's offer is slightly higher than Twitter's current market cap value of $36.7 billion.
""I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,"" Musk said in the proposal. ""However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.""
Musk revealed over recent weeks that he had been buying shares in almost daily batches starting Jan. 31, prompting Twitter to offer Musk a seat on its board on the condition that he not own more than 14.9% of the company's outstanding stock, according to a filing. But Musk backed out of the deal and launched a series of since-deleted tweets about how to better the company – all before this takeover attempt.
Members of the board took issue with his surge to 9% stock and filed a lawsuit Tuesday on behalf of Twitter's shareholders, arguing that Musk did not file a Schedule 13 with the SEC within the required time and instead continued to amass Twitter shares. ""By failing to timely disclose his ownership stake, Musk was able to acquire shares of Twitter less expensively during the Class Period,"" the lawsuit says.
The SEC sued Musk after he tweeted in August of 2018 that his funding was secured to make Tesla a private company at $420 a share, but it never materialized, all while Tesla's stock price spiked. That led to Musk and Tesla paying $40 million in civil fines as well as Musk having his tweets approved by a corporate lawyer. 
Twitter has surged more than 12% in premarket trading after the billionaire's statement. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients Thursday that the power move will lead the Twitter board to ""be forced likely to accept this bid and/or run an active process to sell Twitter.""
""There will be host of questions around financing, regulatory, balancing Musk's time (Tesla, SpaceX) in the coming days but ultimately based on this filing it is a now or never bid for Twitter to accept,"" Ives said. ""The next step will be Twitter's Board officially reviewing the Musk filing/letter and then its get out the popcorn time as we expect many twists and turns in the weeks ahead as Twitter and Musk walk down this marriage path.""
The news didn't come without backlash. Venture capitalist Fred Wilson, who recently invested in Twitter and Etsy, condemned Musk's move in a tweet. 
""Twitter is too important to be owned and controlled by a single person,"" he wrote. ""The opposite should be happening. Twitter should be decentralized as a protocol that powers an ecosystem of communication products and services.""
Musk is the CEO and founder for Tesla and chief engineer and CEO for SpaceX. He's listed as the wealthiest person in the world, according to both the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and the Forbes real-time billionaires list.
Below is the full letter Musk sent to Twitter, according to the SEC filing.
Bret Taylor
Chairman of the Board,
I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy.
However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.
As a result, I am offering to buy 100% of Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, a 54% premium over the day before I began investing in Twitter and a 38% premium over the day before my investment was publicly announced. My offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder.
Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it.

98,15-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),Twitter Adopts 'Poison Pill' to Fend Off Elon Musk's Takeover Bid,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2650272860/BFD812D457A14912PQ/443?accountid=13946,"Twitter adopted a so-called poison pill Friday in a bid to ward off Elon Musk's unsolicited $43 billion takeover offer .
The board unanimously approved a limited duration shareholder rights plan ""following an unsolicited, non-binding proposal to acquire Twitter,"" the company said Friday. Twitter (ticker: TWTR) said the plan will ""reduce the likelihood that any entity, person or group gains control of Twitter through open market accumulation without paying all shareholders an appropriate control premium or without providing the Board sufficient time to make informed judgment and take actions that are in the best interests of shareholders.""
""The pill cuts off Musk's ability to make a tender offer over the heads of the board,"" Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, told Barron's. ""If he wants to buy the company, then all roads lead through the Twitter board. He can't go directly to the shareholders with his offer.""
The move doesn't prevent the board from accepting an acquisition proposal if it is in the best interests of shareholders. Adoption makes it more likely that the board rejects Musk's initial offer, however. That doesn't mean Twitter isn't for sale; a poison pill strengthens Twitter's negotiation position with Musk.
Quinn said that he wouldn't be surprised if the board turned the offer down by the end of the day on Friday. ""They'll remain open to higher offers from Musk, but they are under no obligation to accept them,"" Quinn added.
Musk, in the filing announcing his bid, said $54.20 was his final and best offer.
Most companies that reject an unsolicited offer at a higher price than where the stock is trading say it undervalues the company. Twitter, for its part, has a goal to double sales to more than $7.5 billion by 2023. If Twitter was to hit that goal, the stock could, in theory, become worth more than Musk's offer.
 Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives sees the defensive measure as predictable and said it ""will not be viewed positively by shareholders given the potential dilution and acquisition unfriendly move."" Twitter shares jumped on the news of Musk's bid Thursday morning, but turned negative as reports that Twitter was considering a poison pill surfaced.
Ives added that the move will likely be challenged in courts.
Twitter's plan expires on April 14, 2023, and would become exercisable if an entity or person acquired ownership of 15% or more of outstanding stock in a transaction not approved by the board. If the 15% threshold is crossed, each holder will be entitled to purchase additional shares of common stock at the then-current exercise price.
Musk's $43 billion offer, disclosed on Thursday, came shortly after he revealed a 9.2% stake in Twitter, making him the social media company's largest shareholder at the time. Musk rejected an invitation to join the company's board.
The SpaceX and Tesla founder could still maneuver around the poison pill. In speaking at a 2022 TED conference in Vancouver on Thursday, Musk said he had ""sufficient assets"" to secure funding for the Twitter deal.
That could be of concern to Tesla investors, who have been forced to consider whether Musk's Twitter is a distraction for the CEO. There is also some concern about how Musk would fund the purchase. Musk sold more than 15 million shares of Tesla at the end of 2021, sending shares down more than 25% in the weeks following. Shares haven't reached the pre-sale high of more than $1,220 a share.
Musk could also continue his PR campaign against Twitter and rally shareholder support, claiming that Twitter was standing against the will of shareholders, Ele Klein, partner and co-chair of the global shareholder activism group at Schulte Roth & Zabel, told Barron's earlier on Friday .
He could also threaten to launch a proxy contest to replace Twitter's board—but that could take more time, Klein added.
But since Twitter's board is classified, only one-third of its directors are up for election in any given year. That means a campaign to replace the current board would take multiple years.

 Twitter Adopts 'Poison Pill' to Fend Off Elon Musk's Takeover Bid

99,15-Apr-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)","After Toying With Twitter, Musk Now Wants It All: [National Desk]",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2650146331/BFD812D457A14912PQ/507?accountid=13946,"The billionaire executive recently became one of the company's largest shareholders. Now he says he wants to buy the whole thing and change how it handles speech.For the past two weeks, Elon Musk has made it clear he wants to own a piece of Twitter. First, he revealed that he bought 9 percent of the company. Then he toyed with joining its board of directors. And then he backed out, while tweeting a string of insults about Twitter to his 81 million followers. But on Wednesday night, he made his boldest move yet: He said he wanted to buy the whole company.Mr. Musk's unsolicited bid, which could be worth more than $40 billion, could have a big impact on political discourse around the world because he strongly supports unfettered free speech and has bristled when Twitter has removed posts and barred users.In a statement, Twitter said it would ""carefully review the proposal."" But after a board meeting that started early Thursday morning and lasted several hours, Twitter's executives and directors seemed ready for a fight. They appeared to be marshaling investors against Mr. Musk's plans, and signaled that he would have to spend billions more if he wanted to own the company.Twitter is also considering a corporate defense tactic to fend off Mr. Musk. It is weighing putting in place a so-called poison pill, a maneuver intended to ward off an unwanted takeover offer by making the target's shares more expensive, said two people who were familiar with the matter but could not speak for the company.Mr. Musk said that if he succeeded in acquiring Twitter, he intended to relax the company's moderation policies and make public its algorithm for ranking content, which controls what hundreds of millions of people see in their Twitter feeds.""Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it's really important that people have the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,"" Mr. Musk said in an interview on Thursday at a TED conference in Vancouver, British Columbia.Conservatives, who complain that Twitter is biased against them, celebrated Mr. Musk's offer. ""Musk has made clear that in order to be saved, Twitter needs a wholesale tear-down to the foundation -- its leadership must be removed,"" said Jason Miller, a longtime aide to former President Donald J. Trump, who was barred from Twitter in 2021. Mr. Miller is also the chief executive of a right-wing Twitter alternative, Gettr.But it was unclear if Mr. Musk's takeover bid and plan to turn the publicly traded Twitter into a private company will work, and he provided few details about how he would pay for it. Some investors and Wall Street analysts said that his offer of $54.20 a share was too low, and that he would need to go to at least $60 a share to appeal to shareholders. That would be 25 percent higher than the share price when Mr. Musk announced this month that he had acquired a 9 percent stake in Twitter.""You're not at some garage sale bidding on a lamp,"" said Brent Thill, an equity analyst at Jefferies. ""It's a service that is beloved by many throughout the world, and you can't just make these quick actions.""Some shareholders also dismissed Mr. Musk's offer. Prince Al Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, who described himself and the conglomerate he represents as one of Twitter's largest and most long-term shareholders, said in a tweet that Twitter should reject the offer because it was not high enough to reflect the ""intrinsic value of Twitter given its growth prospects."" Others said that the offer was sufficient but that Mr. Musk's proposed changes could spark an advertiser exodus and hurt the value of the company.Twitter's share price was down 1.7 percent when trading ended on Thursday, closing at $45.08 -- significantly below Mr. Musk's offer.Mr. Musk, who already is the chief executive of the electric carmaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX, was candid that his bid could fail. ""I do think this will be somewhat painful, and I'm actually not sure I'll be able to acquire it,"" he said. But he pressed Twitter's board for a shareholder vote, saying in a tweet that doing otherwise would be ""utterly indefensible.""A Twitter spokesman said the board would ""carefully review the proposal to determine the course of action that it believes is in the best interest of the company and all Twitter stockholders.""The poison-pill defense being considered by Twitter is a common tactic. It essentially lets a takeover target flood the market with new shares or allow existing shareholders other than the potential acquirer to buy shares at a discount -- making an acquisition more expensive.Should Twitter put such a measure in place, Mr. Musk could take his bid directly to shareholders with a so-called tender offer. If they like Mr. Musk's offer, they could sell their stock to the billionaire, allowing him to gain control of the company.The board is also considering soliciting offers from other companies that may want to acquire Twitter, one of the people familiar with its plans said, another common move among takeover targets. It was not clear if Twitter had approached anyone yet.A deal could require Mr. Musk to obtain $15 billion to $20 billion in debt financing, said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. Though Mr. Musk is the wealthiest man in the world, much of his worth is tied up in Tesla shares.Twitter could question Mr. Musk's ability to finance the deal or claim it undervalues the company. The offer is a 54 percent premium over the share price the day before he began investing in the company in late January. But shares of Twitter traded higher than Mr. Musk's bid for much of last year.When Mr. Musk announced his stake in Twitter, several board members welcomed him, including Twitter's co-founder Jack Dorsey. Twitter offered Mr. Musk a seat in its boardroom, a move that executives hoped would prevent him from publicly criticizing the company. But the welcome quickly soured. Mr. Musk turned down the board seat.By Wednesday, Mr. Musk was ready to disclose his next move. In a message to Bret Taylor, the chairman of Twitter's board, Mr. Musk said: ""I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy,"" according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that was later made public. ""Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company.""Mr. Taylor, a co-chief executive of Salesforce, has served on Twitter's board since 2016, when Salesforce considered buying Twitter. Mr. Taylor joined Salesforce a year later, after it acquired his own company, Quip.Another important board member is Egon Durban, a co-chief of Silver Lake, a private investment firm. Mr. Durban joined Twitter's board in 2020 as part of a deal the company struck with another activist investor, Elliot Management, which wanted to shake up leadership. Mr. Dorsey is friendly with Mr. Musk, but he is set to leave the Twitter board next month.Mr. Musk has not said exactly what he would do with Twitter, the product. But in private conversations, he has proposed a version of Twitter where moderating objectionable content is a thing of the past, according to a person who has spoken with Mr. Musk in recent days.But that vision is light on details. When challenged on how Twitter should deal with violent or oppressive speech, Mr. Musk has been dismissive. He proposed limiting moderation to tweets that were ""a crime"" according to U.S. law during his TED interview on Thursday.Twitter forbids a variety of speech on its platform, including spam, violent threats, coordinated disinformation campaigns and the sharing of private information. It has also cracked down on misinformation about the outcome of elections and the Covid-19 pandemic.Many Twitter employees have vocally protested Mr. Musk's involvement in the company since his investment was announced in early April, arguing that he would shift the company culture and damage its efforts to control problems like bullying, threats and misinformation on the platform. Others have noted he isn't always for free speech, and has cracked down on outspoken Tesla employees and an account that followed the movements of his private jet.In an emergency all-hands company meeting on Thursday afternoon, Twitter's chief executive, Parag Agrawal, sought to calm employees and said that ""I don't believe we are being held hostage"" by Mr. Musk. He was asked why he wasn't tweeting more to counter Mr. Musk's frequent criticism.Employees pressed Mr. Agrawal on when and how the board would make a decision. He demurred, saying that the board would be rigorous but that he could not share more about the process. He warned employees that they would hear more about the board's eventual decision on Twitter itself, rather than from leadership.Mr. Agrawal also faced questions about what an acquisition by Mr. Musk would mean for the company's culture and for employees' stock compensation. Mr. Agrawal urged employees to focus on things within their control and said he would do the same.""I believe Twitter stands for way more than one human, any human, me or anyone else, and their values. Twitter stands for open, public conversation,"" he said. ""It is best defined by everyone who uses the service.""Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.Jeremy W.

100,15-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),Would Musk Allow Trump Back on Twitter? The Changes Ahead if He Wins Control.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2650275578/BFD812D457A14912PQ/607?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk wants to let virtually anyone say virtually anything on Twitter if he succeeds in buying the social media platform .
What that free-speech paradise would look like—and who would want to hang out there—is another question.
""If his answer is going to be, 'If it's legal, it stays up,' whatever he's building will be unmanageable and won't be useful to most users,"" said Matthew Feeney, director of the Project on Emerging Technologies at the Cato Institute, the libertarian think tank.
Hours after Musk disclosed his offer to pay $54.20 a share in a deal that would put Twitter under his private ownership , the Tesla CEO said during an interview at a TED conference in Vancouver Thursday that he aimed to recast Twitter as ""an inclusive arena for free speech.""
""Twitter has become kind of a de facto town square, so it's really important that people both have the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely, within the bounds of the law,"" he said.
His vision would run counter to recent moves by Twitter and other mainstream social media sites, including Meta Platforms' Facebook, to more aggressively police their properties for cases of online harassment, disinformation, and other speech deemed detrimental to public discourse.
Twitter attaches warning labels to tweets that contain misleading information about the coronavirus vaccine and has stopped content from official Russian government accounts from being recommended in timelines, notifications or elsewhere on the site as that country wages war in Ukraine.
After Donald Trump used Twitter to sow doubt about the legitimacy of his electoral defeat in the days surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, mob attack on the U.S. Capitol building, the former president was permanently booted from the platform.
Musk, a prolific and sometimes controversial tweeter himself, appears to want to take the site in a more laissez-faire direction.
""My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,"" Musk said at the TED conference.
To some—especially those on the political left—that would be an unwelcome development.
""In the worst-case scenario, having Elon Musk successfully turn Twitter into the free-speech absolutist site he wants it to be could be pretty catastrophic for the information ecosystem,"" said Jesse Lehrich, a co-founder of the advocacy group Accountable Tech.
Lowering the guardrails on what users can and can't post would encourage falsehoods, propaganda and hate speech to proliferate among Twitter's hundreds of millions of users, many of whom depend on the platform as a primary source of news and information, Lehrich said.
Meanwhile, it was virtually certain that Trump would be invited back onto the site if Musk became its owner, Lehrich said.
Trump, for his part, said in an interview with Americano Media that aired Wednesday—after Musk had disclosed a 9.2% stake in the company, but before he said he planned to acquire the company outright—that he ""probably wouldn't have any interest"" in rejoining the platform.
If Trump did return to Twitter, it would clear the way for Facebook and Alphabet's YouTube to remove the former president from the blacklists they also placed him on in the days surrounding the January 2021 insurrection, Lehrich said.
""I don't think it's a stretch to say that could well change the outcome of the 2024 election,"" he said. ""This could be nothing at all. It could also be hugely consequential.""
Still, that degree of influence would depend on Twitter being able to retain—and grow—its existing user base under a new, more libertarian regime, which some don't see as a certainty.
""It's one thing to say Donald Trump should be online. That's a long way from beheading videos and animals being crushed to death,"" said Cato's Feeney. ""It's a little too flippant and unrealistic to say, 'Anything goes.'""
Phil Napoli, director of the DeWitt Wallace Center for Media and Democracy at Duke University, said there are already corners of the internet that offer venues for unfettered expression, but they don't seem to be drawing a critical mass of users.
The Parler platform places few restrictions on its posts, but it has failed to claim much of the social-media market, while Trump's own proposed Truth Social platform appears to be struggling to get off the ground, Napoli said.
""When these places try to put this sort of libertarian platform model into effect, it devolves pretty quickly and it's not entirely clear that's a recipe for growth or sustainability,"" he said.
Yet, Napoli said, ""Elon Musk may be in a position where it's something he's able to subsidize and take a loss on if it's something he feels that strongly about.""
Indeed, Musk, the world's richest person, said at the TED conference that he doesn't ""care about the economics at all"" regarding his bid for Twitter.
""This is not a way to make money,"" he said.

101,16-Apr-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Twitter Deploys A 'Poison Pill' Against Musk: [National Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2650348533/BFD812D457A14912PQ/282?accountid=13946,"The company is intent on fending off the billionaire's bid to buy it in a deal that could be worth more than $40 billion.Twitter does not want to become a plaything of the world's richest person.So on Friday, it turned to a tried-and-tested corporate defense mechanism invented in the 1980s -- the heyday of the corporate raider -- to block a potential takeover attempt by Elon Musk and buy its board some time.The mechanism, known as a poison pill, has a simple intention: to make it less palatable for a potential buyer to pursue the target company if the buyer accumulates shares above a certain threshold. In Twitter's case, if Mr. Musk bought more than 15 percent of the company, Twitter would flood the market with new stock that all shareholders except Mr. Musk could buy at a discounted price.That would immediately dilute Mr. Musk's stake and make it significantly more expensive for him to buy the company. Mr. Musk currently owns a little more than 9 percent of Twitter's stock.Twitter said its plan would be in place for just shy of one year. The tool will not stop the company from holding talks with any potential buyer, and will give it more time to negotiate a deal that Twitter's board believes best reflects the company's value.The strategy ""does not mean that the company is going to be independent forever,"" said Drew Pascarella, a senior lecturer of finance at Cornell University. ""It just means that they can effectively fend off Elon.""Twitter is weighing whether to invite bids from others, two people close to the company said. Should it decide to court buyers, Silver Lake, a private equity firm that already owns a significant stake in Twitter, could be a possibility, the people said. Silver Lake, a technology-focused buyout fund, has more $90 billion in assets under management, and a managing partner there, Egon Durban, sits on Twitter's board.Silver Lake has come to Twitter's rescue before. In 2020, when Elliott Management, an activist investor, amassed shares in Twitter and wanted it to make changes, Silver Lake helped the parties reach a compromise. As part of the deal, Silver Lake invested $1 billion in Twitter.But Silver Lake also agreed at the time not to acquire more than 5 percent of the company, so Twitter would have to waive that so-called standstill agreement before it could entertain any offer from Silver Lake. It's also not clear whether Silver Lake, which has its own history with Mr. Musk, having worked on his unsuccessful effort to take Tesla private, will offer a deal or has the financing necessary to do so on its own.Silver Lake comment declined to comment.At least one other private equity firm, Thoma Bravo, is weighing a possible offer for Twitter, Reuters reported and a person familiar with Thoma Bravo confirmed.Poison pills have been around for decades. The lawyer Martin Lipton, a founding partner of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, invented the maneuver, also called a shareholder rights plan, in 1982. It was a way to shore up a company's defenses against unwanted takeovers by so-called corporate raiders like Carl Icahn and T. Boone Pickens.They have since become a part of the corporate tool kit in America. Netflix adopted a poison pill in 2012 to stop Mr. Icahn from buying up its shares. Papa John's used one against the pizza chain's founder and chairman, John Schnatter, in 2018.Investors rarely try to get around a poison pill by buying shares beyond the threshold set by the company, according to securities experts. One said it would be ""financially ruinous,"" even for Mr. Musk.But Mr. Musk, who is worth more than $250 billion and is the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, rarely abides by precedent. He announced his intention to acquire Twitter on Thursday, making public an unsolicited bid worth more than $40 billion. In an interview at a TED conference later that day, he took issue with Twitter's moderation policies, which govern the content shared on the platform.Twitter is the ""de facto town square,"" Mr. Musk said, adding that ""it's really important that people have the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law."" Twitter currently bans many types of content, including spam, threats of violence, the sharing of private information and coordinated disinformation campaigns.Mr. Musk argued that taking Twitter private would allow more free speech to flow on the platform. ""My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,"" he said during the TED interview. He also insisted that the algorithm Twitter uses to rank its content, deciding what hundreds of millions of users see on the service every day, should be public for users to audit.Mr. Musk's concerns are shared by many executives at Twitter, who have also pressed for more transparency about its algorithms. The company has published internal research about bias in its algorithms and funded an effort to create an open, transparent standard for social media services.On Friday, Twitter said its board, which includes Jack Dorsey, a co-founder of Twitter who is friendly with Mr. Musk, voted unanimously to approve the shareholder rights plan. Twitter is working with two Wall Street banks, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, people familiar with the matter said, as it weighs its options. Mr. Musk is working with Morgan Stanley.Mr. Musk said at the TED conference that if Twitter's board rejected his offer, he had a Plan B, though he did not share it. Already, analysts have said that his bid -- which offers significantly more per share than the current stock price but is well below its peak last year -- may undervalue the company and that he may need to raise it. They have also raised concerns about Mr. Musk's ability to cobble together financing.Mr. Musk could challenge the poison pill in court, but that's unlikely to be successful, said Edward Rock, a professor of corporate governance at the New York University School of Law.""The first question will be: Does this bid pose a threat to Twitter and shareholders? And there are lots and lots of arguments they can make that it does pose a threat,"" Mr. Rock said.Mr. Musk seemed to be girding for a protracted fight. When he notified the board of his bid on Wednesday, he said that it was his ""best and final offer"" and that he would ""reconsider my position as a shareholder"" if it was rejected.But at the TED conference on Thursday, he acknowledged that he did not like to lose. And later in the day, he took to his favorite social media platform: ""Taking Twitter private at $54.20 should be up to shareholders, not the board,"" he tweeted, alongside a Yes/No poll.PhotographElon Musk before his interview on Thursday at a TED conference in Vancouver, British Columbia.

102,16-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Twitter Adopts Poison Pill Plan to Block Elon Musk From Increasing Stake; The social-media company takes the step a day after the tech entrepreneur made a $43 billion unsolicited takeover bid,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2650479865/BFD812D457A14912PQ/440?accountid=13946,"Twitter Inc. moved to prevent Elon Musk from significantly increasing his stake, a day after he unveiled a $43 billion unsolicited takeover bid for the social-media company.
The company on Friday adopted a so-called poison pill that makes it difficult for Mr. Musk to increase his stake beyond 15%. The billionaire CEO of Tesla Inc. already owns a more-than 9% stake that he revealed earlier this month.
Can Elon Musk Buy All of Twitter? How Tesla's CEO Made His Fortune
Poison pills, also called shareholder-rights plans, are legal maneuvers that make it hard for shareholders to build their stakes beyond a set point by triggering an option for others to buy more shares at a discount. Invented by famed corporate lawyer Martin Lipton in 1982, they are often used by companies that receive hostile takeover bids to block an unwanted suitor or buy time to consider their options.
In the case of Twitter's pill, should Mr. Musk or anyone else take control of 15% or more of Twitter's shares, all other shareholders would gain the right to purchase additional shares for what would effectively be half-price. That would quickly dilute Mr. Musk's stake and make buying more shares expensive. The pill, exact details of which Twitter said it will provide in an upcoming filing, remains in effect for roughly a year.
Twitter said in a statement that the rights plan doesn't prevent the company from engaging with potential acquirers or accepting a takeover bid if the board determines it is in the best interest of shareholders. It earlier confirmed it received Mr. Musk's offer and is reviewing it.
The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Twitter was weighing installing a poison pill.
Mr. Musk may not be the only suitor for the company, as people familiar with the matter say that Thoma Bravo LP and other private-equity firms are now circling as well. But just because they are running the numbers doesn't mean any of the firms will make a formal bid or that such a deal would come together.
Taking Twitter private would be no small feat; indeed, private-equity firms have explored and decided against it in the past. It would rank as one of the largest leveraged buyouts of all time, and Twitter doesn't have the attributes of a typical LBO target like strong, stable cash flow. It is possible the buyout firms are also eyeing something short of a full takeover.
The New York Post earlier reported on Thoma Bravo's interest in Twitter.
The private-equity firm, which specializes in the technology sector and manages roughly $100 billion, has been busy lately at a time of heightened buyout activity. It agreed to buy Anaplan Inc. for $10.7 billion in March, and SailPoint Technologies Inc. just days ago for $6.1 billion.
Mr. Musk, also the founder of privately held rocket company SpaceX, offered to pay $54.20 a share for Twitter and said that was his ""best and final"" bid. He has been criticizing how Twitter moderates content, among other things, and briefly agreed this month to join its board before backing out.
His takeover offer has prompted speculation that a white-knight bidder such as another technology company or private-equity firm could surface as an alternative to a deal with the unpredictable and outspoken entrepreneur.
One possible outcome is that Twitter rejects Mr. Musk's offer as too low but leaves the door open for him to return with a higher one, some of the people said. Mr. Musk said if the offer isn't accepted, he will reconsider his position as a shareholder of the company. He also has said he has a Plan B, without detailing it.
One big question mark is how Mr. Musk would fund any deal . Though he is the world's richest man, much of his wealth is tied up in Tesla shares and his offer didn't have details on financing plans, which, like other aspects of the bid, is unusual. The Journal reported Thursday that Morgan Stanley would provide some debt financing for the bid and that Mr. Musk has received approaches from investors interested in backing it.
""There are a plethora of multibillionaires eager to fund Elon for whatever he wants to do,"" said Joe Lonsdale, an Austin, Texas, venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir Technologies Inc.
One big name who doesn't plan to put in money is Peter Thiel, a longtime associate of Mr. Musk dating back to their days as executives at PayPal Holdings Inc. While Mr. Thiel, a fellow billionaire who has invested in several of Mr. Musk's companies, has expressed to friends broad support for Mr. Musk's anything-goes vision for Twitter, he doesn't plan to back any bid, according to people familiar with his plans.
Existing Twitter shareholders supportive of Mr. Musk could also roll over their holdings into any deal.
But in a sign that Twitter's investors overall appear less than enthusiastic over Mr. Musk's bid, the company's shares closed down nearly 2% Thursday at $45.08. The market was closed Friday for the Good Friday holiday.

 Twitter Adopts Poison Pill Plan to Block Elon Musk From Increasing Stake

103,16-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),The Numbers Behind Elon Musk's Bid to Acquire Twitter,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2650482397/BFD812D457A14912PQ/483?accountid=13946,"I have an urgent message for Elon Musk: When the number 58,008 is turned upside down on a calculator, the 8s looks like Bs and the 5 a bit like an S, yielding an informal anatomy term that gets a laugh from young schoolboys every time. Rhymes with ""tubes."" It's a potential game-changer for the attempted Twitter takeover.
See, naughty numbers play a pivotal role in Musk math. His $54.20 bid for Twitter (ticker: TWTR) isn't based on the risk-adjusted present value of future anything. It comes from taking Twitter's price of $45.85 before the deal announcement and determining the next-highest price that contains 420, a nod to cannabis culture that refers to lighting up at 4:20 p.m. Recall that, in 2018, Musk famously tweeted, ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.""
Nowhere, by the way, does professor Aswath Damodaran discuss this pricing model in the third edition of Investment Valuation: Tools and Techniques for Determining the Value of Any Asset.
Musk has another favorite number, and decorum keeps me from precisely explaining its meaning here. Let's just say that the digits 6 and 9, when placed in close proximity, evoke a certain nonfinancial merger of two consenting parties. ""Due to inflation 420 has gone up by 69,"" the world's richest person tweeted in November.
At a TED conference this past Thursday, Musk explained—you might want to hydrate and pack a compass for this long walk—that a book called The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy refers to 42 as the answer to the ultimate question of life, and that 42 times 10 is 420, and that it's possible to have a triangle with angles measuring 42, 69, and 69 degrees.
Nowhere is this even hinted at in Geometry, by Ray C. Jurgensen.
I'm pretty sure that Musk is making a running meta-joke about the absurdity of a brilliant engineer and accomplished business leader inserting lowbrow references into highbrow settings.
It isn't super-funny, but it goes over big-time on Twitter, and Musk pursues bawdy numerology laughs with the same perseverance he has used to upend space travel and the global automotive trade. All of that has led to scattered and only half-joking speculation that mere days from now, on 4/20, he will up his Twitter offer to $69.
On-brand but unlikely, I say, and not just because Musk has called $54.20 his best and final offer. His current bid is bullish, but not preposterous. Before Musk came courting, Twitter stock sat below $40, five bucks less than it fetched at the end of its first day of trading in 2013. But it also topped $70 just last year. New management has a plan, or at least a goal, to pass $7.5 billion in revenue by 2023, a three-year doubling, while reviving user growth.
Suspend disbelief about whether Twitter's goals are achievable. Then extrapolate out to 2025, and $10 billion in revenue; apply a peppy software multiple of four to five times this distant, theoretical revenue; pause for a few ounces of good rye whiskey; and then factor in that Musk can borrow cheaply against inflated Tesla stock (TSLA) to pay for his $43 billion takeover. It all starts to look rather reasonable.
But one key Twitter shareholder, Saudi Prince al-Waleed bin Talal and his Kingdom Holding Company, balked that the offer was below Twitter's ""intrinsic value."" That's a sophisticated term for a totally arbitrary price that gives the illusion of having achieved mathematical certainty—standard business school stuff.
On Friday, Twitter adopted a poison pill to make it difficult for Musk to increase ownership beyond 15%. Musk says he won't remain a shareholder if his offer is rejected. Twitter recently traded at $45, far below the deal price. That leaves shareholders facing a big potential move in either direction. (See our related article for a perspective on what to do with the stock.)
If Musk were to raise his bid to his aforementioned other favorite number, that would price the deal at $55 billion, which is an ambitious 5.5 times that speculative, far-off revenue. Musk says he's not pursuing this deal to make money, but I doubt he's doing it to lose money.
That's where my opening proposal comes in. A price of $58.008 a share for Twitter comes out to a much more reasonable $46 billion and change. Don't tell Prince Talal what it spells when turned upside down—he'll appreciate that Musk's use of a third decimal place suggests that he takes intrinsic values seriously. Twitter management might feel that Musk is at least meeting them partway. And Musk will get his favorite publishing platform at a meta-joke price.
I'm sorry to interrupt this high-finance discussion for a few words on companies turning profits, but earnings season is here. This coming week, companies representing 15% of the S&P 500 index's market value will report quarterly results, followed by 48% the following week, and 16% the week after that. By Mother's Day on May 8 (don't forget those brunch reservations), the relative health of the stock market will have been revealed.
Expect good news. First-quarter earnings growth for the index is pegged at 4.6%, a big downshift, but then, companies are no longer bouncing back from depressed levels. Grumps will point out that without windfall energy profits, the estimate would be near-flat. Tell them that without banks slumping on Russia-related losses and the pinch of a flattened yield curve, earnings would be seen growing 14%.
Also, companies usually beat earnings estimates. Factor that in, and earnings could swell 9% or more, reckons Credit Suisse.
Not all company reporting is clumped in the weeks ahead. There are weirdos like Nike (NKE) and Conagra Brands (CAG), both of which use fiscal years that end in May, and so are out of sync with the rest.
BofA Securities would like you to know two things about the nearly two dozen companies whose results trickle in before the rest. Their upside earnings and revenue surprises have historically shown a 71% correlation with surprises for the rest of companies. And this time around, the early birds have been beating estimates nicely.

 The Numbers Behind Elon Musk's Bid to Acquire Twitter 
Credit: By Jack Hough "
104,16-Apr-22,New York Daily News,Musk to find Twitter bitter ; Company concocts a 'poison pill' to fend off tycoon's takeover,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2650361510/BFD812D457A14912PQ/676?accountid=13946,"Swallowing Twitter whole just became a little more challenging for the world's richest man.
The social-media platform's board of directors said Friday that it had voted unanimously to enact a ""poison pill"" defense to stop Elon Musk from buying the company. Musk owns 9.2% of the tech giant's stock.
Musk, who is worth more than $274 billion, has offered to buy Twitter outright for more than $43 billion.
Twitter said in that event, investors other than Musk would be allowed to purchase additional shares at a discount, which would dilute Musk's stake and make it more challenging for the Tesla tycoon to build a coalition of shareholders to approve the acquisition.
According to Twitter, its defensive strategy would allow investors to ""realize the full value of their investment"" by preventing a single investor from taking control of the company without paying shareholders a premium or giving board members sufficient time to weigh their options.
The poison pill will go into effect if Musk's holdings hit 15%.
Only Vanguard Group, which holds 82.4 million shares, about 10.3% of the company, owns a larger share of Twitter.
Tactics like the one Twitter has enacted are known as shareholder-rights plans and designed to make hostile takeovers of companies more expensive than a company is worth.
Should Musk force a proxy fight, shareholders would vote on whether they want to keep or dismiss Twitter's current board of directors.
On Thursday, Musk took a poll on Twitter asking if taking Twitter private at $52.40 per share should be up to the shareholders or the board. As of Friday afternoon, 83.5% of the nearly 2.86 million respondents picked the former.
""They're gearing up for a battle here with Musk,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said.
Legal action is unlikely to help Musk, said Columbia University law professor John Coffee.
""No court has overturned a poison pill in the last 30 years,"" Coffee said.
After Musk's announcement on Thursday, Twitter stock fell 1.68% on the day, well below Musk's offer. There was no trading on Friday, as the market was closed for Good Friday.

105,18-Apr-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Musk Marshals an Army Of Social Media Superfans,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2651610001/BFD812D457A14912PQ/257?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk might have more than 82 million Twitter followers, but only a handful of those can consistently grab the billionaire's attention and rally Tesla Inc.'s social-media army.
Among the few: a software developer in San Francisco previously banned from Twitter, a former design student in Germany who now works for Tesla, a psychologist in Dayton, Ohio, and an information-technology worker in India.
People behind the handful of Twitter accounts are Tesla owners, electric-car proponents or investors in the auto maker, if not all three. The users share ebullient messages about Tesla vehicles, gossip about other auto makers and organize treks to corporate events.
They also defend Mr. Musk and his companies on the platform and through YouTube channels, podcasts and websites. Some have been accused of online harassment by other Twitter users, and, in at least one instance, the community turned against one of their own after the CEO questioned his allegiance.
""The gravity of this guy and the impact he's having in so many industries is so massive that you just get pulled in,"" said Omar Qazi, who jointly runs @WholeMarsBlog, one of the accounts that Mr. Musk replies to most often. ""People are trying to attack you just for talking to him.""
Mr. Musk, as the world's richest man and boss of a $1 trillion company, is one of Twitter's most influential users. He has gained renown for posting memes, bashing short sellers and making eyebrow-raising statements, from mocking regulators to joking about quitting his job. This past week the Tesla CEO made an offer to buy the shares of Twitter he didn't own in a deal valuing the company at roughly $43 billion.
Most of Mr. Musk's Twitter activity consists of replying to other tweets, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Twitter data. As of Friday the Tesla boss has replied to tweets from about 5,700 accounts since June 2009, according to the Journal analysis. Roughly 20 accounts, nearly all of which have articulated support for Mr. Musk and his companies, have received more than a fourth of those replies.
Mr. Musk's public connection with Tesla fans has nurtured a sense of community among investors and customers, his supporters say. Tesla benefits from the digital-content creators to help market its products and has largely avoided spending large sums on advertising. Company referral programs have provided customers with free vehicles and use of its quick-charging stations, among other perks.
Mr. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment. Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment.
Earl Banning, a psychologist in Ohio, is known in the Tesla community for taking a picture of his dogs in the front trunk of his Model X and helping to popularize the ""Frunkpuppy"" trend. Eventually Mr. Musk and his mother would contribute with their own pictures. ""Once you're kind of known as one of the people that Elon responds to, people want to follow you,"" Mr. Banning said.
Mr. Banning, whose account @28delayslater has 70,100 followers, has embraced being a Tesla influencer. He said he logs into Twitter most mornings and then schedules tweets to post throughout the day, many of them memes about Tesla news or Mr. Musk.
When Tesla's CEO said on Twitter that his Wikipedia page was insane in December 2019, German college student Vivien Hantusch suggested in a tweet that he join her, Mr. Qazi and others on their Tesla-focused podcast to discuss what was wrong with it. The group was invited to Mr. Musk's residence and then recorded a three-hour interview.
Ms. Hantusch had about 134,200 followers in December 2021 when she deactivated her account @flcnhvy, even though it was one of the two accounts with the most replies from Mr. Musk.
Two screenshots of Tesla's internal employee directory reviewed by the Journal show Ms. Hantusch is listed as an assistant to the CEO. Videos posted online from Tesla's first European factory opening last month showed Ms. Hantusch alongside a group that included German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Mr. Musk. She didn't respond to email and phone messages seeking comment.
Pranay Pathole, a software engineer from Pune, India, tweeted at the Tesla boss at least 160 times over roughly a year before he got a reply. In January 2018 he tweeted about a problem with the windshield wipers being triggered when opening a Tesla car door. Mr. Musk replied that the issue would be ""fixed in next release,"" a reference to a vehicle software update. Once the tweet came, Mr. Pathole said he ran to tell his mother and father.
Now Mr. Pathole has 125,100 followers on his account, @Ppathole, and fields requests from people to pitch business ideas to Mr. Musk. He recently asked if the CEO would ""consider building a new social-media platform with an open source algorithm, where free speech is given top priority."" The Tesla chief replied, ""Am giving serious thought to this,"" and on Thursday he said that he would implement those ideas if he were able to take Twitter private.
""Musk possesses an extraordinarily savvy command of social media, and he has an army of Muskites that he can influence to treat any stock, or even cryptocurrency, as a meme stock,"" said Eric Seufert, an independent analyst and owner of the Mobile Dev Memo trade blog.
One Tesla owner and investor who had connected with Mr. Musk on Twitter is no longer getting replies from him. In April 2019 Mr. Musk singled out Frederic Lambert, of Montreal, as being ""de facto anti-Tesla"" as a result of articles he wrote on Electrek, a site that aggregates news about electric vehicles.
Mr. Lambert said at that time, at least 50% of his stock portfolio was Tesla shares, and he owned a Tesla Model S and Model 3. ""At first, I thought it had to be a mistake,"" he said. His biggest hero had publicly turned on him, and he said the Tesla community followed its leader.

106,18-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Isn't Going Away if Twitter Rejects Him. Here's What He Might Pay.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2651680917/BFD812D457A14912PQ/410?accountid=13946,"Even if the Twitter board rejects Tesla CEO Elon Musk's offer to buy the social-media platform, he won't go away immediately. There is more drama to come. Elvis Presley has something to do with it.
Musk tweeted out a lyric from the Presley hit Love Me Tender on Saturday. That isn't much of a tell, but following the Tesla (ticker: TSLA) CEO requires a master's degree in Twitter-ology.
That training would lead longtime Musk followers to the conclusion that the tweet isn't innocent. And many of the 30,000-plus comments received as of Monday morning refer to Musk's potential takeover of Twitter (TWTR). There are also comments asking for a car as well as bots pushing cryptocurrencies.
Musk didn't reply to a Barron's question attached to the original tweet.
In his communication to the Twitter board offering to buy the company, Musk indicated that $54.20 a share was his best and final takeover offer, saying that if the board didn't accept it, Musk was likely to sell his stock.
""If the deal doesn't work, given that I don't have confidence in management nor do I believe I can drive the necessary change in the public market, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder,"" reads his April 13 correspondence.
Those statements look like more of a negotiating tactic in light of the Saturday tweet. A tender offer, as in Love Me Tender, is the next level in a hostile bid for a company. It bypasses a board of directors and appeals directly to shareholders to tender, or sell their stock, to the bidder at a set price.
The trick with this tender is that Twitter adopted a shareholder rights plan, more commonly known as a poison pill, on Friday, the day before Musk's ""tender"" tweet. Rights plans are designed to thwart hostile bids by giving everyone but the unwelcome bidder the right to buy stock. It makes acquiring a company more expensive.
""A triggering event, for poison pill purposes, is either a tender offer for, or an actual acquisition of, the requisite percentage of the corporation's stock,"" accounting expert and longtime Wall Street analyst Robert Willens explained to Barron's. ""A tender offer stands on the same footing as an actual acquisition when it comes to rights plans.""
So going with a tender would be a bold move for Musk, given the rights plan.
Bloomberg reported Sunday that Oracle (ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison and private-equity firm Thoma Bravo could join with Musk and raise up to $50 billion. That's quite a war chest.
The $50 billion figure implies a much higher price for Twitter stock, about $72 a share. If the $50 billion is for all of Twitter, including, Musk's existing stake, the implied price is about $65 a share.
Twitter shares were above $70 as recently as this past summer.
Ellison is a Tesla directors. Musk's private jet was in Lanai, Hawaii, back in late January, according to a popular Twitter account that tracks his jet. Ellison owns most of that island.
Thoma Bravo isn't the only PE firm reportedly involved. Monday evening, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apollo Global Management (APO) was also interested in backing Musk—or someone else interested in the social media platform.
All of this doesn't mean a tender offer is coming. Musk could just decide to raise his bid and take the new price to the board for review.
The Musk-Twitter drama has been moving faster than the time it takes to tweet a meme. And Twitter shareholders are learning that when Musk is involved, anything is possible.
Investors still aren't sure what to do with all the drama. Twitter stock was up 3.2% in premarket trading Monday but slipped to a 1.1% loss after the market opened. The stock closed up 7.5%, near the highs of the day, at $48.45. The S&P 500 closed down slightly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%.

107,18-Apr-22,The Washington Post,Mr. Musk's bid for attention,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2651462987/BFD812D457A14912PQ/482?accountid=13946,"IF YOU can't join them, buy them. This is the philosophy billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk appears to have adopted as he launches a hostile takeover bid for the social media platform Twitter. Let's hope he doesn't succeed.
The Tesla chief executive announced on Thursday an offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share in cash, after declining a seat on the social media company's board. His proposed price has embedded in it an apparent reference to marijuana (the number 420 often refers to cannabis) - just like the last time he messed with markets and allegedly misled investors by declaring he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 a share. The juvenile display says all anyone needs to know about Mr. Musk's general attitude toward this acquisition: It is an opportunity for him to get attention, even if he doesn't end up getting his way. The substance of his ideas for the future of Twitter are worth some wariness on their own.
Mr. Musk has promised to make Twitter a ""platform for free speech around the globe."" This vision is more or less the same one now-departed CEO Jack Dorsey championed throughout his tenure, and especially in the platform's early days. But like its industry peers, Twitter has moved over time toward stricter rules. That isn't because executives have changed their views, but rather because they have learned some lessons after observing how their products can be abused to manipulate elections, or spread health misinformation, or harass people en masse.
Certainly, moderators sometimes make mistakes, and more transparency surrounding enforcement decisions is in order. But a broader backtracking would be an error. To protect speech at all costs and keep Twitter free of bots and spam, as Mr. Musk has said he would like to do, is almost impossible.
As objectionable as Mr. Musk's flippant attitude toward the challenges of balancing expression and safety has been his approach to the financial regulations that are supposed to govern his behavior. Mr. Musk could emerge richer from this spectacle even if his bid fails. But already, he might have made $156 million by gaming the legal requirements: The wealthiest man in the world was 11 days late in publicly declaring the acquisition of a large stake in Twitter and instead went on buying shares. This is only the latest episode in which Mr. Musk has shown disregard for the Securities and Exchange Commission; apparently, the investigation and resulting consent decree following his bluff about taking Tesla private were insufficient to tame him. By failing to discipline him this time, the agency will only further lose credibility.
All in all, amid his endless provocations and billionaire bluster, the most encouraging thing Mr. Musk has said about his Twitter ambitions is this: ""I am not sure that I will actually be able to acquire it.""

108,18-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),Would Elon Musk Allow Trump Back on Twitter? The Changes Ahead if He Wins Control.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2651673962/BFD812D457A14912PQ/630?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk wants to let virtually anyone say virtually anything on Twitter if he succeeds in buying the social media platform .
What that free-speech paradise would look like—and who would want to hang out there—is another question.
""If his answer is going to be, 'If it's legal, it stays up,' whatever he's building will be unmanageable and won't be useful to most users,"" said Matthew Feeney, director of the Project on Emerging Technologies at the Cato Institute, the libertarian think tank.
Hours after Musk disclosed his offer to pay $54.20 a share in a deal that would put Twitter under his private ownership , the Tesla CEO said during an interview at a TED conference in Vancouver Thursday that he aimed to recast Twitter as ""an inclusive arena for free speech.""
""Twitter has become kind of a de facto town square, so it's really important that people both have the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely, within the bounds of the law,"" he said.
His vision would run counter to recent moves by Twitter and other mainstream social media sites, including Meta Platforms' Facebook, to more aggressively police their properties for cases of online harassment, disinformation, and other speech deemed detrimental to public discourse.
Twitter attaches warning labels to tweets that contain misleading information about the coronavirus vaccine and has stopped content from official Russian government accounts from being recommended in timelines, notifications or elsewhere on the site as that country wages war in Ukraine.
After Donald Trump used Twitter to sow doubt about the legitimacy of his electoral defeat in the days surrounding the Jan. 6, 2021, mob attack on the U.S. Capitol building, the former president was permanently booted from the platform.
Musk, a prolific and sometimes controversial tweeter himself, appears to want to take the site in a more laissez-faire direction.
""My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,"" Musk said at the TED conference.
To some—especially those on the political left—that would be an unwelcome development.
""In the worst-case scenario, having Elon Musk successfully turn Twitter into the free-speech absolutist site he wants it to be could be pretty catastrophic for the information ecosystem,"" said Jesse Lehrich, a co-founder of the advocacy group Accountable Tech.
Lowering the guardrails on what users can and can't post would encourage falsehoods, propaganda and hate speech to proliferate among Twitter's hundreds of millions of users, many of whom depend on the platform as a primary source of news and information, Lehrich said.
Meanwhile, it was virtually certain that Trump would be invited back onto the site if Musk became its owner, Lehrich said.
Trump, for his part, said in an interview with Americano Media that aired Wednesday—after Musk had disclosed a 9.2% stake in the company, but before he said he planned to acquire the company outright—that he ""probably wouldn't have any interest"" in rejoining the platform.
If Trump did return to Twitter, it would clear the way for Facebook and Alphabet's YouTube to remove the former president from the blacklists they also placed him on in the days surrounding the January 2021 insurrection, Lehrich said.
""I don't think it's a stretch to say that could well change the outcome of the 2024 election,"" he said. ""This could be nothing at all. It could also be hugely consequential.""
Still, that degree of influence would depend on Twitter being able to retain—and grow—its existing user base under a new, more libertarian regime, which some don't see as a certainty.
""It's one thing to say Donald Trump should be online. That's a long way from beheading videos and animals being crushed to death,"" said Cato's Feeney. ""It's a little too flippant and unrealistic to say, 'Anything goes.'""
Phil Napoli, director of the DeWitt Wallace Center for Media and Democracy at Duke University, said there are already corners of the internet that offer venues for unfettered expression, but they don't seem to be drawing a critical mass of users.
The Parler platform places few restrictions on its posts, but it has failed to claim much of the social-media market, while Trump's own proposed Truth Social platform appears to be struggling to get off the ground, Napoli said.
""When these places try to put this sort of libertarian platform model into effect, it devolves pretty quickly and it's not entirely clear that's a recipe for growth or sustainability,"" he said.
Yet, Napoli said, ""Elon Musk may be in a position where it's something he's able to subsidize and take a loss on if it's something he feels that strongly about.""
Indeed, Musk, the world's richest person, said at the TED conference that he doesn't ""care about the economics at all"" regarding his bid for Twitter.
""This is not a way to make money,"" he said.

 Would Elon Musk Allow Trump Back on Twitter? The Changes Ahead if He Wins Control.

109,18-Apr-22,Tallahassee Democrat,Elon Musk eyes Twitter takeover,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2651569761/BFD812D457A14912PQ/688?accountid=13946,"After becoming Twitter's top shareholder with a 9.2% stake last week, it was announced that Elon Musk would join the company's board of directors. However, later that same week, Twitter's chief executive, Parag Agrawal, tweeted that the situation had changed and Musk would not be joining the board after all.
It was clear that Musk viewed the spot on Twitter's board as merely a ceremonial position in which he would no longer be able to scrutinize the brand and would be ultimately unable to achieve his grand ambitions for drastic change within the company; he wanted more.
Refusing to be upstaged by Oscars slap discourse or news of the soured deal, Elon Musk emerged from deep in the heart of Texas, consulted with his team of surely beleaguered financial advisers and took to his personal Twitter account, announcing his intentions to buy the platform outright. In a letter to the company's chair, Musk said, ""I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy.""
Musk submitted a generous cash offer of $54.20 per share of the company totaling $43 billion. In his SEC filing, citing his reason for brokering a buyout, Musk said that ""Twitter has extraordinary potential. I will unlock it."" Rather than utilizing his extraordinary wealth to assist the world's most at-risk populations, Musk has decidedly dedicated his fortune and intellect to fund space adventures, the creation of Tesla-brand robots and neural implants. Now, he's taken over one of the largest social media companies in the world, seizing the means of mass communication for his own personal gain. The global super-villain ramifications should not be lost on us all.
While Musk has been outspoken in favor of radically displacing the ""power"" in social media from wealthy conglomerates back to the users who actively make the platforms what they are, he's hardly the digital Robin Hood as he would like to cast himself. Musk, at over 81 million followers on the platform, is not stealing Twitter from the rich to give to the ""poor"" –– the average Twitter user with follower counts ranging anywhere from zero to a few thousand –– but rather, stealing from the rich to give to himself... the rich. Think: Kanye West upstaging Taylor Swift at the 2009 VMAs, but instead of stepping in to give props to Beyoncé, he up and snatched the award for himself.
Musk's mission of bringing free speech back to Twitter has especially resonated with prominent conservatives in media and politics, who saw a handful of high-profile figureheads vanquished from the site for posting persistent inflammatory and, at times, completely unfounded claim. The most notably of which was former President Donald Trump, who was de-platformed early last year following the Jan. 6 Insurrection due to the ""risk of further incitement of violence"" associated with his repeated use of Twitter to spread flagrant lies about the 2020 presidential election. This exile led to many loyalists characterizing the company as ""ultra-woke"" and selectively curating its unique definition of free speech in line with a leftist agenda, a characterization that Musk seems to have adopted to a certain extent.
After being banished from the app, Trumpworld turned to a series of failed social media ventures, the likes of Gettr, Parler, Rumble and, now, an app of Trump's own design, Truth Social. Where Twitter differs from its decoys, however, is its sense of unity within disunity. It is, as Musk described, the ""de facto public town square"" of the internet, but much like a small municipality, it has rules by which even the richest citizens must abide.
In a calculated attempt to fend off Musk's bid, Twitter released a ""poison pill"" which would flood the market with new shares if Musk were to buy more than a 15% stake in the company. The counter-measure indicates the Twitter higher-ups' reluctance to allow control of the platform to fall into Musk's volatile hands. Musk has, however, stated that he has a ""Plan B"" failsafe handy in the event his initial bid fell through, and we can expect to learn more about this next move as his initial ploy has hit turbulence.

110,19-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Says Twitter's Board Owns Almost No Stock. How It Compares to Tesla and Others.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2652020589/BFD812D457A14912PQ/145?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk questioned Twitter directors' alignment with shareholders over the weekend, citing most of the board's small personal stakes in the social media company. The entrepreneur and world's richest person offered to acquire Twitter in its entirety last week, to which the company's board responded with a poison pill defense .
""Wow, with Jack departing, the Twitter (ticker: TWTR) board collectively owns almost no shares!"" Musk tweeted on Saturday . ""Objectively, their economic interests are simply not aligned with shareholders.""
Some research has shown that companies whose board members own relatively more stock outperform those whose directors have less of a stake in the business. That conclusion certainly makes objective sense : A greater financial incentive should translate to more effort put in by a board member to make their company successful, assuming they are qualified and capable of serving in the role.
On the other hand, there is also value to having independent voices on a board and directors who don't have a long history with a company. Call it a fresh perspective. They might be granted shares when they join a company or—even better—purchase them with their own cash.
Directors are also compensated handsomely for being on a board, typically with a combination of cash and shares and restricted stock units, or RSUs. Their holdings should grow the longer they sit on a board.
In Twitter's case, directors are granted $225,000 of restricted stock units, plus at least $50,000 in cash, annually.
The table below lists Twitter's board members and their respective positions in the company, based on the company's latest proxy statement or individual directors' financial disclosures, whichever are more recent. The stakes may include both common shares and RSUs.
As Musk pointed out, the vast majority of the Twitter board's ownership is in the hands of co-founder Jack Dorsey—some 2.4% of the company—versus about 2.6% owned by the entire board, including Dorsey.
Tesla (TSLA), which holds its annual meeting in the fall, last issued a proxy statement with board members' ownership in August 2021, based on their holdings at the end of June. Some directors have disclosed transactions since then, including a flurry of sales in December by Musk. Below are Tesla's directors' stakes in the company when including their RSUs.
Unsurprisingly, Musk dominates the cap table, with common shares representing about 17% of the company and options that would take his ownership to about 23.5% when exercised. Oracle (ORCL) co-founder and early Tesla believer Larry Ellison is next, with a roughly 1.5% stake. Tesla's remaining six directors own about 0.3% of the company combined.
In percentage terms, that is not so different from Twitter's board. But it's of a much, much more valuable company—Tesla director Hiromichi Mizuno's 0.01% ownership of the company is worth more than $100 million, versus Twitter director David Rosenblatt's similarly sized stake worth some $5 million.
And Mizuno is the least invested in Tesla of the company's board. At Twitter, seven of 11 directors have stakes of less than 0.01% of the company.
Barron's examined the board of directors' ownership stakes in several major large-cap tech companies, including Facebook parent Meta Platforms (FB), Apple (AAPL), Salesforce (CRM), and PayPal Holdings (PYPL).
In the majority of cases, founders held the vast majority of shares among directors, some early and long-term investors had decently large stakes, and newer, independent directors barely registered on the cap table. Companies without founders on their boards might have very little board ownership—all of PayPal's directors combined hold less than 0.1% of the company's shares.
That makes Twitter's low board ownership the rule, rather than the exception. Musk raised a fair point with his tweet—but one that is applicable to most major tech companies on the market, not just Twitter.

111,19-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Twitter Stock Swings Sharply as Individual Investors Pile In; Social-media company's shares on track for best month since February 2021,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2652187803/BFD812D457A14912PQ/269?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk's bid to buy Twitter Inc. has triggered a frenzy in the company's shares and options.
The social-media company's stock has been on a head-spinning ride since the Tesla Inc. chief executive took a stake in the company and said he was angling to take it private in a $43 billion deal . The shares, which were trading below $40 before he disclosed his position, jumped 27% in a single session on the news.
Twitter shares have since swung wildly, including Monday's 7.5% jump. Although they pulled back Tuesday, slipping 4.7% to $46.16, they remain on track for their best month since February 2021.
Twitter responded to Mr. Musk's approach by implementing a poison pill , a legal maneuver that makes it difficult for shareholders to build their stakes beyond a set point. Other potential suitors are also circling the company.
The social-media company's fate remains uncertain, but that hasn't kept individual investors and options traders from piling in.
""Twitter has been a favorite among retail investors since Elon Musk"" became involved, said Lucas Mantle, a data-science analyst at Vanda Research.
Purchases of the shares by individual investors in April have swelled to around 11 times the monthly average since 2020, according to the firm.
Twitter shares on Monday were the second-most popular among investors on retail brokerage Fidelity, with roughly an equal number of buy and sell orders, according to the brokerage's website. Their popularity trailed only Tesla's.
The big one-day moves in Twitter's shares are reminiscent of the swings that have become a feature of the meteoric ascent in Tesla's shares over the past two years. The electric-vehicle maker has often logged giant one-day swings as momentum-driven traders have piled into the stock.
""We don't think it's fundamentally driven,"" said Brian Fitzgerald, senior equity analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, of the rally in Twitter shares.
Mr. Musk's move to take Twitter private has defied conventions and largely played out over the social-media platform. Some investors may be piling into the shares in hopes of an eventual deal, he said. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Apollo Global Management Inc. is also considering participating in a bid for Twitter .
""I've never seen this before,"" Mr. Fitzgerald said of the drama that has played out between Mr. Musk and Twitter.
Some of the most actively traded options tied to Twitter in recent sessions have been call options that would pay out if the shares jumped to $50 or $55, according to Cboe Global Markets data. Calls give the right to buy shares at a specific price, by a stated date. Puts give the right to sell.
There may be more volatility for both stocks ahead of their earnings reports this month. Tesla reports Wednesday, while Twitter follows later in the month.
Options on Tesla—a favorite among derivatives traders—have also been popular ahead of the company's results. Calls tied to the shares jumping to $1,100 and $1,050 have been widely traded. Also in the mix: calls tied to the shares jumping to $1,200. The shares closed Tuesday at $1,028.15.
Still, some traders have opted to avoid both companies in recent sessions, deeming the situation too unpredictable.
""The key takeaway is that they would rather not touch it,"" said Amy Wu Silverman, a managing director at RBC Capital Markets, of some of her clients. ""It becomes a challenging situation.""

It turns out the brief shutdown of Tesla’s Gigafactory Shanghai in March didn’t put much of a dent in the company’s financial results for the three months ending March 31. But the April portion of Giga Shanghai’s production halt and the lingering effect of Shanghai’s Covid-19 lockdown will likely show their impact in the coming weeks and take a toll on Tesla’s next quarter’s earnings.
The electric carmaker reported a record quarterly profit of $3.3 billion on $18.8 billion in sales on April 20, far exceeding Wall Street’s expectation of $2.2 billion in profit on $17.7 billion in sales. Quarterly profit jumped 650 percent from a year ago, representing an exponential growth path since Tesla first turned a profit in Q4 2019.
In the first three months of 2022, Tesla delivered just over 310,000 electric vehicles globally, up 68 percent from last year. About 95 percent of those vehicles were Model 3 and Model Y. The higher-end Model S and Model X accounted for the rest.
Tesla produced about 5,000 fewer vehicles than it delivered during the first quarter, making up for the difference from an inventory of already made cars. One possible explanation for the shortfall was a six-day shutdown at Giga Shanghai in March as a result of local Covid lockdown.
The shutdown extended nearly three weeks into April, and the factory only restarted operations this week with about half the staff. Its inventory of parts and components can last only two weeks based on production schedule. With most of the Shanghai city and its surrounding areas still under lockdown, it could take Tesla weeks to get its supply chain back to full speed.
“We did lose a lot of important days of production. There were also a lot of supplier challengers,” CEO Elon Musk told investors during a call on April 20. He expects Tesla’s total second quarter output to be similar, or possibly slightly lower, than that of the first as a result of reduced production in Shanghai.
Giga Shanghai is Tesla’s most productive factory in the world. In normal times, it operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week using three shifts of workers and produces 2,000 vehicles a day for Asian and European markets. Investment bank Credit Suisse estimates the Shanghai lockdown could reduce Tesla’s second-quarter output by roughly 90,000 vehicles."
113,20-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk Hints at Twitter Tender Offer With Cryptic Tweet; Tesla chief tweets '_______ is the Night,' a possible reference to F. Scott Fitzgerald novel 'Tender Is the Night'",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2652577395/BFD812D457A14912PQ/52?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk raised the prospect of launching a tender offer to acquire Twitter Inc. in a cryptic tweet following his $43 billion offer last week to acquire the social-media platform.
Mr. Musk, Tesla Inc.'s chief executive, tweeted a blank space followed by the words ""is the Night ,"" late Tuesday Eastern time. Speculation grew that the message was a veiled reference to the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel ""Tender Is the Night"" and implied the world's richest man planned to approach Twitter shareholders directly to buy their stock at a specific price over a defined period.
Mr. Musk's latest tweet is his second in less than a week to suggest the possibility of a pending tender offer for Twitter. Over the weekend, he tweeted ""Love Me Tender,"" the title of an Elvis Presley song.
Other potential references could be to Rod Stewart's song ""Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright),"" signaling an offer is coming soon. Neil Young also released a 1975 album and single titled ""Tonight's the Night."" The tweet's date, April 20, is the unofficial annual cannabis day, also known by some on Twitter as Elon Musk Day, another indication he has something planned for Wednesday.
Twitter has said that it would review Mr. Musk's takeover proposal. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that the company is expected to rebuff the offer. Twitter has also adopted a so-called poison pill, hindering Mr. Musk's ability to increase his stake in the company beyond 15%.
The poison pill is meant to give Twitter's board power to guard against an unwanted takeover bid that it believes isn't in the best interest of shareholders.
By taking the bid directly to Twitter investors in a tender offer, Mr. Musk could pressure the board to withdraw opposition and its poison pill if he garnered enough shareholder support. But that is far from certain.
Twitter's stock traded close to $46 Wednesday, below Mr. Musk's offer price of $54.20, which he has said is his best and final. Mr. Musk has said he has ""sufficient assets"" to consummate the deal, but his formal offer lacked detail on any financing.
Apollo Global Management Inc. is considering participating in a bid for Twitter , including with Mr. Musk, the Journal reported.

 Elon Musk Hints at Twitter Tender Offer With Cryptic Tweet 
Credit: By Ben Dummett "
114,20-Apr-22,Los Angeles Times,"BUSINESS; NEWS ANALYSIS; Musk's pledges contrast with his record; He says he'd bring free speech, transparency to Twitter, but they're both lacking at Tesla.",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2652445991/BFD812D457A14912PQ/233?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk might be serious about taking over Twitter. Or his hostile bid might be just a rich man's whim, a distraction he'll abandon when it begins to bore him. Or maybe he's punking everybody.
Because it's Elon Musk, it's hard to tell. Yes, he transformed the automobile industry with electric-car maker Tesla. His rocket ship company, SpaceX, reinvigorated an industry long dominated by plodding defense contractors such as Lockheed and Boeing. Remarkable accomplishments both.
But he's been sued for defamation, defended himself by saying no one takes him literally and fined by the government for making fraudulent business claims. On Twitter, where he regales his 80 million followers with a 24/7 stream of pure Musk, he's fashioned himself into a jokester, a provocateur, and, when the mood suits him, a clown.

In literary terms, he's what you'd call an unreliable narrator.
In his bid to buy Twitter, he opened with a flourish that suggested levity, working the number ""420"" into his proffered share price. The weed joke evidently fell flat: The board created a ""poison pill"" provision to deter him.
Now, in need of support from shareholders and potential financiers, he has turned to rhetoric, laying out a grand if fuzzy vision for the Twitter he would build.
Calling himself a ""free speech absolutist,"" he said he wants to make the social network what he regards as a friendlier place for free expression by ""being cautious about"" permanent bans and loosening its content restrictions. ""A social media platform's policies are good if the most extreme 10% on left and right are equally unhappy,"" he tweeted Tuesday.
He also said he would make Twitter transparent about its inner workings, open-sourcing the algorithm it uses to sort and amplify tweets so it's no longer a ""black box.""
How seriously should such talk be taken? Rather than try to parse his words -- always a fool's errand -- perhaps it's best to answer that by looking back at his record as a chief executive.
Start with transparency. According to Musk, Twitter posts are ""mysteriously promoted or demoted with no insight into what's going on"" and who or what is making the decisions. ""Having a black box algorithm promote some things and not other things, I think this can be quite dangerous,"" he said at the TED conference last week. He suggested posting Twitter code on the open source developer site GitHub.
There's some irony around Musk's critical use of the term ""black box."" Tesla has its own algorithmic black box in its cars -- the one responsible for automated driving.
Like Twitter's algorithms, the code governing the operation of Teslas in Autopilot or Full Self-Driving mode is private and proprietary. That has made it difficult for regulators to understand the specific failures that have led to Teslas steering themselves into parked emergency vehicles, running down railroad tracks, confusing the moon for a traffic signal yellow light and other documented mistakes.
Also closely guarded are Tesla's data on Autopilot injuries and fatalities. Musk says cars driven on Autopilot are safer than those driven by human drivers, but he has never served up the proof. University researchers have offered to evaluate the data while keeping it shielded from public view. Musk has never responded to their offers.
""We would like him to be a little more transparent with respect to the safety of his Teslas,"" said Alain Kornhauser, who heads the autonomous vehicle program at Princeton University. ""A lot of us think they're safe. We'd like to do an independent evaluation and offer a second opinion. I think it would help him and help the world.""
To get details on a car's performance before and after a crash, Tesla owners, police and lawyers have had to have a subpoena issued to compel the company to share data.
Musk has also bristled at the transparency requirements that come with being a public company CEO, time and again directing taunts and vitriol at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which is charged with regulating securities markets and protecting investors. In one profane tweet, he suggested that the E in SEC stands for ""Elon's,"" a message universally interpreted as an invitation to the agency to perform a sex act on the mega-billionaire.
In the buildup to his Twitter bid, Musk was still thumbing his nose at the agency, dragging his feet in filing a mandatory disclosure form announcing his purchase of a stake greater than 5%. That led to a lawsuit accusing him of ripping off other investors and pocketing the gains by building up his stake still further before the news broke, sending the share price up. Meanwhile, he's back in court trying to overturn a 2018 settlement with the SEC on fraud charges.
Musk did not reply to requests for comment. Almost alone among major public companies, Tesla does not have a media relations department.
Then there's the question of Musk's alleged free-speech absolutism. When it comes to the speech of others, particularly his employees and critics, his commitment has been anything but absolute. Far from defending their right to speak up, he has sought to stifle them with legal muzzles or responded with firings, lawsuits or even the hiring of private detectives.
Cristina Balan, who raised alarms about vehicle safety while working as an engineer at Tesla, is one of several whistleblowers who has encountered Musk's wrath after going public. Shortly after scheduling a meeting with Musk to make her case, she was fired, and the company began slipping false information about her to a reporter. Balan's defamation case against Tesla is still in the courts. ""Musk is an absolutist about absolutism, which is the exact opposite of free speech,"" Balan told The Times.
Although many companies press employees to sign nondisclosure agreements, Tesla has been a particularly profligate user of them, and of arbitration agreements that prevent those suing the company from making their allegations part of the public record. Tesla requires customers testing its Full Self-Driving technology to sign nondisclosure agreements that say they should ""selectively"" choose what they post to YouTube because ""there are a lot of people that want Tesla to fail.""
Even employees who think they're playing by the rules may find themselves on the wrong side of Musk's cone of silence. A member of Tesla's automated driving team posted videos that showed Tesla's Full Self-Driving feature working well in some ways and needing improvement in others. Although the videos contained no nonpublic information, he was fired.
Critics outside the company are hardly immune. When Tesla ran into image problems in China, the company responded by asking the Chinese government to censor critical posts by social media users there, Bloomberg reported last year.
Musk's vendetta against Vernon Unsworth was more personal. When the cave rescue diver told a TV interviewer that Musk was only getting in the way with his plan to rescue Thai children stuck in a flooded cave using a miniature submarine, Musk called the man a ""pedo"" -- or pedophile -- on Twitter. (The children were rescued by other means.) Musk hired a private investigator to try to prove his accusation and called the man a ""child rapist"" in an email to a BuzzFeed reporter.
Unsworth sued for defamation but lost the case at trial, with Musk's lawyers successfully arguing that a reasonable person would not take the content of his tweets literally.
Musk ""is willing to go to great lengths to punish or retaliate against people who speak ill of him,"" said Ed Niedermeyer, who struggled to find sources to talk to him, even off the record, for his book on Tesla, ""Ludicrous."" Sources who did contact Niedermeyer, the writer said, emphasized that ""Elon Musk is not a guy you want to cross."" One source, Niedermeyer said, told him Musk ""is like a wild animal when he's cornered.""
Musk sometimes paints a bull's-eye on journalists who report negative news about Tesla. He once accused Business Insider reporter Linette Lopez of using inside information to benefit short sellers who were betting against Tesla. Insider trading is a crime sometimes enforced by the SEC.
""From the moment Musk made up lies about me to this very day I have an angry mob of his fans, mostly men, following me around the internet,"" Lopez told The Times via email. ""They comment about everything from my professional work to my physical appearance. Their attacks don't have to be true or make sense. Musk's mob is like an extension of his ego. They join him in whatever fantasy world he wants to live in, they are very aggressive about trying to enforce his reality no matter how warped it is.""
It may be that Musk, if his long-shot pursuit of Twitter comes to fruition, prioritizes unfettered speech and transparency for its users and employees. If so, it will be a departure from the way he has operated to date.

115,20-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Isn't Going Away if Twitter Rejects Him. Here's What He Might Pay.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2652574976/BFD812D457A14912PQ/364?accountid=13946,"Even if the Twitter board rejects Tesla CEO Elon Musk's offer to buy the social-media platform, he won't go away immediately. There is more drama to come. Elvis Presley has something to do with it.
Musk tweeted out a lyric from the Presley hit Love Me Tender on Saturday. That isn't much of a tell, but following the Tesla (ticker: TSLA) CEO requires a master's degree in Twitter-ology.
(He also tweeted out ""_________ is the night"" late Tuesday. Tender is the Night is a novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald. That's another possible 'tender' reference, but Tesla also reports first-quarter earnings Wednesday evening.)
It is understandable if longtime Musk followers come to the conclusion that the Love Me Tender tweet isn't innocent. And many of the 30,000-plus comments received as of Monday morning refer to Musk's potential takeover of Twitter (TWTR). There are also comments asking for a car as well as bots pushing cryptocurrencies.
Musk didn't reply to a Barron's question attached to the original tweet.
In his communication to the Twitter board offering to buy the company, Musk indicated that $54.20 a share was his best and final takeover offer, saying that if the board didn't accept it, Musk was likely to sell his stock.
""If the deal doesn't work, given that I don't have confidence in management nor do I believe I can drive the necessary change in the public market, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder,"" reads his April 13 correspondence.
Those statements look like more of a negotiating tactic in light of the Saturday tweet. A tender offer, as in Love Me Tender, is the next level in a hostile bid for a company. It bypasses a board of directors and appeals directly to shareholders to tender , or sell their stock, to the bidder at a set price.
The trick with this tender is that Twitter adopted a shareholder rights plan, more commonly known as a poison pill, on Friday, the day before Musk's ""tender"" tweet. Rights plans are designed to thwart hostile bids by giving everyone but the unwelcome bidder the right to buy stock. It makes acquiring a company more expensive.
""A triggering event, for poison pill purposes, is either a tender offer for, or an actual acquisition of, the requisite percentage of the corporation's stock,"" accounting expert and longtime Wall Street analyst Robert Willens explained to Barron's. ""A tender offer stands on the same footing as an actual acquisition when it comes to rights plans.""
So going with a tender would be a bold move for Musk, given the rights plan.
Bloomberg reported Sunday that Oracle (ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison and private-equity firm Thoma Bravo could join with Musk and raise up to $50 billion. That's quite a war chest.
The $50 billion figure implies a much higher price for Twitter stock, about $72 a share. If the $50 billion is for all of Twitter, including, Musk's existing stake, the implied price is about $65 a share.
Twitter shares were above $70 as recently as this past summer.
Ellison is a Tesla directors. Musk's private jet was in Lanai, Hawaii, back in late January, according to a popular Twitter account that tracks his jet. Ellison owns most of that island.
Thoma Bravo isn't the only PE firm reportedly involved. Monday evening, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apollo Global Management (APO) was also interested in backing Musk—or someone else interested in the social media platform.
All of this doesn't mean a tender offer is coming. Musk could just decide to raise his bid and take the new price to the board for review.
The Musk-Twitter drama has been moving faster than the time it takes to tweet a meme. And Twitter shareholders are learning that when Musk is involved, anything is possible.
Investors still aren't sure what to do with all the drama. Twitter stock was up 3.2% in premarket trading Monday, the day after the Elvis-themed tweet, but slipped to a 1.1% loss after the market opened. The stock closed up 7.5%, near the highs of the day, at $48.45. The S&P 500 closed down slightly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1%.
In premarket trading Wednesday, the shares were up 1.5% at $46.86.

116,21-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla's Stellar Earnings Show the Challenge Jerome Powell Is Facing,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2652827268/BFD812D457A14912PQ/31?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has bigger challenges ahead than rocketing inflation. Tesla's quarterly earnings beat was driven by the car maker's ability to pass on rising costs to eager customers. It shone through in an operating margin of 19.2%, which has swollen from 5.7% a year ago.
The price increases jar with Musk's ambition to make electric vehicles as affordable as possible. But after sustaining longtime losses, who can blame him?
Its growing order backlog means Tesla must think ahead. With some suppliers asking for 20%-30% increases for parts, Musk believes inflation could be higher than the stated 8.5%.
However, high-spending consumers are so far not being put off their favorite brands, regardless of cost.
High-end fashion house LVMH, where price increases, according to HSBC estimates , have been in the 20%-23% range at Louis Vuitton and Tiffany, enjoyed a strong start to the year despite China disruption.
Loyalty to cheaper goods is also in evidence. Nestlé—home to Purina pet food and Starbucks packaged coffee—on Thursday reported 7.6% organic sales growth in the quarter, supported with price hikes accounting for 5.2%. CEO Mark Schneider cautioned there were more rises to come.
Procter & Gamble pulled off a similar trick , with its largest division—fabric and home care—powering organic sales 10% higher, helped by 5% from price gains. But for how long?
Despite their very different sticker prices, Tesla's market position looks stronger than a brand such as P&G's Tide detergent.
With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sure to address the path of interest rates rises when he speaks at the International Monetary Fund later, investors would do well to remain in the lap of luxury.

Tesla's Shares Climb After Record Q1 Earnings, Sales
Tesla beat first-quarter expectations, reporting how it beat inflation by substituting materials and focusing on manufacturing. Tesla's shares climbed 5.3% in late trading after dropping nearly 5% during the regular session.
* Tesla reported $3.22 per share from $18.8 billion in sales, its highest total to date. Wall Street had expected earnings per share of $2.20 to $2.30 from $18 billion in sales. Operating profit of $3.6 billion also beat expectations, by $1 billion.
* Analysts expected earnings to dip in the quarter because the prices of the metals that go into electric-vehicle batteries had spiked more than 70%. But Tesla's manufacturing cost per car dropped, in part because Tesla installed iron-phosphate batteries that don't contain pricey cobalt or nickel in about half its vehicles.
* Ford Motor, General Motors, and Volkswagen are among competitors looking to take bites out of Tesla's 80% share of the U.S. EV market. ""More competition is coming,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Barron's, but Tesla's installed EV manufacturing base is multiples of other auto companies right now.
* A federal judge in California rejected a request from Tesla shareholders in a lawsuit to force CEO Elon Musk to stop talking about his 2018 tweets in which he said he had the funding to take Tesla private. Musk's lawyer said a gag order would trample Musk's free speech.
What's Next: Tesla said it expects to operate below capacity for the next few quarters, in part because its Shanghai factory temporarily closed last month during Covid-19 lockdowns. But it still expects to achieve an average annual growth rate of 50% in vehicle deliveries over the next several years.

United Expects to Be 'Solidly Profitable' in Q2 and 2022
United Airlines Holdings said it expects to be ""solidly profitable"" in the second quarter and for the 2022 calendar year despite some turbulence in the first three months. United reported a $1.4 billion net loss for the first quarter, and a 21% drop in total operating revenue compared with the first quarter of 2019.
* Despite a 19% decline in capacity and a 3% decrease in total revenue per available seat mile compared with the first quarter of 2019, United projected a 17% gain in revenue per seat in the second quarter over 2019—""the strongest second quarter revenue guidance in company history.""
* The Chicago-based carrier is seeing signs that business travel is ""rapidly returning"" and that international travel is picking up, including in Asia. ""The demand environment is the strongest it's been in my 30 years in the industry—and United and its customers will benefit more than any other airline,"" said United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby.
* Airline ticket prices rose 10.7% in March from February and are nearly 24% higher than a year ago, but travel demand is exceeding expectations. In the first quarter of 2022, travelers spent $21 billion purchasing domestic plane tickets, compared with $56 billion spent on airfares in all of 2021, MarketWatch reported.
* But fuel costs are also soaring. United paid $2.88 a gallon for fuel in the first quarter, 15% higher than the $2.51 per gallon cost executives forecast three months ago, and 40% more than in 2019. United expects fuel prices to climb to $3.43 per gallon in the second quarter.
What's Next: United said it opened United Aviate Academy in Goodyear, Ariz., with a goal of training 5,000 new pilots by 2030, expanded nonstop service to Cape Town, South Africa, and resumed 19 international routes.

Apple Store Workers Seek Company's First Vote to Unionize
Apple store workers in a mall near Atlanta filed for a union election with the National Labor Relations Board, and if the vote passes, they would become the first group of Apple workers to unionize.
* The Communications Workers of America represents the group, which includes sales staff, technicians, creative workers, and operations personnel. About 70% of the 100 employees eligible signed union authorization cards, the CWA said on Wednesday.
* Apple store workers earn a minimum hourly pay of $20, the company said, adding, ""We are pleased to offer very strong compensation and benefits for full-time and part-time employees.""
* Workers at Apple's store in New York City's Grand Central Terminal are collecting signatures for union authorization, an early step in the process. That group calls itself Fruit Stand Workers United and is working with Workers United, an affiliate of Service Employees International Union.
* CWA represents people in telecommunications, media, and tech, including workers at AT&T and Verizon retail stores. CWA said it worked with Verizon workers in Seattle who voted to unionize last week. The group has also worked with organizers at Google Fiber, Starbucks, and REI.
What's Next: The NLRB will have to decide if there is enough interest among workers at the store to hold a vote, with the minimum being 30%, and then it will set the terms for a vote, including whether it should be in person or by mail.

Bill Ackman Dumps Netflix Stock Months After Buying
Billionaire investor Bill Ackman was among the many sellers of Netflix stock on Wednesday, just three months after revealing his Pershing Square Capital had scooped up 3.1 million shares of the streaming service. Netflix shares plunged 35% in regular trading Wednesday—one day after revealing a drop in subscribers and a weak outlook for growth. They were down 0.49% in the premarket Thursday.
* Some on Wall Street thought that Netflix's plunge is a buying opportunity—particularly for the big money, value-oriented investor Ackman. Instead, he was a seller. It wasn't just the decline in subscribers that worried Ackman. It was also the increased uncertainty around Netflix's plans to get things back on course.
* The company plans to crack down on password sharing, which could be a smart long-term play, but is sure to irk customers who recently faced a rate increase. Netflix is also toying with the idea of allowing advertising on the platform—a move that could alienate customers used to uninterrupted viewing.
* ""While we believe these business model changes are sensible, it is extremely difficult to predict their impact on the company's long-term subscriber growth, future revenues, operating margins, and capital intensity,"" Ackman wrote in a letter to shareholders.
What's Next: Despite Wednesday's sale, Ackman still touted Netflix, writing ""we would not be surprised to see Netflix continue to be a highly successful company and an excellent investment from its current market value."" For now, it's just not an investment for Ackman.

Carvana Cites Uncertainties as Q1 Sales Fall Short
Carvana said industrywide and company-specific challenges affected its business in the first quarter, though the used-car seller believes it is picking up share in the market. Shares tumbled 21% in after-hours trading and then recovered .
* The company said in a letter to shareholders that the Omicron coronavirus variant and used-car prices affected the broader industry, while it experienced issues of its own. Sales volume didn't meet what it had planned, and ""the lower retail unit volume led to higher cost of goods sold per unit.""
* Carvana posted a net loss of $506 million compared with a loss of $82 million a year earlier. Its per-share loss of $2.89 compared with expectations for a $1.58 loss per share.
* The company cited a number of uncertainties, including high used-vehicle prices, rising interest rates and fuel prices, and other economic trends that could affect the used-car industry. Because of that, it wouldn't give near-term guidance for the rest of 2022.
* Carvana told shareholders that while the quarter was ""challenging,"" it sees an opportunity to improve the business in part because of weaknesses uncovered by the current environment.
What's Next: Carvana also announced a $1 billion stock sale . CEO Ernie Garcia and his father Ernest Garcia II want to buy up to $432 million of the offering. Carvana is also offering $1 billion of perpetual preferred stock and $2.27 billion in senior unsecured notes to qualified investors.

 Tesla's Stellar Earnings Show the Challenge Jerome Powell Is Facing

117,21-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk Could Make a Tender Offer for Twitter. What Does That Mean?The Tesla CEO has said he is exploring the route in his bid to acquire the social-media company,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2652891564/BFD812D457A14912PQ/130?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk's cryptic tweets have suggested he might escalate his $43 billion bid for Twitter by launching a tender offer to buy the social-media company. The tweets make apparent references to Elvis Presley's hit song ""Love Me Tender"" and F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel ""Tender Is the Night.""

Twitter is expected in the coming days to reject Mr. Musk's $54.20-a-share bid as too low. If that really was Mr. Musk's ""best and final"" offer, as he has said, a tender offer would be his next-best option. He has confirmed he is exploring that route.
Here is what to know about tender offers—and this possible one in particular.
What is a tender offer?
There are two ways to buy a publicly traded company. The simplest and most common is a board-approved merger. Talks start in secret, the two sides haggle and then arrive at a deal. Shareholders get to vote and it is an all-or-nothing affair: Typically with a simple majority, the buyer walks away with the entire company. If the vote fails, the buyer goes away empty-handed.
A tender offer instead makes a direct appeal to shareholders to sell—or tender—their shares at a specific price. It can be used in friendly deals, but its real value is to hostile bidders when the target company's board won't engage. Tender offers simply go around them.
And they aren't all or nothing. A buyer can bid for, say, just enough shares to cross 50%, thus seizing control. From there it could replace intransigent board members with friendlier ones, though in practice, it rarely gets that far. If a tender offer looks likely to succeed, reluctant boards tend to capitulate and negotiate a deal.
How would a tender offer for Twitter work?

Mr. Musk would, with some regulatory paperwork, announce the offer at a specific price. The offer has to remain on the table for at least 20 days.

Those documents would lay out the number of shares he is soliciting. If Mr. Musk, who owns more than 9% of Twitter, takes a bare-bones approach, he would seek another 41% or so.
Meanwhile, Twitter would have 10 days to make its own recommendation to shareholders regarding the tender offer—in this case, presumably that they not accept it.

If not enough shares are tendered, Mr. Musk could cancel the offer or amend the terms.
What about Twitter's poison pill?

Last week, Twitter threw up a roadblock to defang Mr. Musk, or at least hamper his pursuit while it reviews his offer: a so-called poison pill . This legal maneuver would, if Mr. Musk took his stake above 15%, dilute his ownership by offering discounted shares to every other investor.

So even if he receives adequate support for his tender offer, the pill makes actually buying those shares complicated.

Still, a successful tender offer would send a powerful signal to Twitter's directors, two of whom are up for re-election at the company's annual meeting currently set for May 25. There are no competing candidates, but directors don't like having shareholders vote against them en masse.

Mr. Musk could urge shareholders to vote against the two directors, Egon Durban and Patrick Pichette, in what would be a referendum on his bid, said Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP partner Andrew Freedman, who advises activist investors on campaigns.
What information would be included in a tender offer?
Tender offers typically include details that would guide shareholders' decision-making, such as where the money is coming from, any conditions attached to the offer and what the buyer plans to do with the company if it succeeds.
Mr. Musk has revealed $46.5 billion in committed financing, including more than $25 billion in debt commitments and $21 billion of equity from himself. His initial offer provided no details on financing, raising questions about his ability to fund it.
A tender offer also has to include details of any previous discussions between the buyer and the target. So it could flesh out a narrative that Mr. Musk hinted at when he included in a securities filing a few text messages that he sent to Twitter's chairman just before he went public with his bid.
Will Twitter shareholders support a tender offer?
It appears unlikely that many will at the current price, which is well below the more than $70 a share that Twitter traded at just last year. Some analysts have said Mr. Musk's offer undervalues Twitter and the stock has been trading well below the initial offer price, a sign of a lack of investor enthusiasm.
Still, Mr. Musk has threatened to sell his stake if he doesn't see a path to a deal, which would likely cause Twitter's share price to fall. And there is already a rout in tech stocks . Some investors might want to encourage him to stick around by tendering their shares, hoping he will be compelled to raise his price to win over the board.

Tesla is doing very well—so well you might wonder why it has been raising prices so aggressively.
The electric-vehicle pioneer on Wednesday reported yet another record quarter for profits, far ahead of analyst forecasts, despite delivering a similar number of cars to customers. The explanation is a combination of price increases and, given the backdrop of soaring commodity prices, surprisingly low inflation in its bill of materials. Teslas sold for an average price of about $52,200—up 2.9% compared with the fourth quarter—while their average cost rose 1.7% to $36,500.
Factoring in extra revenues from regulatory credits and head-office costs such as research and development, the operating margin came in at 19.2%, up from just under 15% in the second half of last year. Most car makers give themselves a round of applause when they get into double digits. Tesla shares rose 5% in aftermarket trading.
Such results are evidence of the strength of Tesla's brand and manufacturing capabilities now that they are running at scale, but they also raise questions about the company's strategy. What will it do with the cash? And can a company built on the promise of affordable EVs continue to raise prices and make margins beyond the wildest dreams of its peers?
Some answers might come in Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk's highly anticipated ""Master Plan Part 3."" He tweeted last month that this was in the works in response to a Bloomberg article pointing out that his initial Master Plan to make affordable family-oriented EVs, laid out in a 2006 blog post, remains unfinished business. It clearly touched a nerve.
It is becoming clear that Mr. Musk's new affordability pitch will revolve around robotaxis for fleet use rather than EVs for individual sale. He said earlier this month that Tesla was working on a robotaxi project, and added on a call to discuss Wednesday's results that it would hold a robotaxi event next year with an ambition to launch volume production in 2024. This is after he said three months ago Tesla wasn't ""currently working on"" a much-discussed $25,000 model.
The logic of robotaxis is that they can be expensive to make but cheap to ride, due to heavy use that makes the most of an EV's low running costs. The batteries could potentially also be smaller than in cars optimized for personal use, because they wouldn't stray beyond a fixed geographic area. Robotaxi rides would cost less than a subsidized subway or bus ticket, Mr. Musk claimed Wednesday.
Building robotaxi fleets also requires a vast amount of capital, as Alphabet's Waymo and General Motors' Cruise have discovered. This could be a future use for Tesla's cash flows.
Mr. Musk addressed the awkward conjunction of substantial price increases and record margins by saying that, given Tesla's long waiting lists, the prices it is charging now need to anticipate raw-material inflation over the coming six to 12 months. He also pointed out that the company faces no shortage of demand.
Fair enough, but now Tesla's promise of mass-market electric mobility seems to hinge on a technology that has proven extremely hard to perfect. The company's project timelines have a long history of being extended, none more so than its efforts to make cars driverless. The year 2024 could again prove an optimistic delivery date.
Tesla's tech-star valuation has long depended on its cracking this nut, to which it has a different approach to almost everyone else, spurning the standard lidar perception technology in favor of cameras alone. Now its corporate mission to ""accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy"" is pointing down the same road. It better not lead to a dead end.

Lars Niki/Corbis via Getty Images
Why is Elon Musk so confident he can buy Twitter?
Besides the well-known facts that Twitter is Musk’s favorite platform to share his thoughts on everything—sometimes sensitive business information—and that he is friends with the company’s founder, Jack Dorsey, Twitter also happens to be well within his budget. Twitter’s market cap is $34.4 billion, far less than that of Meta (formerly Facebook), for instance, which is worth $550 billion.
Musk is worth $273 billion, per Forbes’s estimate. Theoretically, he can afford to buy Twitter six times over for the$43 billion he offered, although, to actually pay for the deal, he will have to either sell or take out a loan against some Tesla shares to free up billions of cash.
Twitter’s bargain tag is a result of its somewhat uninspiring history. It was founded and taken public around the same time as Facebook. Both were considered pioneers of the social media age. However, they have over the years evolved into two vastly different companies, at least financially.
While Facebook’s market cap has increased more than six fold in the past decade, Twitter current share price is only 1 percent higher than the opening price on its first trading day in November 2013.
Twitter had an impressive start in its early years. The platform’s monthly active users surpassed the 100 million milestone in 2011 and quickly doubled to 200 million just a year later. But the growth stalled soon after that; it took Twitter six more years to attract another 100 million users. For comparison, Facebook had 2.5 billion monthly users at that time.
Twitter also never found a sustainable way to monetize its small audience. During its 16 years of existence, including eight as a public company, Twitter only had two profitable years (2018 and 2019).
One obvious culprit has been the company’s leadership, which historically has lacked consistency and focus. Dorsey, the public face of company, was famously an elusive CEO who seemed to value many other pursuits over the profitability of Twitter. In 2008, he was ousted by Evan Williams, a Twitter co-founder and board member, reportedly for frequently leaving work early to attend yoga and fashion design classes. Dorsey went on to found Square, a digital payment company, shortly after leaving Twitter while Williams took over as its new CEO.
Williams lasted only two years on the job and stepped down in 2010, citing his intention to focus on product strategy. He was replaced by Twitter’s then chief operating officer Dick Costolo. Costolo oversaw Twitter through its IPO but failed to bring the company into profitability. He resigned in June 2015 after years of heavy losses. Weeks later, Dorsey rejoined the company as CEO.
Under Dorsey’s second term, Twitter finally turned a profit in 2018 ($1.2 billion) and 2019 ($1.47 billion) but quickly lost momentum after the pandemic hit in 2020. Twitter reported a $1.14 billion loss that year and another $220 million in red ink in 2021.
Dorsey’s tenure ended in November 2021, when he resigned to focus on Square. He was replaced by Twitter’s then chief technology officer Parag Agrawal. Dorsey remained as a board director, along with 10 other members, including Agrawal.
Twitter’s board has so far resisted Musk’s “best and final” offer to buy the company and has put in a “poison pill,” or a shareholder rights plan, in a bid to fend him off. Musk is now teasing a tender offer directly at Twitter shareholders, asking them to name a price at which he would buy their shares. “It would be utterly indefensible not to put this offer to a shareholder vote. They own the company, not the board of directors,” the Tesla CEO tweeted on April 14.
Musk claims he has secured $46.5 billion in funding from a roster of investment banks, including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Barclays, to help finance the tender offer, according to a Securities and Exchange filing on April 21."

Take Tesla (ticker: TSLA). He covers the electric-vehicle company, but he also spends time on non-Tesla issues as one of the few analysts writing significant research on Elon Musk's privately held business enterprises.
Jonas has published several reports on SpaceX , some of which include detailed financial models for the space-based internet and launch services businesses. Friday, Jonas published a 49-page report about Musk's tunneling business aptly named The Boring Company , tying the Boring research back to Tesla.
The report follows a Wednesday announcement that Boring raised $675 million, bringing its private market valuation to about $5.7 billion. It's ""another expansion of the Muskonomy,"" wrote Jonas, noting Boring's valuation rose about sixfold, from less than $1 billion, based on the new mark.
""This valuation comes on the back of The Boring Company's Vegas Loop being approved by Clark County Commissioners in October,"" added the analyst. Boring envisions using tunnels for traffic, freight, and utilities to reduce congestion in cities.
The Boring Company has the capacity to dig about 600 miles of tunnels a year, according to Jonas, who estimates Boring's costs are about one one-hundredth that of traditional tunneling technology. But how does it help Tesla?
As Jonas pointed out, Musk plans to develop a robotaxi-specific vehicle without a steering wheel or pedals. ""We see tunnels as the ultimate controlled environment,"" wrote the analyst. ""To be clear, we believe [Tesla's] first L5 vehicle may be in a geofenced tunnel.""
L5 refers to Level 5 autonomous driving, the most advanced potential version, when the car does everything, all the time, in all situations. Current systems on the road, including Tesla's Full Self Driving, are Level 2 systems, which require constant supervision by a driver.
There might be synergies between Boring and Tesla, though that would be a long way off. Jonas doesn't expect thousands of miles of tunnels to be dug a year for more than a decade.
The prospects for Boring didn't lead him to change his target for Tesla's stock price. Jonas rates shares Buy and has a $1,300 price target , based on the sum of the business's parts. It's a different way of looking at the stock than the typical approach of valuing it at a multiple of per-share earnings or operating profit.
Jonas says Tesla's car business is worth $646 a share, while he thinks its autonomous-driving software and future robotaxi business are worth about $479 a share. Then there are the energy, battery supply, and insurance businesses, worth $71, $62, and $42 a share, respectively.
In the Muskonomy, there is always a lot going on. ""While sea-changes in infrastructure may take years to play out, we would pay close attention to the next stages of The Boring Company,"" Jonas wrote.
Tesla investors probably will. Early Friday, Tesla stock was up about 4.1% for the week, partly because the company's first-quarter earnings were better than expected. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index were down about 0.8% and 1.8%, respectively.

123,22-Apr-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Musk Details Plan to Raise $46.5 Billion In Twitter Bid: [Business/Financial Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2653072214/BFD812D457A14912PQ/350?accountid=13946,"Mr. Musk has been building a stake in the social media company and last week made an unsolicited offer to acquire it outright.Elon Musk said on Thursday that he had commitments worth $46.5 billion to finance his proposed bid for Twitter and was exploring whether to launch a hostile takeover for the social media company.In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission dated Wednesday, the world's richest man said he planned to finance the bid with a mix of debt and cash. The investment bank Morgan Stanley and a group of other lenders are offering $13 billion in debt financing and another $12.5 billion in loans against Mr. Musk's stock in Tesla, the electric carmaker that he runs. He is expected to add about $21 billion in equity financing.The financial commitments, gathered a week after Mr. Musk made an unsolicited offer for Twitter, put pressure on the social media company's board to take his advances seriously. Mr. Musk's original offer had scant financing details and was received skeptically by Wall Street. Twitter then enacted a ""poison pill,"" a defensive maneuver that would prevent Mr. Musk from accumulating an unlimited number of the company's shares.But Mr. Musk, who has said he wants to take Twitter private and people to be able to speak more freely on the service, moved swiftly to secure financing for his bid. That shows how intent he is in his mission to buy Twitter -- at least for now.""It's serious,"" Steven Davidoff Solomon, a professor at the School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, said of the new filing. ""He's getting more professional and this is starting to look more like a normal hostile bid. You don't do that unless you're going to launch an offer.""In a tender offer, otherwise known as a hostile bid, Mr. Musk would take his bid directly to Twitter shareholders without the consent of the company's board. While Mr. Musk has not publicly outlined a business plan for Twitter under his ownership, he offered a glimpse of what he might do on Thursday.""If our twitter bid succeeds, we will defeat the spam bots or die trying!"" Mr. Musk tweeted. He has more than 82.5 million followers on Twitter and has been a heavy user of the service.Mr. Musk responded to an emailed request for comment by writing, ""X.""A Twitter spokesman confirmed that the company had received Mr. Musk's updated proposal and reiterated that its board was ""committed to conducting a careful, comprehensive and deliberate review to determine the course of action"" that would be best for the company and its shareholders.Twitter is likely to address Mr. Musk's bid in more detail when the San Francisco-based company reports quarterly earnings next Thursday. Those results may also offer investors key clues as to whether Mr. Musk's offer of $54.20 a share for the company is sufficient.Several analysts have said they expected Twitter's board to accept only a bid that valued it at a minimum of $60 a share. Twitter's stock rose above $70 a share last year when the company announced goals to double its revenue, but has since fallen to around $45 as investors have questioned its ability to meet those targets.Any hostile bid would face significant challenges. If Mr. Musk buys more than 15 percent of the company, Twitter could enact the poison pill and flood the market with new stock that all shareholders, except Mr. Musk, could buy at a discount. Mr. Musk has built up a stake of more than 9 percent of Twitter, which at one point made him the company's biggest shareholder.The poison pill that Twitter announced also has a ""last look"" provision. That would give the company a 10-day window to negotiate with any buyer, such as Mr. Musk, before it decided to trigger the poison pill. It is very rare for a potential acquirer to trigger a poison pill, but Mr. Musk is famously unpredictable.He said in Thursday's filing that he would continue to review his investment in Twitter, which could mean buying -- or selling -- more shares.Even with the commitments from banks, financing for the bid remains far from buttoned up. Mr. Musk said in the filing that banks had promised to lend money to him, though the ultimate form of their lending may change. The filing noted that the $12.5 billion loan against his Tesla stock might decrease in size but not increase. Analysts have said the banks offering loans on Tesla stock face risk, given the stock's volatility.Key to Mr. Musk's bid will be the $21 billion in equity financing, the details of which he has yet to outline. Analysts have questioned whether Mr. Musk would be willing to put up the cash on his own. And private equity firms are wary of getting involved in the battle, The New York Times previously reported, potentially ruling out a number of partners.""Real simply, who will be willing to cut 10- and 11-figure checks to participate in Elon's Big Adventure if that adventure is going to be a bare knuckles brawl,"" Don Bilson, an analyst at the research firm Gordon Haskett, wrote this week. ""The setup at this point doesn't look very promising for Musk so long as he isn't personally willing to add more to the pot and is determined to go the hostile route.""The 50-year-old billionaire has hinted for days that he planned to increase his Twitter stake by making a tender offer. In recent days he tweeted mentions of the Elvis Presley ballad ""Love Me Tender"" and the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel ""Tender Is the Night.""Mr. Musk's habit of tweeting obscure but market-moving information has kept Twitter's advisers on their toes. They have watched his Twitter account closely as they prepared for the possibility of a hostile bid, two people familiar with the matter said.The new filing seemingly offered its own Easter eggs of sorts. The documents included the names of the shell companies that would be involved in the transaction: X Holdings I, X Holdings II and X Holdings III. While shell companies are a staple of takeover offers, these entities share a name with X.com, an online banking start-up that Mr. Musk founded in 1999 and that later became part of PayPal. It is also the nickname of one of his children.In December, Mr. Musk replied with a thinking-face emoji to a popular Twitter thread suggesting that he create ""a holding company called X"" to become the parent company of Tesla, SpaceX and his other ventures.For Mr. Musk, even offering up details about takeover financing is a change. In 2018, he tried to take Tesla private and tweeted that he had ""funding secured,"" propelling Tesla shares higher. He did not have financing prepared for such a deal.The S.E.C. later filed a securities fraud lawsuit against him, accusing him of misleading investors. Mr. Musk paid a $20 million fine and agreed to step aside as Tesla's chairman for three years.Drew Pascarella, a senior lecturer of finance at Cornell University, said Morgan Stanley's involvement in the financing made this situation different. Other banks offering to lend to Mr. Musk include Bank of America, BofA Securities, Barclays, MUFG, BNPP and Mizuho.""There are lots of very senior people at Morgan Stanley that are responsible for that brand, that, in my view, would not allow this to happen unless there was some level of seriousness behind it,"" Mr. Pascarella said.Morgan Stanley declined to comment.Kate Conger and Ryan Mac contributed reporting.Kate Conger and Ryan Mac contributed reporting.PhotographElon Musk said in a new S.E.C. filing that he had banks' commitments to help finance his takeover bid, in part with loans against his Tesla shares.

124,22-Apr-22,Telegraph - Herald,Musk says he has financing to buy Twitter,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2653402514/BFD812D457A14912PQ/361?accountid=13946,"The Associated Press
Elon Musk says that he has lined up $46.5 billion in financing to buy Twitter, putting pressure on the company's board to negotiate a deal.
Last week, Musk announced an offer to buy the social media platform for $54.20 per share, or about $43 billion. At the time, he did not say how he would finance the acquisition.
The Tesla CEO said Thursday in documents filed with U.S. securities regulators that the money would come from Morgan Stanley and other banks, some of it secured by his huge stake in the electric car maker.
Twitter has yet to formally respond to Musk's offer, but the company has enacted an anti-takeover measure known as a poison pill that could make a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive.
The company said in a statement Thursday that it received Musk's updated proposal and ""new information on potential financing"" and said its board is ""committed to conducting a careful, comprehensive and deliberate review.""
Musk, who owns about 9% of Twitter shares, indicated that he's exploring what's known as a tender offer in which Musk would try to get other shareholders to pledge their stock to him at a certain price on a certain date, bypassing the board. If enough shareholders agree, Musk could use that as leverage to get the board to drop its ""poison pill"" defense against his offer of $54.20 per share.
But Musk hasn't decided yet whether to do that.
The poison pill could significantly raise the costs of a takeover. If someone acquires a 15% stake in the company, it would trigger a huge payout to shareholders that could bankrupt Twitter.
Other banks involved in Musk's financing include Barclays, Bank of America, Societe Generale, Mizuho Bank, BNP Paribas and MUFG. Morgan Stanley is one of Twitter's biggest shareholders, behind Vanguard Group and Musk.
Musk's documents say that $13 billion in financing came from Morgan Stanley and the other banks. As much as $12.5 billion would be loans secured by Musk's Tesla stock, and he also committed $21 billion in direct or indirect equity, although he didn't disclose the source of those funds. The filing says that the equity commitment could be reduced by contributions from others or additional debt taken on.
Musk is the world's wealthiest person, according to Forbes, with a nearly $279 billion fortune. But much of his money is tied up in Tesla stock - he owns about 17% of the company, according to FactSet, which is valued at more than $1 trillion - and SpaceX, his privately held space company. It's unclear how much cash Musk has.
Tesla allows executive officers to use shares as collateral for loans, but limits the borrowing to 25% of the value of the pledged shares. Musk owns 172.6 million shares worth $176.47 billion. Just over 51% of his stake already is pledged as collateral, according to a Tesla proxy statement. That means Musk could use the remaining stake to borrow about $21.5 billion.
Musk's latest move shows him ""ratcheting up the seriousness of purpose"" by lining up prominent banks that could finance his bid, said Donna Hitscherich, a finance professor at Columbia University.
""These are the usual suspects if you'd get financing,"" she said. ""But certainly it's pointing to the direction that he could make good on his thoughts were he to proceed in launching the tender offer.""
Shares of Twitter rose slightly to $47.04 in Thursday trading after the financing became public. The shares are trading $7.16 below Musk's offer.
""The market is waiting for this to come to a head"" and for competing bidders to come forward, said Olaf Groth, a business professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
The revelation of Musk's prominent financial backers was ""mildly surprising"" to Groth because ""a lot of his wealth is tied to Tesla performance and Tesla has been on the volatile side of stock performance."" On the other hand, Tesla reported strong quarterly results this week and Musk is ""viewed as coming through on things. That may be part of it,"" Groth said.
Musk ""is seeking to negotiate a definitive agreement for the acquisition of Twitter ... and is prepared to begin such negotiations immediately,"" the documents say.
Musk in recent weeks has voiced a number of proposed policy changes at Twitter, from relaxing its content restrictions - such as the rules that suspended former President Donald Trump's account - to ridding the platform of its problems with fake and automated accounts.
""If our twitter bid succeeds, we will defeat the spam bots or die trying!"" he tweeted Thursday.
Once competing bids surface, Twitter's board can look not just at the financial terms but what specific plans Musk or his competitors have for reshaping the social media business. That's when Musk's ideas – many of which he's tied to free speech principles – could come into play.
""That could be ground for rejecting the offer,"" Groth said of the business plans. ""Some of that will be (about) money and some of that will be a beauty contest. Some of the board members will also talk about what's in the public interest."""

UPS, not FedEx
To the Editor:
I have ""laid down"" with this dog many times over the years and each time have arisen with fleas, as the saying goes ("" Buy FedEx Stock. The Laggard Can Catch Up ,"" April 18). Credit to FedEx founder Fred Smith for a great idea, but no credit for changing with the times and innovating to stay ahead of the curve. FedEx's European business continues to be a low-margin drag with no relief in sight. Replacing Smith with his right-hand man of the past 20 years only perpetuates the status quo, as Smith continues to influence the decision making and company direction. As always, it's all about the jockey, not the horse. The lesson here: Go with a proven performer in this space—average into United Parcel Service in the months ahead.

The Case for Costco
To the Editor:
Andrew Bary's succinct article ("" Costco Thrives by Mastering Traditional Retailing. Now It's Challenging Amazon ,"" Preview, April 15) highlights the simplistic genius of the ""no jerk"" corporate culture of an ethical company that respects its members, shareholders, suppliers, and employees. Other retailers carry 100,000 items, but Costco warehouses stock only 4,000, which generated $192 billion in annual sales in 2021 (averaging $526 million in sales every day of that year). The narrow item concentration motivates suppliers to offer pricing advantages that are passed on to Costco members. I keep my Amazon.com account for the few items that Costco doesn't sell, but no retailer wows me like Costco.

Elon Musk's Ambition
To the Editor:
The petulant reaction of the folks trying to stop Elon Musk is most telling ("" Let Elon Musk Buy Twitter ,"" April 15). I would trust the genius who created the world's largest electric-vehicle company—and who can land a rocket on a barge in the ocean—over simple media elites.
Dan Mehalek, on Barrons.com
To the Editor:
The solution is rather simple. Instead of a company being allowed to censor or suppress content, it should instead create a series of filters that are user selected that will suppress the types of content a user doesn't want to view. Twitter can easily be made profitable through using it as a portal for more lengthy news stories—effectively charging people for using links to short news abstracts that then lead them to the full article. This would be a good source of revenue for Twitter as well as the authors. I could see a 30% cut for Twitter and 70% for the authoring vehicle as fair, similar to the Apple App Store. Also, it would be good for content providers to be allowed to moderate the responses to their content, though with the ability of people to view a comment they may have suppressed.

To the Editor:
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has long-term plans for Twitter, and his interest may spur others to throw in a bid or go in with him ("" The Numbers Behind Elon Musk's Bid to Acquire Twitter ,"" April 15). ThomaBravo wants to take Twitter private, but would have to make a better offer than Musk's. This is going to be exciting.

Wage-Price Spiral
To the Editor:
The wage-price spiral has only now begun to kick in ("" Inflation Isn't Close to Peaking. Why Prices Will Keep Rising ,"" April 15). There's too much focus on commodities and goods, where peak inflation may eventually bring demand destruction. But ours is a services economy, and higher consumer-price-indexed salary and wage hikes will flow through to higher prices across the board. Interest rates have to go higher, with the federal-funds rate over 4% along with bonds, as the Federal Reserve runs off its bloated balance sheet from the 2020 quantitative easing.
At the pace the Fed is going, that will take at least two years before inflation can normalize, unless rapid fed-funds rate hikes and demand destruction throw us prematurely into recession.
It's hard to see that happening in an election year, so I'll take the over—not the under—on inflation in 2023.

126,23-Apr-22,The Washington Post,"Musk is worth billions, but he'd buy Twitter with an IOU",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2653421166/BFD812D457A14912PQ/319?accountid=13946,"
SAN FRANCISCO - Elon Musk is the world's richest person, estimated by Forbes to be worth $270 billion.
That's about the size of Finland's economy. It's also more than a quarter of the about $1 trillion valuation of Tesla, the electric car company where he's CEO. And those are staggering amounts of money by any measure.
Musk owns a more than 20 percent stake in Tesla, according to analysts, which is where most of that wealth is tied up. He can't turn it into cash easily, although he did sell a significant chunk of his Tesla stock last year, including $5 billion over several days.
All of that means instead of spending his vast wealth, he treats his shares in his companies as collateral. Like using property to back a loan, Musk at times last year had put more than half of his Tesla shares down as collateral, according to financial filings, worth tens of billions of dollars.
""If Elon Musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan obligations, such sales could cause our stock price to decline,"" Tesla warned in its annual filing.
""We are not a party to these loans,"" Tesla wrote, adding that if its stock price declines, banks could force Musk to sell off shares to meet his loan obligations. That could send overall stock prices cratering.
But Musk plans to leverage himself further to buy Twitter, according to analysts and public filings.
Musk made public this week his financing plan to acquire the social media platform he says he wants to help serve as the public town square, where he communicates daily with his more than 80 million followers.
He outlined $46.5 billion he secured in funding to buy the social media company. More than half stems from loans from Morgan Stanley and other banks. But $21 billion will stem from his personal wealth.
That has Tesla investors concerned about the implications of his proposal to put Tesla shares on the line to buy Twitter.
And the massive amount of risk - especially after Tesla has shattered market expectations - left some financial analysts puzzled.
""You're giving away caviar to buy a hot dog on the street in New York City,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Thursday.
Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
Last year, a financial filing detailed that of his more than 170 million shares in Tesla - which would be valued at more than $170 billion today - more than half were put down as collateral to secure loans.
Musk's financial maneuvering has at times surprised investors and drawn the ire of regulators. The Tesla CEO famously declared in 2018 he had ""funding secured"" at $420 a share to take Tesla private. He later paid a $20 million fine to the Securities and Exchange Commission for the tweet and had to give up his board chairmanship of Tesla.
In May 2020, Musk declared he was selling most of his property. Musk tweeted one minute later that Tesla's stock valuation was excessive, sending shares plummeting.
In November, he polled followers about whether to sell 10 percent of his stake in Tesla. The poll collected more than 3.5 million votes, and 58 percent supported a sale. Later, it became clear Musk had planned to sell at least some of the shares all along.
Analysts who spoke with The Washington Post said that the sheer volume of Musk's collateral was unusual, and they said much of it was probably tied up in Musk's other business ventures, like rocket company SpaceX.
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos (who owns The Post) has publicly said he sold $1 billion a year in company stock to fund his space company, Blue Origin.
Musk first revealed he had purchased a more than 9 percent stake in Twitter earlier this month. He flirted with the idea of a board seat before launching a hostile takeover bid a week ago.
""This is all so unorthodox,"" said Benjamin Black, the New York-based co-head of Internet research at Deutsche Bank. ""It fits the character - we just don't know what to make of it.""
""If there's one thing that Elon doesn't want to do it's sort of mess up investor confidence in Tesla, which is the crown jewel of all of his holdings,"" he added.

127,24-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Says Bill Gates Is Shorting Tesla Stock—and He's Not Happy,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2653876098/BFD812D457A14912PQ/120?accountid=13946,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk is irked at Bill Gates. He doesn't see how Gates, a leading proponent of sustainable energy, could possibly sell Tesla's stock short. And Musk says Gates is doing just that.
In a tweet on Friday night. Musk said he believes Gates has sold short $500 million of Tesla shares (ticker: TSLA), betting the stock will fall. He went on to ridicule Gates' bodily girth–with a photo, an emoji, and a crude comment . He lost interest by Sunday, saying, he was ""Moving on"" from ""making fun of Gates for shorting Tesla while claiming to support climate change.""
It was a jarring performance by an executive whom Gates had publicly praised. In an interview last year on Sway, a New York Times podcast, Gates said: ""Well, it's important to say that what Elon did with Tesla is one of the greatest contributions to climate change anyone's ever made. And you know, underestimating Elon is not a good idea.""
Musk, evidently, felt underestimated. If Gates really believes in a greener future, he seemed to say, Gates has to believe in the electric-vehicle maker's stock. In the Friday night tweet, which came in response to a follower's query about a supposed text exchange between the two titans, Musk said he had confronted Gates about shorting Telsa. Tesla and the Gates Foundation didn't respond to requests for comment.
Shorting a stock means an investor borrows and sells shares they don't own, betting that the price will decline. Tesla, is no stranger to short selling; the company's stock was a very popular short in recent years. Bears didn't believe Tesla could popularize electric vehicles and fund its operations from internally generated cash flow.
Tesla did both. And most of the bears have gone away . Today, Tesla's short interest ratio–the amount of stock sold short compared with the total available for trading–looks downright average. About 3% of the stock available for trading has been sold short. The average for the S&P 500 is roughly 2%.
Tesla, however, is the most heavily shorted of companies with market capitalizations north of $1 trillion. Microsoft (MSFT), another trillion-plus company, and the others of similar size have an average short interest ratio below 1%.
Aside from concerns about a business's health, investors will also short a stock because of valuation. Tesla stock, a first glance, looks expensive. Shares trade for roughly 85 times estimated 2022 earnings. The Nasdaq Composite trades for about 26 times. But Tesla earnings are growing rapidly, expected to rise at a 50% average annual rate between 2021 and 2023.
Investors will also short stock as a hedge against rising interest rates or a recession. Higher growth stocks tend to get hit harder when rates rise and rates are rising now.
But if Gates is shorting Tesla, his reasons remain a mystery–hedging, valuation, or something else. Gates doesn't seem to have a problem with the mission of Tesla,, which is, as Musk puts it, to put the world on a path to a sustainable-energy future. Gates is vocal proponent of just such a future. Gates may still be a fan of Tesla's contribution to the environment but, for whatever reason, is skeptical of the stock price. That is possible, even if Musk doesn't think so.
None of this is likely to mean much for Tesla investors. They can handle news of one potential short seller, or Twitter sniping between two of the world's richest people. Tesla investors are inured to both drama and stock volatility.
Tesla stock, for instance, has ranged from $1,243 a share to $547 a share over the past year. The almost $700 spread is 56% of the stock's 52-week high. Microsoft, on the other hand, has ranged from about $350 to $238 a share. The $112 spread is only 32% of its 52-week high.

Twitter Inc. is in discussions to sell itself to Elon Musk and could finalize a deal as soon as this week, people familiar with the matter said, a dramatic turn of events just 10 days after the billionaire unveiled his $43 billion bid for the social-media company.
The two sides met Sunday to discuss Mr. Musk's proposal and were making progress, though still had issues to hash out, the people said. There is no guarantee they will reach a deal.
 PHOTOS: How Elon Musk Made the Fortune He'll Need to Buy Twitter 
Twitter had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made April 14 without saying how he would pay for it , and put in place a so-called poison pill to block him from increasing his stake. But after the Tesla Inc. chief disclosed that he has $46.5 billion in financing and the stock market swooned, Twitter changed its posture and opened the door to negotiations, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier Sunday.
Mr. Musk has said from the beginning that his $54.20-a-share offer is his ""best and final,"" and he reiterated to Twitter Chairman Bret Taylor again in recent days that he won't budge on price, some of the people said. The conversations between the two sides were expected to focus on issues including what Mr. Musk would pay should an agreed deal fall apart before being consummated.
Twitter is slated to report first-quarter earnings Thursday and had been expected to weigh in on the bid then, if not sooner.
The potential turnabout on Twitter's part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a ""yes-or-no"" decision to make, according to people familiar with the matter. He also pledged to solve the free-speech issues he sees as plaguing the platform and the country more broadly, whether his bid succeeds or not, they said.
Mr. Musk made his pitch to select shareholders in a series of video calls, with a focus on actively managed funds, the people said, in hopes that they could sway the company's decision.
Mr. Musk said he sees no way Twitter management can get the stock to his offer price on its own, given the issues in the business and a persistent inability to correct them. It couldn't be learned if he detailed specific steps he would take, though he has tweeted about wanting to reduce the platform's reliance on advertising , as well as to make simpler changes such as allowing longer tweets.
Some shareholders rallied behind him following the meetings. Lauri Brunner, who manages Thrivent Asset Management LLC's large-cap growth fund, sees Mr. Musk as a skilled operator. ""He has an established track record at Tesla,"" she said. ""He is the catalyst to deliver strong operating performance at Twitter."" Minneapolis-based Thrivent has a roughly 0.4% stake in Twitter worth $160 million and is also a Tesla shareholder.
Mr. Musk already has said he is considering taking his bid directly to shareholders by launching a tender offer . Even if he was to get significant shareholder support in a tender offer—which is far from guaranteed—he would still need a way around the company's poison pill, a legal maneuver it employed that effectively blocks him from building his stake to 15% or more.
One oft-employed tactic to push a bid, seeking to gain control of the target's board, is out of reach for now. Twitter's directors have staggered terms, meaning a dissident shareholder would need multiple years to gain control rather than a single shareholder vote. Twitter tried last year to phase out the staggered board terms given that they are frowned upon by the corporate-governance community, but not enough shareholders voted on the measure. The company is attempting to do so again at this year's annual meeting set for May 25. Only two directors are up for re-election, and it is too late for Mr. Musk to nominate his own.
Twitter's shares have been trading below his offer price since he made the bid April 14, typically a sign that shareholders are skeptical a deal will happen, though they did close up roughly 4% Friday at $48.93, the day after he unveiled financing for the deal. Mr. Musk has indicated that if the current bid fails, he could sell his stake, which totals more than 9%.
The financing included more than $25 billion in debt coming from nearly every global blue-chip investment bank aside from the two advising Twitter. The remainder was $21 billion in equity Mr. Musk would provide himself , likely by selling existing stakes in his other businesses such as Tesla. The speed at which the financing came together and the market selloff in recent days —which makes the all-cash offer look relatively more attractive—likely contributed to Twitter's greater willingness to entertain Mr. Musk's proposal.
Twitter's board should engage with Mr. Musk since its stock has ""gone nowhere"" since the company went public eight years ago, Jeff Gramm, a portfolio manager with Bandera Partners LLC, a New York hedge fund with about $385 million under management, said earlier. The firm last bought Twitter shares in February and owns about 950,000 overall, which accounts for about 11% of its portfolio.
Mr. Gramm said Twitter's board can't walk away from Mr. Musk's offer without providing an alternative that gives real value to shareholders. ""I'm not sure what that can be at this stage besides finding a higher bid,"" he said.

The takeover, if it goes through, would mark one of the biggest acquisitions in tech history and will likely have global repercussions for years to come related to how billions of people use social media.
What's the latest on Mr. Musk's offer to buy Twitter?
Mr. Musk has agreed to buy Twitter in a deal valued at about $44 billion, moving the world's richest man a step closer to taking control of the social-media platform.
Twitter shareholders will receive $54.20 per share in cash, a 38% premium to Twitter's closing stock price on April 1, the last trading day before Mr. Musk disclosed his approximately 9% stake in the company.
What was Mr. Musk's offer?
On April 14, he offered to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share , calling the $43 billion bid his ""best and final"" offer. Twitter had been expected to rebuff the bid, which Mr. Musk made without saying how he would pay for it. But after the Tesla Inc. chief executive disclosed that he had secured $46.5 billion in financing , Twitter changed its posture and opened the door to negotiations.
What does Mr. Musk want to do with Twitter?
Mr. Musk has said he aims to take Twitter private and transform the social-media company into one that relies less on advertising and that has less content moderation . He also wants to give Twitter users an edit function . He has also suggested making Twitter's algorithm open source, viewable by others that could recommend changes. A priority, he said, would be to try to stop spam and scam bots.
What has been the market and investor reaction to Mr. Musk's potential purchase?
Twitter shares were up about 6% midday Monday. The company's stock has swung this month as investors have followed the twists and turns of Mr. Musk's bid to buy the San Francisco-based company.
His bid for the platform has been popular among some individual investors, who have poured a net $747 million into the stock in April, according to Vanda Research data through Friday. That is nearly 10 times the average monthly purchase by the group in 2021. As CEO of Tesla, Mr. Musk has built a loyal following of individual investors.
What other companies is Elon Musk involved in?
In addition to serving as CEO of Tesla, Mr. Musk is the CEO of Space Exploration Technologies Corp., known as SpaceX. He also founded the tunnel-digging startup the Boring Co. and the brain-computer startup Neuralink.

 Twitter Accepts Elon Musk's Bid: What We Know So Far

130,25-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),Twitter's Capitulation to Musk Is Just Another Sign the Stock Market Is in Trouble,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2654439935/BFD812D457A14912PQ/249?accountid=13946,"Twitter is getting bought out by Elon Musk—and for a price that looks too low. It could be a sign that the problem is as much with the stock market as it is with Twitter itself.
Over the weekend, Twitter (ticker: TWTR) and the CEO of Tesla (TSLA) met to discuss Musk's recent offer to buy the company. Now the deal, which Twitter was expected to reject, is done . Twitter accepted a deal at $54.20 a share, or a roughly $44 billion valuation Monday afternoon.
 The deal itself is not exactly a vote of high confidence in Twitter. The price represents a 20% premium to the $45.08 a share the stock closed at before Musk made his offer. But it's also about 30% below the stock's all-time high of $77.06, hit in February 2021. When the chatter of a Musk takeover began, few thought the deal would go through. Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, recently told Barron's that Twitter's board would likely push for a better price , and he wasn't the only one. Still, the sides ultimately agreed on the original offer price.
Low confidence in Twitter might be deserved. The company reported a profit of $0.33 a share for the fourth quarter of 2021, missing expectations of $0.34, while the company posted a net loss in the third quarter rather than the $0.17 a share analysts had expected. Twitter will report first-quarter earnings Thursday and analysts are expecting adjusted earnings of 5 cents a share on sales of $1.226 billion, and few would be surprised if it missed.
But what looks like low confidence in Twitter might also reflect limited confidence in social media stocks—and even the stock market itself. Twitter stock is down 22% over the past 12 months, though that's helped by the 31% pop since just before Musk's stake was revealed, while the Global X Social Media ETF (SOCL) has dropped 47%. ""We view this as a turning point and likely came from the Board's realization that an alternative bid from a 'white knight' may be difficult to come by, especially following the decline in asset prices from social media companies in recent weeks/months,"" writes CFRA analyst Angelo Zino.
The stock market isn't doing so hot itself. The S&P 500 is already down about 12% for the year as the Federal Reserve begins tightening monetary policy to fight inflation. And there may be more downside to come. Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist, Mike Wilson, for one, wrote on Monday that the index could soon fall into bear-market territory, defined as a 20% drop.
Twitter's stock isn't immune to such a decline, which could be part of the reason Musk's offer is arguably low. For the year through April 1, just before Twitter stock popped as news broke that Musk owned 9% of the shares, the stock had fallen 9%. That was roughly double the S&P 500's drop for the year through April 1.
And if the recent market volatility is a sign of economic turbulence to come, Twitter's earnings and sales could take a hit as well. The company makes a big chunk of its money from advertising, and brands normally reduce their ad spending when their own sales expectations are lowered.
""If the advertising economy is slowing, then you would think Twitter is the least well-positioned social media company,"" said Rhys Williams, chief investment officer of Spouting Rock Asset Management, which does not own Twitter stock.
The point is that confidence in the stock market is so low that no one should be surprised to see an offer for Twitter look low as well.

131,25-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Twitter Advances After Accepting Elon Musk's Offer to Buy Company; Social-media company agreed to deal that values it at $54.20 a share,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2654036898/BFD812D457A14912PQ/348?accountid=13946,"Twitter Inc. shares climbed after the social-media company accepted Elon Musk's bid to take over the company.
Shares of the company rose 5.7% Monday to close at $51.70, their highest closing value in about five months. The stock rose above $52 at one point Monday before the deal was announced later in the trading day. Twitter's stock has swung wildly this month as investors followed the twists and turns of Mr. Musk's bid to buy the San Francisco-based company.
The $44 billion deal follows a dramatic courtship and marks a change of heart at Twitter, where many executives and board members initially opposed Mr. Musk's takeover approach. The Wall Street Journal had reported that the two sides met Sunday to discuss the proposal from Mr. Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc. and one of Twitter's most popular and vocal users. The parties worked through the night on a deal that values Twitter shares at $54.20 a share.
The talks progressed after Mr. Musk said he had lined up $46.5 billion to fund his bid for the company. Tesla shares declined 0.7% Monday to close at $998.02.
Mr. Musk had said from the start that his $54.20-a-share offer was his ""best and final."" The last time Twitter's shares traded above $54.20 was November 2021.
Since Mr. Musk disclosed a roughly 9% stake in the company in early April, Twitter shares have climbed 32%. That has pushed Twitter higher on a year-to-date basis, outpacing other technology companies and the broader market. The S&P 500 is down 9.9% for the year.
Twitter is expected to report first-quarter earnings Thursday. Analysts expect the company to post a boost in revenue, but a decline in net income compared with the year before, FactSet data show.
Mr. Musk has indicated that he wants to make substantial changes to Twitter , saying the company should shift toward a business model that relies more on subscriptions. He has also said Twitter should soften its stance on content moderation .
Mr. Musk's bid for the platform has been popular among individual investors, who poured a net $747 million into the stock in April, according to Vanda Research data through Friday. That is nearly 10 times the average monthly purchase by the group in 2021.

Twitter announced Monday afternoon that a deal has been reached , at the price of $54.20 per share in cash that was Mr. Musk's initial offer from April 14. Twitter's board was reportedly compelled to give the bid a fresh look after Mr. Musk filed papers late last week reporting $46.5 billion in financial backing for the bid.
Still unclear is what ultimately would become of Twitter under Mr. Musk's ownership. The accepted bid puts a $5 billion-a-year advertising business into the hands of someone who has publicly questioned Twitter's advertising business model and whose current company—Tesla—buys no advertising. The self-described ""free speech absolutist"" has also spoken out against Twitter's content-moderation practices, which are designed to keep toxic content off the social network and make it safer for advertisers. Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at ad-buying giant GroupM, says most advertisers who work with Twitter ""strongly prefer content standards"" on the service.

That may not matter a great deal to Mr. Musk, who said of his own Twitter campaign that it ""is not a way to make money"" in an onstage interview at the Ted conference, on the same day of the filing describing his financial support. But more than half of that backing comes in the form of debt, from Morgan Stanley and ""certain other financial institutions,"" according to the filing. That means Mr. Musk will need to preserve Twitter's cash flow—and ideally grow it—to service the debt. Some of that debt is in the form of margin loans backed by Mr. Musk's Tesla shares.
Doing that without advertising would be difficult. Ads account for nearly 90% of Twitter's revenue now, while data licensing provides most of the rest. The company launched Twitter Blue—its first consumer subscription offering—last year, rolling it out to the U.S. market in November. Chief Executive Parag Agrawal said on Twitter's last earnings call in February that the company has seen a ""strong response"" from ""our most heavy users"" for the service. But he added that Blue is ""not critical"" to reaching $7.5 billion of revenue in 2023, a target set at an analyst meeting in early 2021.
Mr. Musk will likely have his own goals in mind, and a privately held Twitter would be accountable only to him for reaching them. But since Mr. Musk has elected not to pay for Twitter entirely out of his own pocket, he'll have to be accountable to others as well.

 Elon Musk's Backing Means Twitter Needs Ads to Stay Aloft

133,25-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Twitter Accepts Elon Musk's Offer to Buy Company in $44 Billion Deal; Agreement to take social-media network private marks close of dramatic courtship,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2654439929/BFD812D457A14912PQ/437?accountid=13946,"Twitter Inc. accepted Elon Musk's bid to take over the company and go private , a deal that would give the world's richest person control over the social-media network where he is also among its most influential users.
The $44 billion deal marks the close of a dramatic courtship and a change of heart at Twitter, where many executives and board members initially opposed Mr. Musk's takeover approach. The deal has polarized Twitter employees , users and regulators over the power tech giants wield in determining the parameters of discourse on the internet and how those companies enforce their rules.
The two sides worked through the night to hash out a deal in which Mr. Musk plans to take Twitter private in a deal that values the company at $54.20 a share.
The takeover, if it goes through, would mark one of the biggest acquisitions of a tech company and will likely affect the direction of social media . Mr. Musk will bring a commitment to a more hands-off approach on speech moderation to a company that has struggled to reconcile freewheeling conversations with content that appeals to advertisers.
On Monday, a day after The Wall Street Journal first reported that a deal was close , Mr. Musk tweeted to indicate that he wants the platform to be a destination for wide-ranging discourse and disagreement.
""I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,"" he wrote .
Mr. Musk said after the deal was announced that he wants to make Twitter a better user experience, in part by adding new features and fighting spam. The billionaire, who is also chief executive of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., has a record of challenging conventions in disparate industries.
Twitter is facing significant business challenges and has already embarked on a turnaround plan after a fight with activist investor Elliott Management Corp. about two years ago. Twitter said a little over a year ago that it aimed to at least double its revenue to $7.5 billion by the end of 2023 and reach at least 315 million so-called monetizable daily active users at that time.
To reach that latter goal, the company would need to sharply increase its user growth, which has been in the single-digit percentage points for most of the past few years.
Among the other issues Mr. Musk will face is whether to allow Donald Trump back on Twitter, after the Republican former president's personal account was ""permanently suspended"" by the company last year in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of his supporters seeking to interfere with the certification of President Biden's 2020 election win.
Mr. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he had no plans to return to Twitter and would instead use his startup Truth Social as his preferred social-media network.
At an all-hands employee meeting on Monday afternoon, CEO Parag Agrawal said that there are no layoffs planned and that the company's priorities aren't changing before the deal closes, according to a person who heard the remarks. Mr. Agrawal said that once Mr. Musk takes over, ""we don't know what direction the company may go,"" the person said.
Mr. Agrawal said Mr. Musk agreed to convert employee stockholdings to cash once the deal closes and pay them out on the existing vesting schedule, the person said.
Bret Taylor, Twitter's independent board chairman, said the deal reflects the best outcome for shareholders.
The San Francisco-based social-media company had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made April 14 without saying how he would pay for it. A day after the unsolicited offer, Twitter adopted a so-called poison pill , designed to make it more difficult for Mr. Musk to reach more than a 15% stake in the company.
Twitter changed its posture after Mr. Musk detailed elements of his financing plan for the takeover. On April 21, he said he had $46.5 billion in funding lined up. Twitter shares rose sharply, and company executives opened the door to negotiations.
 Can Elon Musk Buy All of Twitter? How Tesla's CEO Made His Fortune 
Twitter shares rose 5.7% Monday to close at $51.70 each. The stock has been an anemic performer in an era of huge returns for technology companies. Its shares jumped on their first day of trading in 2013 to close at $44.90, within a dollar of where they were more than eight years later when Mr. Musk made his approach.
But since Mr. Musk disclosed a roughly 9% stake in the company in early April, Twitter shares have climbed 32%. That has pushed Twitter higher on a year-to-date basis, outpacing other technology companies and the broader market.
The turnabout on Twitter's part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders of the company to extol the virtues of his proposal while repeating that the board has a ""yes-or-no"" decision to make, people familiar with the discussions said.
Mr. Musk, with over 82 million Twitter followers, has long used the platform to pronounce his views on everything from space travel to cryptocurrencies. In January, he began buying Twitter stock, becoming the single-largest individual investor with a more than 9% stake by April.
He has previously used Twitter to escalate a conflict with the Securities and Exchange Commission after the agency opened a probe into some of his recent stock sales, and he often blasts his critics on the social network.
Taking Twitter private would allow Mr. Musk to make changes without the scrutiny public companies typically are under from their shareholders. He also has said he wants to retain as many shareholders as possible.
Twitter, at the beginning of April, invited Mr. Musk to join its board—which would have prevented him from owning more than 14.9% of the company's stock. Mr. Musk initially agreed and then rejected the offer .
Mr. Musk's proposed changes for the platform include softening its stance on content moderation, creating an edit feature for tweets, making Twitter's algorithm open source—which would allow people outside the company to view it and suggest changes—and relying less on advertising , among other ideas.
Mr. Musk, a self-described ""free speech absolutist,"" said in a recent interview at a TED conference that he sees Twitter as the ""de facto town square.""
Twitter should be more cautious when deciding to take down tweets or permanently ban users' accounts, Mr. Musk said, pointing to temporary suspensions as a better solution.
Mr. Musk said he also wants the platform to be more transparent when it takes action that amplifies or reduces a tweet's reach. He said he wasn't certain how some of those ideas would be implemented.
Twitter has spent years advocating for what it calls healthier discourse on its platform and adding content moderation, arguing at least in part that it is good for business.
The company also introduced new features that have been gaining some traction with users, including Twitter Spaces, which allows people to host live audio conversations with one another within the platform.
Mr. Musk has said he wants Twitter to rely less on advertising—which provided about 90% of its revenue in 2021—and shift its business model more toward subscriptions. The platform currently offers a subscription-based service called Twitter Blue, which gives customers premium features like ""undo tweet"" for $2.99 a month. He suggested removing all ads on Twitter as part of the subscription offerings.
Mr. Musk also floated the idea of cutting staff, shuttering the company's San Francisco headquarters building and not giving the board of directors a salary. The latter could save about $3 million a year alone, he said.
His other proposed changes for Twitter include trying to stop spam and scam bots and allowing for longer tweets. The current limit is 280 characters.
On Thursday, Twitter is scheduled to announce its first-quarter earnings. The company said Monday it no longer planned to hold a call with analysts that day.

134,25-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),Dogecoin Is Beating Bitcoin as Elon Musk's Plan to Buy Twitter Takes Shape,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2654309875/BFD812D457A14912PQ/489?accountid=13946,"Dogecoin is riding Muskmania.
The cryptocurrency most associated with Tesla (ticker: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk was flying on Monday, with dogecoin rising 6% as bitcoin, ether, and the rest of the digital asset space notched losses .
Holders of the coin may want to thank Musk's ambitions to buy Twitter (TWTR).
Musk met with Twitter leadership over the weekend to discuss his proposal to buy the company for $54.20 per share, and progress has been made to the point where a deal could be completed Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Barron's was told by a person familiar with the matter that a deal could be announced Monday.
Dogecoin has long been a favorite token of Musk, who has been an outspoken proponent of digital assets; he said last month that he wouldn't sell his dogecoin, and would also continue to hold bitcoin and ether.
The rise of dogecoin, which is a so-called memecoin — called that because it is mostly based on an internet joke rather than a significant blockchain project — has risen to be the 10th-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization fueled by Musk.
Earlier this year, Tesla began accepting dogecoin for merchandise purchases on its website. Dogecoin holders could be hoping that a Twitter under Musk's leadership could see more of the same — a use case for the token. Late last year Twitter unveiled a tipping function , allowing users to send creators Bitcoin.
Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at digital asset broker GlobalBlock, said that the Twitter deal news ""has led to speculators buying dogecoin due to Elon's obsession with the cryptocurrency, and hence the potential for dogecoin to be given more utility on one of the biggest social media networks if Elon is successful.""

135,26-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Tesla Stock Sinks After Twitter Deal; Vehicle maker's stock suffers worst day in more than a year after Elon Musk's announced purchase,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2655157475/BFD812D457A14912PQ/101?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc. shares logged their biggest one-day drop in more than a year after Elon Musk said he would buy Twitter Inc. in a $44 billion deal .
The shares slid 12% to $876.42 and were the worst performers in the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index Tuesday. The stock had its worst day since September 2020, when it fell 21% after it was passed over for inclusion in the S&P 500 index.
The stock is now down around 23% since April 4, when Mr. Musk first disclosed a position in the social-media company. Mr. Musk's takeover deal came together quickly and surprised shareholders and market watchers. It also spurred volatility in shares of both Twitter and Tesla.
The takeover adds to a list of high-profile ventures that Mr. Musk has juggled over the past decade. For more than a dozen years, he has led Tesla and rocket-and-satellite company SpaceX in addition to launching startups on the side.
Twitter will now account for around a sixth of his net worth, which is intertwined with his Tesla shares. Roughly $60 billion of his Tesla stock—about a third of his holdings—are collateral for bank loans. Mr. Musk also needs $21 billion in cash, which could mean selling some of his Tesla stockholdings, to close the deal.
Mr. Musk appears to have a sizable cushion before he would have to post more collateral for the $12.5 billion in bank loans used to purchase Twitter. His agreement with lenders indicates that he must post $100 in Tesla shares as collateral for every $20 in borrowings, leading to a so-called loan-to-value ratio of 20%. That amounts to around $62 billion worth of Tesla shares to back the loans.
Mr. Musk's agreement with lenders states that if on any day the value of his loan makes up more than 35% of the collateral he's posted on the borrowings, he would face a margin call. He would have to sell some of his shares, prepay the loans or post additional collateral. He would hit that threshold if the value of the posted shares tumbled to roughly $36 billion, akin to around a 43% drop.
That means if the value of those Tesla shares fell by roughly 43%, he would face a margin call.
Tesla stock is notoriously volatile and is known for its giant one-day moves, swings that have made the company a favorite bet for options traders looking to profit from the turbulence. Options on Tesla shares were widely traded Tuesday: Traders had spent more money on bearish options that would typically pay out if the shares fell further than calls tied to a jump, according to Shift Search by Vesica Technologies.
Tesla's shares had been outperforming the broader market before Mr. Musk disclosed his stake in Twitter. The shares had risen about 2% year-to date through the end of March, while the S&P 500 had fallen around 5% and other hot technology stocks had tumbled even more. The shares also got a boost last week when Tesla reported record quarterly profits , managing to wow investors despite supply chain bottlenecks and disruptions in China.
Recently, things have turned. Tuesday's losses have dragged the stock down around 17% for the year, compared with the broader market's roughly 12% decline.
Tesla has also faced growing competition. Ford Motor Co.'s first all-electric F-150 pickup truck is rolling off the assembly line Tuesday , pushing the company's move toward electrification. Shares of other electric-vehicle makers slid as well. Rivian Automotive Inc.'s shares lost almost 10%, while Lucid Group tumbled 8.7%.

 Tesla Stock Sinks After Twitter Deal

136,26-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"How Elon Musk Won Twitter; The social-media network was expected to reject the Tesla CEO's offer, but its bankers called the bid fair and said the company could struggle to get there on its own",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2654860323/BFD812D457A14912PQ/207?accountid=13946,"The future of Twitter Inc. changed on Thursday.
Elon Musk surprised the social-media company's board that morning by unveiling $46.5 billion in financing he had cobbled together in short order, adding credibility to the bare-bones takeover bid he had made just a week earlier.
Behind the scenes, Twitter's bankers delivered a report to its directors saying that not only was Mr. Musk's $54.20-a-share bid fair, but that the company also could struggle to get there on its own, people familiar with the matter said. Meanwhile, technology stocks—even of money machines like Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc.—were tanking, making Mr. Musk's all-cash offer seem more attractive.
What looked like a strong hand for Twitter's board just a few days earlier—when Mr. Musk didn't have the financing and had seemingly little shareholder support—was weakening by the hour.
Twitter representatives started asking Mr. Musk's camp questions about the financing, said people familiar with the matter. Then on Saturday, Bret Taylor, the Salesforce Inc. co-chief who leads Twitter's board, spoke to Mr. Musk, the people said. The full board was going to meet the following morning, he told the billionaire, to discuss taking the deal. He suggested they talk again afterward.
Twitter had been expected to reject Mr. Musk's offer , which was well below the high of nearly $80 that Twitter stock had traded at last year. But by the time the two men reconnected Sunday afternoon, Twitter's board had voted in favor of negotiating with Mr. Musk and advisers were hashing out a $44 billion deal. It was announced Monday afternoon. 
This account is based on conversations with people familiar with how the blockbuster deal came together.
Mr. Musk carried out his pursuit with his signature mix of mayhem and winking jabs. When he unveiled his bid, it sparked the same question that has surrounded his other business ventures , from mass-producing electric cars to putting humans on Mars to drilling giant tunnels for superfast travel: Could he pull it off?
Now he faces fresh challenges. Mr. Musk has hocked roughly $60 billion of his Tesla Inc. stock—about one third of his stake—as collateral for bank loans, tying his personal fortune to Twitter's. He must come up with $21 billion more in cash, which could mean selling additional shares in Tesla, just as the company is hitting its stride.
Tesla shares have lost about 8% since Mr. Musk first disclosed a Twitter stake, suggesting investors are worried he will be distracted or financially stretched.
Twitter will be saddled with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual interest payments, a risk for any company but especially in this case, as Mr. Musk has said he doesn't care whether it makes money—it has had trouble doing so over the years. And by pushing the company away from content moderation, which Mr. Musk has called censorship, he is likely to embroil it in debates about free speech and online safety.
Mr. Musk will face whether to allow former President Donald Trump back on Twitter. After the Jan. 6 riot last year, the company said it permanently suspended Mr. Trump's personal account . The former president told Fox News on Monday that he had no plans to return to Twitter and would instead use his Truth Social social-media network to reach followers.
The saga began on April 4, when Mr. Musk disclosed a more than 9% stake in Twitter, making him its largest shareholder. His regulatory filing was late, miscounted the number of shares he owned and indicated he would be a passive investor. His lawyers soon amended it to clarify that he could take an active role.
Twitter the next day announced that Mr. Musk would join its board. The two sides had already been discussing the possibility, and Twitter hoped doing so might muzzle him, as he had continued his public criticisms of the company.
Mr. Musk was already balking at how constrained he would be if he joined the board. Still, the two sides charged forward. Twitter completed a background check of Mr. Musk and aimed to make it official by the end of the weekend. But that Saturday, April 9, he told the company he had changed his mind.
Privately, he began plotting his next move: a full-fledged takeover bid. He went public on April 14 with his bid. ""I made an offer,"" he tweeted, along with a link to a regulatory filing. Once his advisers determined the offer should include a roughly 40% premium to Twitter's stock price, he decided to go with $54.20, which incorporated a running gag of his—a reference to April 20, an annual cannabis-celebration day.
The offer said nothing on how he planned to pay for it—no small feat, even for Mr. Musk, given that the bulk of his billions are tied up in Tesla shares and stakes in his other companies. It was part of an unorthodox plan devised by his team to get Twitter and the market to discount his offer at first, which could provide an edge in negotiations down the line.
Twitter's stock closed down that day, a sign shareholders weren't sure a deal would happen. For Wall Street, the bid brought back flashbacks of when he famously tweeted in 2018 that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 a share—yet another marijuana joke. The deal never happened, and he later paid regulators a $20 million fine in connection with the incident.
At first glance, the $54.20 offer appeared underwhelming to Twitter's advisers. The shares were down significantly and the company had been seen as a prize for potential suitors over the years, including deep-pocketed technology companies such as Salesforce.
 Twitter quickly installed a ""poison pill,"" a legal maneuver that would make it difficult for Mr. Musk to expand his stake beyond 15%. It was finalized on a quiet Good Friday, with stock markets closed for the holiday.
The turning point came Thursday, April 21, when Mr. Musk said he had lined up financing for his bid from blue-chip banks including Morgan Stanley, Barclays PLC and Bank of America Corp. The package—three-quarters of it drawn from Mr. Musk's personal fortune—lent credibility to the bid and neutralized potential criticism by Twitter. He also noted that his proposal was no longer subject to his team's completing due diligence, clearing a path for a deal to be reached at rapid speed.
Twitter had already been hearing from shareholders concerned that Mr. Musk's offer might be the best it could do, and the existence of financing ramped up pressure on directors to take it seriously.
In a series of video calls on Friday, Mr. Musk continued making his case to top shareholders, only fleetingly aware at the time that Twitter's board committee tasked with reviewing his bid was beginning to have a change of heart. Twitter's bankers had delivered an opinion that the company's go-it-alone path, in the worst case, could be well below $54.20 a share.
No serious corporate suitors surfaced after Mr. Musk made his bid, perhaps wary of taking on the world's richest person and mindful of a chillier antitrust climate in Washington. A sale to a private-equity firm would be difficult to finance.
Mr. Musk sensed a shift when Mr. Taylor talked to him the following day and pressed him on whether he would sweeten the offer. Mr. Musk had previously said his offer was ""best and final"" and wouldn't budge now, telling Mr. Taylor that he had a reputation to protect. Mr. Musk was prepared to take the bid directly to shareholders if the board rejected it—something he had already suggested publicly via a series of cryptic tweets.
The pair agreed to reconvene the next day, after Twitter's board would officially vote on whether to open negotiations with Mr. Musk. On Sunday, Mr. Musk made clear to Twitter he was eager to complete a deal by Monday. Because the price was fixed, Twitter focused its negotiations on protections for shareholders in case the deal didn't go through, given Mr. Musk's fickle nature and his rocky relations with regulators.
Advisers on both sides were still putting the finishing touches on the deal Monday morning, and hopes for a premarket announcement faded. The news came instead in the middle of the trading day—an almost-unheard-of rollout for big corporate news.
It was a fitting coda to an unconventional deal. Mr. Musk trolled Twitter on its own platform through the two-week takeover battle, offering a glimpse of the Twitter he envisions and that he will now be able to pursue—unshackled by content guidelines or niceties. He took swipes at Twitter's bankers, U.S. securities regulators, fellow billionaire Bill Gates and Justin Bieber, whose infrequent tweeting he seemed to take as a symptom of the platform's flaws.
At an all-hands employee meeting Monday afternoon, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal said there were no layoffs planned and that the company's priorities weren't changing before the deal closed, said people who heard the remarks. Asked about the possibility that Mr. Trump would be allowed back on Twitter, Mr. Agrawal deflected, according to the people, saying that once Mr. Musk takes over, ""We don't know what direction the company may go.""

137,26-Apr-22,USA Today (Online),"Would Elon Musk move Twitter from California to Texas, like Tesla? Here's why he could.",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2655078056/BFD812D457A14912PQ/212?accountid=13946,"Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, the CEO of Austin, Texas-based automaker Tesla, has reached a deal to acquire social media platform Twitter. That raises an obvious question: Once the deal is completed, might Musk move Twitter's corporate headquarters to Austin, which has increasingly become a center of operations for him and his companies?  Musk's pursuit of Twitter has been ongoing for weeks, and on Monday, Twitter's board agreed to the sale, which is worth about $44 billion. With Twitter owned by Musk, industry analysts and Austin-area tech officials say it's not a stretch to think that he might move the company's headquarters from San Francisco to Austin, or at least create a much larger corporate presence for the company in central Texas, which has become a focal point for Musk's companies.  WILL MUSK LET TRUMP BACK ON TWITTER?: All signs point to yes TWITTER UNDER ELON MUSK: What Twitter would look like with the Tesla and SpaceX billionaire CEO running it Musk's presence in Texas Musk late last year announced that he was moving Tesla's corporate headquarters from California to Travis County, on the site of the automaker's $1.1 billion manufacturing plant, which recently began production. Musk also moved the headquarters of his tunneling and infrastructure company, The Boring Company, to Central Texas, either in Pfluergerville if you go by filings in California and Texas, or Bastrop if you go by the company's own job listings. Musk is also involved with a likely expansion of his aerospace company SpaceX in Austin, a potential Neuralink office in Austin, and the relocation of the headquarters of his private foundation to Austin.  On Monday, after news of the deal, broke, Gov. Greg Abbott encouraged the idea of the company moving to Texas.  ""@elonmusk. Bring Twitter to Texas to join Tesla, SpaceX & the Boring company,"" Abbott said in a tweet.  Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said that once Musk acquires Twitter, it's likely the deal will result in a significant Twitter presence in Austin. ""He's going to have more and more of his operations around Tesla, and I think down the road there'll be some portion of SpaceX operations, and then ultimately Twitter,"" Ives said. ""It's all part of the Musk structure."" Ives said the entrepreneurial environment in Austin is similar to the ""Musk DNA.""  ""I think he's more comfortable in Austin than in California,"" Ives said. Mark Arend, editor-in-chief of Site Selection Magazine, a national publication that tracks economic development trends around the county, said that while he has no way of knowing whether Musk would relocate Twitter to Austin, there could be benefits to the move.  “Austin, like other metros in Texas, has a big labor pool and plenty of room to build new facilities with access to key infrastructures like Interstates and an airport with more international destinations all the time,” Arend said. “The University of Texas in Austin would be a major source of skilled labor, as other universities and colleges in the area would be. Companies and employees relocating to Austin would likely enjoy a lower cost of housing, energy and living than many markets, including many in California.” Amber Gunst, CEO of the Austin Technology Council, agreed that if Musk's deal for Twitter is completed, she thinks it's likely Twitter would move its headquarters to Austin. But that might not result in a large influx of Twitter workers to central Texas, she said.  ""As the vast majority of their staff is working remote on a permanent basis, I don't see a significant increase in people moving to Austin specifically for a role within the company,"" she said. ""That could potentially change if new leadership decided they wanted employees back in the office. This could also have an impact on those employees who have relocated to other areas and whether they would be willing to continue with the company if that happens."" Some tech analysts not convinced But some technology industry analysts say they aren't convinced Musk would move Twitter's headquarters to Austin. Roger Kay, an analyst with Endpoint Technologies Associates, said there's no reason to move Twitter's corporate headquarters to a new location.  ""Other than the fact that Musk is moving everything he's got (to Austin), there's no obvious reason to take a company which is virtual, from the very beginning, born in the cloud, to create a physical location,"" Kay said. ""They can be anywhere, and the fact that they're in San Francisco is primarily because ... that's where they were, and that's where they got the employees.""  Kay said Musk could establish a small supervisory location for Twitter in Austin, but said he thinks the majority of the company's operations would likely remain in California. In California, the company currently has several thousand employees, but Twitter has also been among the companies most embracing remote work. Last year, CEO Parag Agrawal announced in a tweet that employees would have the option of working remotely ""forever.""  Kay said that for Twitter's current employees, there's little incentive to uproot from California.  MUSK'S TWITTER: Will free speech mean more hate speech on Twitter under Elon Musk? 'DID WE JUST LOSE?': Twitter users react to Elon Musk buying the social media platform ""You're not going to get the employees from San Francisco to go to Texas. It's a totally different crowd,"" Kay said. ""Managers like Musk and others move to Texas for their own libertarian reasons. They like Texas' lesser regulation and do-what-you-want culture."" If the Austin area did land Twitter's corporate headquarters, it would add to a recent flood of economic development wins for the region, which include the Tesla and Boring Co. relocations, and Oracle moving its corporate headquarters to Austin, along with expansions by Apple and Amazon. Twitter also wouldn't be the first social media giant with a major corporate presence in the Austin area, as Facebook and its parent company Meta have multiple Austin-area offices and more than 2,000 employees. Bryce Bencivengo, director of public relations and media for the Austin Chamber of Commerce, said the recent expansions and relocations show how attractive Austin is to many corporations. ""The secret sauce that Austin has, which I don't think is very secret, is talent,"" he said. ""The talent pipeline in central Texas is really, really strong. I think that's a big part of why we've seen companies relocate and feel comfortable expanding here.""  Gunst, of the Austin Technology Council, said the growth and success of the region's technology sector has also been key. ""Our tech community has greatly benefited from this success and not just from relocations of larger company headquarters or expansions, but by the entrepreneurship that has developed as a result,"" Gunst said.

On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down by over 230 points as investors continue the April sell-off. This comes as concerns about the global economic growth took center stage. With Covid resurging in China and strict lockdowns in major cities like Shanghai, investors are certainly feeling the jitters right now.

UPS Beats Estimates Across Top And Bottom Lines; Doubles Down Share Repurchases
United Parcel Services (NYSE: UPS) seems to be gaining attention in the stock market now. This follows the company’s latest earnings release from earlier today. In it, UPS is looking at earnings of $3.05 per share on revenue of $24.4 billion for the quarter. For reference, this handily tops Wall Street estimates of $2.88 and $23.78 billion respectively. By and large, UPS is likely seeing the results of its price raises amidst a strong e-commerce market. Additionally, the company has been and still is focusing on more profitable end markets as well. Among which are the health care and small-and-medium-sized businesses (SMBs) segments. As a result of all this, UPS stock could be worth watching in the stock market today.
Providing some additional commentary on UPS’s latest performance is CEO Carol Tome. She writes, “The agility of our network and the continued execution of our strategy delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, putting us on our way to achieving our 2022 consolidated financial targets.” This would be Tome referring to UPS’s reaffirmation of its $102 billion annual revenue forecast for the current fiscal year. As its quarterly revenue continues to soar towards greater heights, this is not all that surprising. Not to mention, UPS is also planning to double its stock buyback plan this year to $2 billion. Overall, it appears that UPS is going from strength to strength despite macroeconomic headwinds. Because of all this, UPS stock is now up by over 1.5% today.

Elon Musk To Buy Twitter For $44 Billion; The End Of The Saga?
In other news, the weeks-long epic between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) has come to an end for now. As of yesterday, Twitter is taking up Musk’s offer to buy out the company for a whopping $44 billion. Accordingly, this would see further attention come to TWTR stock now. Across the board, users and investors alike will likely be watching closely as to what happens with the firm next. In particular, the future direction of one of the most influential social media platforms to date.
For one thing, Musk has plenty to say about his latest purchase. The Tesla CEO states, “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated. I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spambots, and authenticating all humans.” He also adds that the company has “tremendous potential,” that he hopes to tap into.
At the same time, former CEO Jack Dorsey also hails the sale as a positive move by Twitter. He argues that Musk and current CEO Parag Agrawal are bringing Twitter “out of an impossible situation.” Time will tell if the duo can make the most of Twitter in its current state.

139,26-Apr-22,Washington Examiner,Why are so many liberals and Democrats afraid of an African immigrant owning Twitter?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2655387514/BFD812D457A14912PQ/291?accountid=13946,"Recently, equity, diversity, and inclusion have been the core tenets of left-wing political orthodoxy. So, with the news that Elon Musk would be leading a group of investors purchasing Twitter, one would think this would be celebrated by many on the Left. After all, an immigrant from Africa who received an Ivy League education and became a business owner and now leads one of the world's largest social media and tech companies should be the symbolic ""dream"" for Democrats and liberals. Yet, many have demonstrated a disturbing lack of enthusiasm.
Hardly anybody on the Left seems happy about the African immigrant's Twitter purchase. Furthermore, many have claimed they would be leaving the platform in protest because they object to Musk's promise of allowing free speech. It's odd behavior that should be exposed for its bigotry. After years of proclaiming to want to protect our democracy, many liberals and Democrats have protested protecting one of its hallmarks.
Consider the temper tantrum tweeted by former Vermont governor and Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean. In a recent tweet, Dean said, ""Hi Twitterverse. Many thanks for the knowledge and sharing over the past ten years or so. If Musk takes over Twitter I will be off within a few hours. Might be just as well for my well being but I've learned a lot of valuable stuff from many of you. Thank you all. Howard.""Dean deleted his Twitter account soon after the tweet.
Or consider the tweet of race provocateur Shaun King. King was so distraught at Musk owning Twitter that he blamed white power, writing, ""At its root, @ElonMusk wanting to purchase Twitter is not about left vs right. It's about white power. The man was raised in Apartheid by a white nationalist. He's upset that Twitter won't allow white nationalists to target/harass people. That's his definition of free speech.""King also deleted his Twitter account shortly after this tweet.
Of course, at the root of Dean's and King's objections is nothing more than bigotry and prejudice — ideological bigotry and prejudice. They, and all of the other liberals and Democrats who posted melodramatic freakouts on Twitter after news of Musk's purchase, want to do nothing but silence dissenting views and opinions.
These people feel morally superior to those they disagree with and feel such dissidents are not worthy enough to enjoy free speech. They don't care about racial equity or immigrants or any other causes they allegedly support. All they want to do is have people support, indoctrinate, and reinforce their political ideology. They want to tear down American democracy under the guise of protecting it. Democracy isn't their ultimate objective — totalitarian absolutism is.

140,26-Apr-22,The Washington Post,$44 billion puts Musk in control of Twitter,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2654864885/BFD812D457A14912PQ/342?accountid=13946,"Tesla CEO's views on speech and transparency
could signal site changes 

SAN FRANCISCO - Elon Musk acquired Twitter for $44 billion on Monday, the company announced, giving the world's richest person command of a highly influential social media site that serves as a platform for political leaders, a sounding board for experts across industries and an information hub for millions of everyday users.
The acquisition followed weeks of evangelizing on the necessity of ""free speech,"" as the Tesla CEO seized on Twitter's role as the ""de facto town square"" and took umbrage with content moderation efforts he views as an escalation toward censorship. He said he sees Twitter as essential to the functioning of democracy and said the economics are not a concern.
Ownership of Twitter gives Musk power over hugely consequential societal and political issues, perhaps most significantly the ban on former president Donald Trump that the site enacted in response to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.
Under the terms of the deal, Twitter will become a private company and shareholders will receive $54.20 per share, the company said in a news release. The deal is expected to close this year.
""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,"" Musk said in the release. ""I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.""
""Twitter has tremendous potential - I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it,"" he added.
Musk's Twitter deal further expands his portfolio beyond rocket company SpaceX, which has aspirations of landing on Mars, and carmaker Tesla, which pushed electric vehicles into the mainstream.
""He's more powerful than countries now,"" said Ross Gerber, a Tesla investor close to Musk who said he had bought Twitter shares last week in hopes the deal went through. ""He has the most important technology asset in America . . . probably one of the most strategic military assets in the world . . . and now he has one of the most important communications tools in the world.""
Musk's positions on free speech and how to police the site have put him relatively at odds with current Twitter leadership, raising questions about how he will seek to steer his changes through and whether they will affect Twitter's current executive makeup.
That was a major topic at a town hall held by Twitter leadership Monday, during which employees questioned what Musk's ownership might mean for the company, according to a record of the call obtained by The Washington Post. Employees expressed fears about everything from layoffs to the future of the business to whether Twitter will continue to make money from advertising.
Employees asked why CEO Parag Agrawal ""trusted"" Musk, and how Musk ""would be held accountable"" when, as a private company, Twitter would have no board of directors. Executives offered assurances but few direct answers, and said that business would continue as usual until the deal goes through within three to six months.
Musk has said he would open up Twitter's algorithm, putting content moderation decisions into clear view, although some researchers have said that would be difficult. He has also pushed for simple, broadly popular changes such as adding an edit button, as well as pledging to eliminate spam bots. And he has said he wants to open up Twitter's verification process to more users, so the authenticity of accounts can be determined more easily.
While it is unclear how Musk might address the Trump ban, he said at a TED conference this month he would want to be ""very cautious"" with permanent bans, preferring timeouts instead.
He and Trump have found areas of agreement in the past. Musk thanked Trump on Twitter for his support when Musk defiantly reopened Tesla's Fremont, Calif., manufacturing plant in May 2020, in violation of county-level coronavirus shelter-in-place orders.
Musk, an avid Twitter user with more than 83 million followers, earlier on Monday hinted that a deal was close, laying out his vision for the future of Twitter in a midday tweet. ""I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,"" he wrote.
The deal would rank among the largest activist takeovers of a publicly traded company, according to Dealogic, which tracks data on mergers.
Twitter board chair Bret Taylor said the decision came down to the economics of the deal. ""The proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium, and we believe it is the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders,"" he said in the release.
Twitter's board completed its review of Musk's offer last week, including coming up with possible valuations of the company, according to a person briefed on the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss them publicly.
Taylor spoke directly with Musk on Saturday to update him on the process, the person said. At the conclusion of Twitter's board meeting on Sunday, the company notified Musk it was ready to proceed with a deal around his proposed price, said that person and another person briefed on the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity for the same reasons.
The saga of Musk's Twitter ownership began April 4 when Musk surprised investors by disclosing that he had taken a more than 9 percent stake in Twitter.
Twitter responded by offering Musk a board seat, which it announced the next day. Musk turned the seat down a few days later. By April 13, according to financial filings, Musk expressed his intention to pursue a hostile takeover of the company.
Meanwhile, Twitter seemed poised to reject Musk's bid. The board adopted a ""poison pill"" plan the day after Musk's offer became public that would make it much more difficult for the billionaire to buy the company.
The strategy, known as a shareholder rights plan, would let investors buy Twitter stock at a discounted price unavailable to Musk. The flood of new shares would potentially make it prohibitively expensive for Musk to buy the company.
Musk then publicly outlined his financing, saying last week that he had secured $46.5 billion through loans by banks, including Morgan Stanley, and his own equity.
The company's board of directors met with Musk on Sunday, and negotiations went into the early hours of Monday, according one of the people familiar with the discussions. The two sides were focused on determining whether Musk had the financing to complete the acquisition, and they did not spend much time discussing Musk's strategy for the future of the social network, said the people familiar with the discussions.
It's unclear whether Musk will retain other shareholders in the private company. Musk said previously that he would want to let the maximum allowable number of shareholders stay on.
Musk taking control will probably reignite the debate over whether social media companies should do a better job of policing content such as hate speech and violence, or if they should take a hands-off approach - a difficult balance for all social media. Twitter started with a hands-off approach but has instated more content moderation and policing, including its banning of Trump.
NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement Monday that ""lives are at risk, and so is American democracy.""
""Mr. Musk: free speech is wonderful, hate speech is unacceptable. Disinformation, misinformation and hate speech have NO PLACE on Twitter. Do not allow 45 to return to the platform,"" he said, referring to Trump.
The Bloomberg Billionaire's Index puts Musk's worth at about $259 billion, but much of his wealth is tied up in stock.
Beyond the bank loans, it's unclear how Musk intends to pay for more than $21 billion of the deal which he described as ""equity financing"" from himself. He could borrow against or sell Tesla shares, though that path would raise risks for the share price of the carmaker.
""If Elon Musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan obligations, such sales could cause our stock price to decline,"" Tesla warned in its annual filing.
Some Tesla investors have bristled at Musk's bid because they say it distracts from his responsibilities as chief executive and could slow momentum at one of the world's most valuable automakers. And internally, Twitter employees have raised concerns about Musk's potential effect on the company's culture.
Musk is very active on the platform, having tweeted more than 17,300 times. He averages 125,180 likes per tweet, according to Socialtracker. Musk has earned praise for his wide-ranging approach to the site: He toggles freely between crude memes targeting his rivals, polls on the state of free speech and critical business decisions.
His tweets have gotten him into trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In 2018, he wrote that he had ""Funding secured"" to take Tesla private at $420 a share.
He said he chose $420 ""because he had recently learned about the number's significance in marijuana culture and thought his girlfriend would find it funny, which admittedly is not a great reason to pick a price,"" according to the federal complaint.
The deal could raise new regulatory issues for Musk, too.
Because of the deal's size, Musk will be required under federal law to report his purchase of Twitter to the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. Multiple legal experts said the deal does not present clear antitrust concerns because Twitter is not being purchased by a social media competitor. But given Democrats' focus on concentration of power, especially in the tech sector, it's possible that government regulators could open a review of the deal and slow it down.
""If you're sitting in the agencies, you're aware of that atmosphere,"" said William E. Kovacic, a former Republican chair of the FTC.
Regulators could raise objections to Musk potentially collateralizing the purchase with Tesla stock, according to former SEC lawyer Tyler Gellasch, who now runs Healthy Markets, a nonprofit organization advocating market reforms.

141,26-Apr-22,Los Angeles Times,BUSINESS; Twitter agrees to $44-billion buyout by Musk,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2654943147/BFD812D457A14912PQ/402?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk's bid to buy Twitter and take the company private succeeded Monday, 11 days after the world's wealthiest man first announced that he'd like to buy the social media company.
""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,"" Musk said in a statement announcing the board's approval of the $44-billion deal. ""I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.""
The company's leadership initially tried to fend off the bid, adopting a ""poison pill"" measure that would make a hostile takeover difficult.

But Musk announced that he had $46.5 billion in financing lined up in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, prompting Twitter's board to meet Sunday to discuss the bid. After that meeting, the board opened negotiations with Musk that stretched late into the night, according to reporting by the New York Times.
The deal values Twitter stock at about $54 a share, above the $39 that the stock was trading at before Musk's interest in the company became clear in early April, when he purchased a 9% stake in the company, but also well below the stock's 2021 high of $77 a share.
After the news of the deal went out, Twitter shares rose 5.7% to $51.70 by the end of Monday's trading.
In a virtual all-hands meeting Monday afternoon, Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal said that layoffs are not planned ""at this time.""
In response to an employee question about reinstating the Twitter account of former President Trump, Reuters reported that Agrawal said, ""Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go.""
Musk stated that his interest in Twitter is motivated not by the company's finances but by its role as a public forum and his belief that he could manage the platform better than its current leadership.
But Musk has indicated he will tilt Twitter's content moderation in a permissive direction, writing in his SEC filing, ""I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy.""
Since its launch in 2006, Twitter has become one of the core companies of the social media age -- but it has had a difficult time becoming a profitable business and has been a site of explosive disagreement over the moderation of online speech.
Founded by Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams, Noah Glass and Biz Stone as a site that allowed users to post 140-character messages using SMS texting, Twitter experienced its first surge of interest after a presentation at the 2007 SXSW festival in Texas.
The next few years brought explosive growth. In 2011, the company had 100 million monthly active users. By the time Twitter went public, in 2013, that number had doubled to more than 200 million people.
But Twitter could not sustain that rate of expansion. While Facebook, Instagram and upstart platform TikTok each rocketed past Twitter to more than 1 billion users in the last decade, Twitter hit a plateau. The company counted 300 million monthly users in 2019 before switching its reported metrics. Now it has 217 million monetizable daily active users, according to its latest corporate filings.
Under a series of chief executives, Twitter did figure out how to squeeze more money out of those users. Revenue grew from $1.4 billion in 2014 to more than $5 billion in 2021. But the company booked a profit only in 2018 and 2019 and returned to losing money the last two years.
Research firm MoffettNathanson wrote that Musk's offer was ""a steal of a deal for shareholders given the operating, monetization and valuation challenges at the company,"" but the authors cautioned that they ""expect advertisers will be less willing to spend on Twitter if Elon Musk removes content moderation in order to promote free speech.""
Even as its user growth stagnated, however, Twitter became the go-to platform for journalists and politicians, a volatile combination that has turned it into one of the key battlegrounds in the fight over online harassment, the limits of public speech and the power of tech companies.
Nowhere was the battle hotter than in the debate around banning Trump from the platform. Over the course of his presidency, Trump used Twitter daily to opine about current events, announce U.S. policy changes and interact with his 88 million followers.
Often, the president's tweets were untrue, and after the 2020 presidential election, he frequently tweeted the unfounded conspiracy theory that he was the rightful winner of that election, which he claimed was somehow manipulated to make him lose. After the Jan. 6 attempt to overthrow the U.S. government, Twitter shut down the sitting president's account and permanently suspended him from the service.
Musk's bid for the company and rhetoric around free speech have fueled speculation that he would reinstate Trump's account. Musk has not commented directly on the possibility. Trump said in an April interview that he ""probably wouldn't have any interest"" in returning to Twitter, which he said has ""become very boring.""
Musk, whose list of startups includes the company that eventually became PayPal as well as Tesla and SpaceX, has never been banned, but he has faced his own Twitter muzzle, one imposed by the SEC after he said in an August 2018 tweet that he had ""funding secured"" for a bid to take publicly traded Tesla private at $420 a share.
Musk had never secured any funding for the deal. The tweet led to fraud charges against him by the SEC. In a settlement, Musk agreed to a $20-million fine and removal as Tesla chairman for three years. The SEC also required him to designate a company officer to review his tweets for possible violations of securities law, a position that came to be known as Musk's ""Twitter sitter.""
Musk continued tweeting information about Tesla stock, future financial performance, upcoming products and other information that could be construed as the kind of ""material information"" the SEC had sought to put a brake on. The timing of his replies to followers suggested no review was being conducted.
After Joe Biden became president, the SEC began issuing subpoenas to Musk on the ""funding secured"" matter and hinted that it was investigating other matters related to Musk.
Recently, Musk has said that he was pressured into signing the SEC settlement and did so only because Tesla was on the verge of bankruptcy at the time and that fighting the government on fraud charges could have cut off access to financing and sunk the company.
With no overlap with his other businesses, Musk's acquisition of Twitter isn't expected to receive antitrust scrutiny, but some observers -- including Amazon Chairman Jeff Bezos, Musk's rival in the private space industry -- have raised the prospect that Musk's business interests in China, an important supplier and market for Tesla, could create a conflict with his ownership of a social media platform.
""Twitter currently is among platforms which provide some avenues for advocacy for Chinese dissidents, and so there would be a serious human rights cost if they lost it as a way of communicating with each other and the rest of the world,"" said David Greene, civil liberties director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
""Did the Chinese government just gain some leverage over the town square?"" Bezos tweeted.

142,26-Apr-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Twitter Must Have Ads to Stay Aloft --- Musk will want to preserve cash flow from the business to pay off the debt used to back a deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2654978911/BFD812D457A14912PQ/500?accountid=13946,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Wall Street has long known that it is better to play with other people's money. But in the case of Elon Musk, other people's money may limit just how much playing he can do with Twitter.
The campaign by the World's Richest Person on paper to take over the social network has proven to be a success. Twitter announced Monday afternoon that a deal has been reached, at the price of $54.20 per share in cash that was Mr. Musk's initial offer from April 14. Twitter's board was reportedly compelled to give the bid a fresh look after Mr. Musk filed papers late last week reporting $46.5 billion in financial backing for the bid.
Still unclear is what ultimately would become of Twitter under Mr. Musk's ownership. The accepted bid puts a $5 billion-a-year advertising business into the hands of someone who has publicly questioned Twitter's advertising business model and whose current company -- Tesla -- buys no advertising. The self-described ""free speech absolutist"" has also spoken out against Twitter's content-moderation practices, which are designed to keep toxic content off the social network and make it safer for advertisers. Brian Wieser, global president of business intelligence at ad-buying giant GroupM, says most advertisers who work with Twitter ""strongly prefer content standards"" on the service.
That may not matter a great deal to Mr. Musk, who said of his own Twitter campaign that it ""is not a way to make money"" in an onstage interview at the Ted conference, on the same day of the filing describing his financial support. But more than half of that backing comes in the form of debt, from Morgan Stanley and ""certain other financial institutions,"" according to the filing. That means Mr. Musk will need to preserve Twitter's cash flow -- and ideally expand it -- to service the debt. Some of that debt is in the form of margin loans backed by Mr. Musk's Tesla shares.
Doing that without advertising would be difficult. Ads account for nearly 90% of Twitter's revenue now, while data licensing provides most of the rest. The company launched Twitter Blue -- its first consumer subscription offering -- last year, rolling it out to the U.S. market in November. Chief Executive Parag Agrawal said on Twitter's last earnings call in February that the company has seen a ""strong response"" from ""our most heavy users"" for the service. But he added that Blue is ""not critical"" to reaching $7.5 billion of revenue in 2023, a target set at an analyst meeting in early 2021.
Mr. Musk will likely have his own goals in mind, and a privately held Twitter would be accountable only to him for reaching them. But since Mr. Musk has elected not to pay for Twitter entirely out of his own pocket, he'll have to be accountable to others as well.

143,26-Apr-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition","Musk Strikes Deal to Buy Twitter --- Social-media firm opts to sell for $44 billion, one of the biggest tech acquisitions in history",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2654978916/BFD812D457A14912PQ/624?accountid=13946,"Twitter Inc. accepted Elon Musk's bid to take over the company and go private, a deal that would give the world's richest person control over the social-media network where he is also among its most influential users.
The $44 billion deal marks the close of a dramatic courtship and a change of heart at Twitter, where many executives and board members initially opposed Mr. Musk's takeover approach. The deal has polarized Twitter employees, users and regulators over the power tech giants wield in determining the parameters of discourse on the internet and how those companies enforce their rules.
The two sides worked through the night to hash out a deal in which Mr. Musk plans to take Twitter private in a deal that values the company at $54.20 a share.
The takeover, if it goes through, would mark one of the biggest acquisitions of a tech company and will likely affect the direction of social media. Mr. Musk will bring a commitment to a more hands-off approach on speech moderation to a company that has struggled to reconcile freewheeling conversations with content that appeals to advertisers.
On Monday, a day after The Wall Street Journal first reported that a deal was close, Mr. Musk tweeted to indicate that he wants the platform to be a destination for wide-ranging discourse and disagreement.
""I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,"" he wrote.
Mr. Musk said after the deal was announced that he wants to make Twitter a better user experience, in part by adding new features and fighting spam. The billionaire, who is also chief executive of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., has a record of challenging conventions in disparate industries.
Twitter is facing significant business challenges and has already embarked on a turnaround plan after a fight with activist investor Elliott Management Corp. about two years ago. Twitter said a little over a year ago that it aimed to at least double its revenue to $7.5 billion by the end of 2023 and reach at least 315 million so-called monetizable daily active users at that time.
To reach that latter goal, the company would need to sharply increase its user growth, which has been in the single-digit percentage points for most of the past few years.
Among the other issues Mr. Musk will face is whether to allow Donald Trump back on Twitter, after the Republican former president's personal account was ""permanently suspended"" by the company last year in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of his supporters seeking to interfere with the certification of President Biden's 2020 election win.
Mr. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he had no plans to return to Twitter and would instead use his startup Truth Social as his preferred social-media network.
At an all-hands employee meeting on Monday afternoon, CEO Parag Agrawal said that there are no layoffs planned and that the company's priorities aren't changing before the deal closes, according to a person who heard the remarks. Mr. Agrawal said that once Mr. Musk takes over, ""we don't know what direction the company may go,"" the person said.
Mr. Agrawal said Mr. Musk agreed to convert employee stockholdings to cash once the deal closes and pay them out on the existing vesting schedule, the person said.
Bret Taylor, Twitter's independent board chairman, said the deal reflects the best outcome for shareholders.
The San Francisco-based social-media company had been expected to rebuff the offer, which Mr. Musk made April 14 without saying how he would pay for it. A day after the unsolicited offer, Twitter adopted a so-called poison pill, designed to make it more difficult for Mr. Musk to reach more than a 15% stake in the company.
Twitter changed its posture after Mr. Musk detailed elements of his financing plan. On April 21, he said he had $46.5 billion in funding lined up. Twitter shares rose sharply, and executives opened the door to negotiations.
Twitter shares rose 5.7% Monday to close at $51.70 each. The stock has been an anemic performer in an era of huge returns for technology companies. Its shares jumped on their first day of trading in 2013 to close at $44.90, within a dollar of where they were when Mr. Musk made his approach.
But since Mr. Musk disclosed a roughly 9% stake in the company in early April, Twitter shares have climbed 32%. That has pushed Twitter higher on a year-to-date basis, outpacing other technology companies and the broader market.
The turnabout on Twitter's part comes after Mr. Musk met privately Friday with several shareholders to extol his proposal while repeating that the board has a ""yes-or-no"" decision, people familiar with the discussions said.
Mr. Musk, with over 82 million Twitter followers, has long used the platform to pronounce his views on everything from space travel to cryptocurrencies. In January, he began buying Twitter stock, becoming the single-largest individual investor with a more than 9% stake by April.
He has previously used Twitter to escalate a conflict with the Securities and Exchange Commission after the agency opened a probe into some of his recent stock sales, and he often blasts his critics on the social network.
Taking Twitter private would allow Mr. Musk to make changes without the scrutiny public companies typically are under from their shareholders. He also has said he wants to retain as many shareholders as possible.
Twitter, at the beginning of April, invited Mr. Musk to join its board -- which would have prevented him from owning more than 14.9% of the stock. Mr. Musk initially agreed and then rejected the offer.
Mr. Musk's proposed changes for the platform include softening its stance on content moderation, creating an edit feature for tweets, making Twitter's algorithm open source -- which would allow people outside the company to view it and suggest changes -- and relying less on advertising, among other ideas.
Mr. Musk, a self-described ""free speech absolutist,"" said in a recent interview at a TED conference that he sees Twitter as the ""de facto town square.""
Twitter should be more cautious when deciding to take down tweets or permanently ban users' accounts, Mr. Musk said, pointing to temporary suspensions as a better solution.
Mr. Musk said he also wants the platform to be more transparent when it takes action that amplifies or reduces a tweet's reach. He said he wasn't certain how some of those ideas would be implemented.
Twitter has spent years advocating for what it calls healthier discourse on its platform and adding content moderation, arguing at least in part that it is good for business. The company also introduced features that have been gaining some traction with users, including Twitter Spaces, which allows people to host live audio conversations with one another.
Mr. Musk has said he wants Twitter to rely less on advertising -- which provided about 90% of its revenue in 2021 -- and shift its model more toward subscriptions. The platform currently offers a subscription-based service called Twitter Blue, which gives customers premium features like ""undo tweet"" for $2.99 a month. He suggested removing all ads on Twitter as part of the subscription offerings.
Mr. Musk also floated the idea of cutting staff, shuttering the headquarters building and not giving the board of directors a salary. The latter could save about $3 million a year alone, he said. His other proposed changes for Twitter include trying to stop spam and scam bots and allowing for longer tweets. The current limit is 280 characters.
On Thursday, Twitter is scheduled to announce its first-quarter earnings. The company said it no longer planned to hold a call with analysts that day.

144,26-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk Bets Twitter Users Will Like a More Freewheeling Platform; Billionaire plans to scale back content constraints, but how Twitter operates won't be entirely up to him",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2655177867/BFD812D457A14912PQ/635?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has pledged to adopt a more hands-off approach to speech on Twitter Inc., but a warning Tuesday from a top European regulator shows it may not be as simple as shelling out $44 billion for the social-media platform and taking it private.
The internal market commissioner at the European Union cautioned Mr. Musk a day after he struck a deal to buy Twitter that he would need to follow the bloc's new rules on content moderation.
EU regulators are but one of a number of forces—advertisers, users, law makers, activists—who can complicate Mr. Musk's attempt to, in effect, return the platform to its early days, when its executives publicly described it as ""the free speech wing of the free speech party.""
In the years since, Twitter and other mainstream social-media platforms have imposed policies and practices designed to make them less susceptible to harassment, manipulation and falsehoods they see as harmful. Those measures aim to make the services more appealing to advertisers seeking a safe venue, and to better accommodate politicians and regulators arguing that the platforms are responsible for all of their content. But the moves have alienated some users who, like Mr. Musk, say they go overboard.
How Twitter operates won't be entirely up to Mr. Musk.
""Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules—regardless of their shareholding,"" Thierry Breton, the EU regulator, wrote Tuesday on Twitter. ""Mr Musk knows this well.""
Mr. Breton expressed confidence that Twitter, under Mr. Musk's ownership, would conform to the bloc's new rules, which still need formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries.
Mr. Musk's planned changes at Twitter, and the response, will be closely watched. Twitter is smaller and less profitable than other social-media companies. It claims 217 million so-called monetizable daily users compared with 1.9 billion daily users for Meta Platforms Inc.'s core Facebook platform and a billion-plus monthly users for TikTok. But Twitter users include media personalities, politicians, activists and tech aficionados who help shape social discourse.
""It has influence way beyond its user base and way beyond its valuation, and so we care about it,"" said David Kaye, former United Nations special rapporteur focused on free speech and now a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.

Mr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. as well as the world's richest person , is one of Twitter's most prominent users, employing the platform for everything from promoting his companies to battling rivals and critics. In Monday's deal announcement, he said he wants to open up Twitter's algorithms to public scrutiny, ""defeat"" spammers and authenticate users' identities.
 PHOTOS: How Elon Musk Made the Fortune He'll Need to Buy Twitter 
On Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he views ""free speech"" as that permitted by the law—a far broader definition of what is allowable than most major social networks have adopted. ""I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,"" he said in a tweet . ""If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.""
Some industry executives and analysts say Mr. Musk is in for an awakening . Reversing Twitter's efforts risks stoking advertisers' worries about the placement of their ads, potentially pushing them toward competitors like Snap Inc. and Meta, said Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank.
""Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?"" he said. ""If someone falls overboard on a cruise ship, do you want your vacation message being advertised against that content?"" He said less moderation could also drive away some users, potentially slowing growth.
In the company's early years, Twitter executives were loath to remove content unless it broke local laws. The platform often took a hands-off approach even to content from officially designated terrorist groups, drawing criticism from researchers, lawmakers and victims' families.
It stepped up moderation over the years , removing accounts connected to the terrorist group ISIS in 2014, for example. That accelerated during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential race, which saw a jump in complaints about white nationalists and others using the platform to attack and harass minority users.
Other industry leaders who favored looser policies, including Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, have gradually embraced more intervention. Platforms including Meta's Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest Inc. and Reddit Inc. all have added staff or bolstered rules to monitor their content, though each draws the lines differently.
Their efforts target a range of potentially problematic content, from hate speech and false information about elections to what they see as fringe views on health, along with other issues the platforms consider harmful. Pinterest recently banned posts that it deems to contain misinformation about climate change .
Twitter and other platforms also have systems allowing users to report claims of abuse by other users, which can lead to account suspensions that some of those involved say can be arbitrary or unfair.
More moderating has required complex, and often confusing, guidelines for employees and users. Such efforts have led to some divisive decisions, including bans by Twitter and Facebook of then-President Donald Trump for posts encouraging the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to halt certification of President Biden's electoral victory.
Those bans were widely praised on the left and by some Republicans. But Mr. Trump and his supporters blasted it and have backed rival social-media apps with fewer restrictions that so far have gained limited traction, including Parler, Gab, and Gettr, which former Trump adviser Jason Miller launched last year .
Many in the Trump camp have voiced support for Mr. Musk's planned Twitter acquisition, though Mr. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he doesn't plan to return to the platform and would instead use his social-media startup , Truth Social.
Devin Nunes, CEO of Truth Social, lauded Monday's Twitter deal, though he said he doesn't see the platform, even under Mr. Musk, as a direct competitor because of their different target audiences. ""This is a great, great day,"" the Trump ally and former GOP congressman said. ""Finally we're getting some movement in the right direction here in terms of opening the internet back up and giving people their voice back.""
Twitter's existing policies haven't brought about huge financial success; it has struggled to deliver consistent profits. And losing advertisers might not be a problem for Mr. Musk. He has said he wants the platform to rely less on advertising —which accounts for about 90% of its revenue, totaling $5.1 billion last year—and to focus more on a subscription business model . The platform currently offers Twitter Blue, a $2.99-a-month subscription service that gives customers access to premium features.
Despite Mr. Trump's comments Monday, many observers and Twitter employees are focused on Mr. Musk's handling of the former president's account as a potential indicator of his plans. During an all-hands meeting on Monday, Twitter CEO Parag Agarwal was asked if the company might reinstate Mr. Trump once Mr. Musk's ownership is completed. Mr. Agarwal said it wasn't clear.

145,26-Apr-22,Boston Globe (Online),"Tips and tricks on how Elon Musk can make Twitter, well, not the worst",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2655123270/BFD812D457A14912PQ/684?accountid=13946,".@elonmusk has shut up the doubters. #twittersold.Ordinary billionaires buy sports teams or newspapers or private islands. There's nothing wrong with that. @Red Sox @bostonglobe. But it just won't do for the capo di tutti capitalists.No, the vanity purchase in 2022 for the man who can buy anything is, obviously, @twitter. Elon Musk love-hates the thought-sharing network so much he bought the company. #RIPvictorkiam.Why? Because he could.But there's more to it than just wanting to silence all the haters who questioned whether he was serious — or could pull it off.The Oracle of Austin, well, he just loves, loves, loves to stir things up on Twitter. So much so that he struck a deal on Monday to acquire the company for $44 billion. He's using other people's money for more than half the purchase price because, you know, Musk is crazy, but he's not stupid.The @Tesla and @SpaceX boss is a professional Twitter user, with more than 84 million followers, and he wants to make Twitter “better.” Or maybe just not suck so much.“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” he said Monday in a statement. “I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.”All good ideas. Imagine how awesome Twitter would be if there were no limits on what you could say!But dare I say that Musk is thinking too small? He's coming at the problem from a user's perspective. An edit button (hey, Slack has it). Open source algorithms — brilliant, whatever they are.What Twitter also needs is more users and bigger profits. Facebook, for all its problems, is much bigger. TikTok is much cooler. (Elon, just ask Grimes.)Will the world's richest man have the time to fix Twitter users' experience and make it more profitable?Of course not. Musk already has two full-time jobs: Twitter troll and #crypto evangelist/market manipulator. And there are the many side hustles, including, but not limited to, saving the planet from global warming, colonizing Mars, and boring huge underground tunnels for. . . the hell of it?That's why I'm making myself available to serve as Twitter CEO to Musk's chairman. I'd be his perfect Number 2 (not that I think he's Dr. Evil).If you check my LinkedIn profile, you'll notice that I have never run a major corporation. Nor do I understand algorithms, advertising, or big data — which, apparently, are all important to Twitter's business model. I'm barely on Twitter — who do you gotta know to get verified? — and most of my followers are porn bots.But, if Musk taps me for the job, I'd be laser-focused on monetizing Twitter's users in ways that should have been obvious to the soon-to-be former management. For example:* No subscriptions; they're so pandemic (see: @Netflix's stock price). Instead, I'd eliminate the 280-character limit on each tweet and charge a penny per character, with no cap on a tweet's length. It'll be $1 per character for all politicians and celebrities. Memes will cost extra, like carry-on baggage.* Premium tweet placement. I'm sure Twitter's developers can come up with an automated auction system for users to buy their way to the top of users' feeds, just like @Google does with its unbiased search. Twitter is leaving billions of dollars on the table — a fortune that could go into Musk's retirement plan or help him pay the mortgage.* Higher rates for misinformation, disinformation, hate speech, and incitements to overthrow the government. Free speech doesn't have to be free!* Fees for retweets and likes. Twitter should get a cut when a tweet goes viral.* Pay for amnesty™. This, I have to admit, is a grand slam. I'd permit banned users to buy their way back onto Twitter. The fee will be a sliding scale based on the number of followers the individual had before getting kicked off, starting at $50 million. Cash or crypto only..@elonmusk, I know you're a busy man. But just think: If I tweeted this column under my new business model, Twitter would have booked $44 in revenue — plus any follow-on retweet/like fees. Of course, not all tweets would be this long-winded. But when you are multiplying by 500 million tweets per day, we're talking real money. Even for you.#Make Twitter Great Again."
146,27-Apr-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Tesla Shares Sink 12% On Musk Twitter Deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2655432428/BFD812D457A14912PQ/58?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc. shares logged their biggest one-day drop in more than a year after founder Elon Musk said he would buy Twitter Inc. in a $44 billion deal.
The shares slid 12% to $876.42 and were the worst performers in the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index Tuesday. The stock had its worst day since September 2020, when it fell 21% after it was passed over for inclusion in the S&P 500 index.
The stock is now down around 23% since April 4, when Mr. Musk first disclosed a position in the social-media company. Mr. Musk's takeover deal came together quickly and surprised shareholders and market watchers. It also spurred volatility in Twitter and Tesla shares.
The takeover adds to a list of high-profile ventures that Mr. Musk has juggled over the past decade. For more than a dozen years, he has led Tesla and rocket-and-satellite company SpaceX in addition to launching startups on the side.
Twitter will now account for around a sixth of his net worth, which is intertwined with his Tesla shares. Roughly $60 billion of his Tesla stock, about a third of his holdings, are collateral for bank loans. Mr. Musk also needs $21 billion in cash, which could mean selling some of his Tesla stockholdings, to close the deal.
Mr. Musk appears to have a sizable cushion before he would have to post more collateral for the $12.5 billion in bank loans used to purchase Twitter. His agreement with lenders indicates that he must post $100 in Tesla shares as collateral for every $20 in borrowings, leading to a loan-to-value ratio of 20%. That amounts to around $62 billion worth of Tesla shares to back the loans.
Mr. Musk's agreement with lenders states that if on any day the value of his loan makes up more than 35% of the collateral he has posted on the borrowings, he would face a margin call. He would have to sell some of his shares, prepay the loans or post additional collateral. He would hit that threshold if the value of the posted shares tumbled to roughly $36 billion, akin to around a 43% drop.
That means if the value of those Tesla shares fell roughly 43%, he would face a margin call.
Tesla stock is volatile and is known for its giant one-day moves, swings that have made the company a favorite bet for options traders looking to profit from the turbulence. Options on Tesla shares were widely traded Tuesday. Traders had spent more money on bearish options that would typically pay out if the shares fell further than calls tied to a jump, according to Shift Search by Vesica Technologies.
Tuesday's losses have dragged the stock down around 17% for the year, compared with the broader market's roughly 12% decline.

147,27-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),Tech Earnings Are a Reflection of the Postpandemic Economy. Facebook's Parent Is Next.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2655520925/BFD812D457A14912PQ/409?accountid=13946,"Anyone reading the tea leaves from Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft's earnings on Tuesday will be struck by what seems to be working for the two companies.
Google's ad sales were hurt by economic turmoil. With consumers reluctant to spend big amid surging energy prices—not to mention the Russia-Ukraine war and rising interest rates—it makes sense that companies are also reluctant to splash out on advertising campaigns.
Yet Google's cloud-computing products, which help people in the new hybrid working environment, performed well.
Likewise for Microsoft's Azure cloud business. That is running strong and is projected to keep doing so, boosting the company's stock while Alphabet's slipped.
What does that mean for Facebook parent Meta Platforms, which reports results after the close? Well, like Google, Facebook mainly sells ads. Changes in Apple's privacy rules give Facebook's business particular problems. And the previous quarter wasn't great. With expectations already low, there is still room for a surprise, but it seems unlikely that the news will be as good as it was for Microsoft.
Twitter, also reliant on ad sales , reports this week as well. Thanks to Tesla CEO Elon Musk's buyout bid, the company doesn't have to worry too much about the market's reaction.
The Nasdaq closed at its lowest level since 2020 on Tuesday, but markets appear to have found a floor. What happens next will depend on the balance of the forces shaping the postpandemic world.

Earnings Reports Reveal a Tale of Two Tech Giants
Alphabet and Microsoft kicked off tech earnings by reporting divergent results, with Alphabet delivering a disappointment and Microsoft scoring an unexpectedly strong quarter. Tech investors had been on edge all day, pulling the Nasdaq down 4% before the reports came out.
* Alphabet's $24.62 earnings per share fell short of the expected $25.91. Revenue also fell slightly short at $68 billion versus $68.1 billion expected. Sales growth of 23% slowed compared with the same quarter last year as global turmoil hit digital ad spending. It was the lowest growth rate since 2020.
* Google Cloud sales rose 44% over last year, to $5.8 billion, generating an operating loss of $931 million. Alphabet is spending $5.4 billion to buy cybersecurity firm Mandiant to better automate cyber defenses, The Wall Street Journal reported.
* Microsoft reported EPS of $2.22 and revenue of $49.4 billion. Revenue in its commercial cloud business, including Azure, Office 365 Commercial, LinkedIn commercial, and Dynamics 365, rose 32%, to $23.4 billion.
* The company's personal-computing segment featuring Windows, Surface, and Xbox, reported $14.5 billion of revenue, which surpassed its own guidance and analyst expectations.
What's Next: Microsoft's chief financial officer, Amy Hood, projected better-than-expected numbers for the June quarter in its productivity and business processes and intelligent-cloud segments. Her guidance implies a revenue range for the quarter of $52.4 billion to $53.2 billion, in line with analysts' expectations.

Musk's Twitter Deal Includes $1 Billion Breakup Fee
Elon Musk will have to pay Twitter a $1 billion fee if the Tesla CEO terminates his $44 billion cash deal to buy the social-media platform, Twitter said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.
* The fee would have to be paid under certain circumstances, such as if Musk isn't able to secure enough equity, debt and or margin to finance the acquisition, the Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed.
* Twitter, which is subject to ""no-shop"" restrictions preventing it from talking to other suitors, will be required to pay the same $1 billion fee under certain circumstances, according to the same filing. These include Twitter accepting a competing acquisition proposal or recommending shareholders vote against Musk's offer.
* On Monday, Twitter's board agreed to Musk's $54.20-a-share cash offer for the social-media company in one of the biggest ever leveraged buyout deals. Musk has raised $25.5 billion in debt—including a margin loan of $12.5 billion secured against his shares in Tesla—from a group of banks led by Morgan Stanley.
What's Next: Twitter searched all around the globe for a second bidder but failed to discover one, said Dan Ives, a senior equity research analyst at Wedbush Securities, adding: ""They came up empty-handed."" So, even without the penalty of a breakup, another bidder would have been unlikely to emerge for Twitter.

Robinhood Cutting Staff After Period of Hyper Growth
Robinhood Markets will cut 9% of its full-time staff after a period of extraordinary growth during last year's meme-stock trading frenzy that helped balloon its employee base nearly six times in 18 months, to 3,800 people.
* Co-founder and CEO Vlad Tenev said on his blog on Tuesday, in a post that appeared after a companywide meeting, that the rapid expansion resulted in duplicated roles and added complexity.
* He called the cuts a ""deliberate step"" to keep Robinhood on track, which includes introducing new products for its brokerage, cryptocurrency, and spending and saving functions. The digital trading company is also continuing to expand internationally.
* Tenev said Robinhood has been responding to changes in the way customers invest, noting the current climate of geopolitical conflict, economic uncertainty, and inflation. He added the company has prioritized opportunities for automation and operational efficiency.
* The post also said Robinhood has $6 billion of cash on its books. Robinhood reported $6.25 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of the end of 2021, according to its year-end earnings report.
What's Next: Robinhood is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday after the closing bell. It will be the quarter that compares to the height of the meme-stock trading of early last year, potentially making difficult comparisons in measurements such as monthly active users.

Airlines Maneuver on Flight Schedules Ahead of Summer
United Airlines added international flights, while JetBlue Airways curbed its schedule ahead of the busy summer travel season. Delta Air Lines will be the first major U.S. airline to start flight attendant pay at the time when boarding begins, instead of starting the clock after the cabin doors close.
* United Airlines Holdings will start or resume 30 European flights from mid-April through early June, including new nonstops to London, Milan, Munich, Zurich, and Nice, France—the largest trans-Atlantic expansion in its history.
* JetBlue Airways is trimming its summer schedule by more than 10% to help restore operational reliability and build more flexibility into its schedule. JetBlue plans to increase capacity 0% to 5% in 2022, compared with 2019 levels, down from previous plans for 11% to 15% growth.
* Delta's new boarding pay for flight attendants—half their hourly rate—kicks in June 2 and comes amid a unionization effort. Delta also added extra time to board, extending it to 40 minutes for single-aisle aircraft, according to a memo reviewed by Barron's.
* The Association of Flight Attendants, representing cabin crews at United Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Alaska Air, Hawaiian, and Frontier, said ""management is getting nervous."" Delta said its move is a testament to Delta's longstanding commitment to deliver industry-leading pay.
What's Next: JetBlue said it has improved staffing, including 5,000 crew members and 1,100 customer service workers. It will proactively cancel flights ahead of bad weather or air-traffic control issues, and increase preventative maintenance to avoid equipment-related delays and cancellations.

Pfizer Seeks Approval on Boosters for School-Aged Children
Pfizer and BioNTech asked the Food and Drug Administration to approve Covid-19 booster shots for 5- to 11-year-olds, saying data from Phase 2 and 3 trials found the third dose elicited a strong immune response in the age group with no new safety issues. They will also ask the European Medicines Agency.
* The Biden administration is buying 20 million doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 pill Paxlovid, which was found to lower the risk of hospitalization or death by 90%, and doubling the number of pharmacies and other sites where people at high risk for severe Covid-19 can get the drug.
* U.S. hospitalizations are at pandemic lows and daily deaths have declined to about 300, but Covid-19 cases are rising, and the risk of potential surges and new variants remains, White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said. The BA.2 Omicron subvariant is now 96.8% of circulating viruses.
* The White House repeated its call to Congress to approve additional funding for Covid-19 programs such as purchasing vaccines and treatments to distribute them free. Jha said there is a risk there won't be enough next-generation, variant-specific vaccines for everyone this fall or winter.
* The number of deaths in the U.S. from coronavirus disease is nearing one million, at 988,991, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Epidemiologists consider the total an undercount.
What's Next: Vice President Kamala Harris tested positive for Covid-19, but wasn't in close contact with President Joe Biden. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden still plans to attend the White House Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday and former Vice President Walter Mondale's memorial service in Minneapolis on Sunday.

Dear Quentin,
I am a retired 62-year-old woman. I was widowed in 2006 at the age of 46 and raised my two children (now 24 and 27) on my own. I used my husband's life insurance money (about $500,000) to maintain our home, provide child care, and get both children through college without student loans.
I saved through my 401(k) at work. I have a small pension (about $24,000 a year), an investment account valued at $2.5 million (from which I'm drawing about 2% a year for living expenses), a home valued at about $400,000 and no debt.
I remarried six years ago. He was divorced—his wife left him and their three children and he raised them alone. He has a pension that is about 2.5 times the size of mine and is starting to collect Social Security. He also has about $500,000 in retirement.
We split living expenses, but we no longer pay $550 per month as the mortgage is paid off. However, we've been doing a lot of improvements to the house. Some are improvements we both wanted.
I'm spending a fortune on home maintenance and improvements. I realize that my second husband is essentially living in my house for free. He is very handy and does a lot of small repairs and maintenance himself, which I greatly appreciate.
I also realize that my net worth is greater than his. What is fair? Should he pay rent or some other costs associated with the maintenance? Or should I suck it up and pay for anything house-related and just appreciate the maintenance work he does for me?
What is your advice for an equitable arrangement?
Thanks so much.

148,27-Apr-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Stocks Close Higher After Tech-Led Selloff; Investors digest earnings from major companies; Meta Platforms jumps in after-hours trading,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2655432478/BFD812D457A14912PQ/454?accountid=13946,"U.S. stocks edged higher in choppy trading Wednesday, clawing back some of their losses after selling off sharply a day earlier.
It was a day of fluctuations, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting session highs in the early afternoon before paring their gains into the close. The Dow industrials ranged about 588 points between their high and low of the day.
The S&P 500 gained 8.76 points, or 0.2%, to close at 4183.96. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 61.75 points, or 0.2%, to 33301.93. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.81 points, or less than 0.1%, to 12488.93.
Investors said they saw the moves higher as a temporary relief rally after Tuesday's selloff, when the Nasdaq recorded its largest one-day percentage decline since September 2020 and the Dow dropped more than 800 points . Analysts and money managers have been digesting earnings reports and weighing concerns about inflation, the prospect of rapid policy tightening by the Federal Reserve and the spread of Covid-19 in China .
""Stocks have been so weak so far this month I believe investors are seeing some value in the current pricing,"" said Tracie McMillion, head of global asset allocation strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
Major U.S. stock indexes remain down substantially for the year, with the S&P 500 down 12% and the Nasdaq Composite down 20%. On Tuesday, the Nasdaq closed at its lowest level since December 2020, wiping out the gains it notched in 2021.
The market is in the thick of corporate earnings season. Analysts expect that profits from companies in the S&P 500 grew 7.5% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to FactSet.
Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said she sees the next moves in the stock market as either sideways or down.
Earnings are ""supporting the market to some extent, but I don't think it's enough to support it higher,"" Ms. Shah said. She said her team has moved to a neutral recommendation on their overall equity positions.
""The risks are just piling up,"" she said. ""We don't want to be picking up pennies in front of the steamroller.""
Many big companies are reporting earnings this week. Shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 19% in after-hours trading after the company beat earnings expectations . Twitter, which this week agreed to sell itself for $44 billion to Elon Musk , is set to report Thursday.
About 80% of S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far have surpassed analysts' estimates, FactSet data show. Still, Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, said investors remain focused on a number of wide-ranging issues weighing on markets.
""Markets are mostly focused on some of the macro concerns around aggressive tighter Fed policy, as well as this global growth scare that's playing out,"" she said.
Many of those concerns have driven the dollar to its highest level in more than two years. The dollar tends to strengthen when the global economy sours and when investors expect U.S. growth to outpace the rest of the world. Rising interest rates in the U.S. also typically benefit the greenback as higher rates attract yield-seeking investors to the currency.
The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against a basket of others, rose 0.5% to 95.19, its highest closing value since March 2020. It has risen in 18 of the past 20 trading days.
In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 2.817% on Wednesday from 2.773% on Tuesday. Recently, investors have sold bonds in anticipation of higher interest rates, and the yield on the benchmark note remains close to its highest level since 2018. Bond yields and prices move inversely.
 Natural-gas prices in Europe rose 4.1% after Russia said it would halt gas flows to Poland and Bulgaria over their refusal to pay on Moscow's new terms. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose 0.3% to $105.32 a barrel.
Among individual stocks, Tesla shares added $5.09, or 0.6%, to $881.51, recouping some of their losses after tumbling 12% Tuesday, their biggest one-day drop in more than a year. Twitter fell $1.04, or 2.1%, to $48.64, about 10% below the $54.20 per-share-price that Elon Musk and Twitter agreed to in their deal to take the company private.
Boeing shares lost $12.58, or 7.5%, to $154.46. The company posted a $1.24 billion quarterly loss and again pushed back the expected first delivery of its new 777X twin-aisle jet.
Microsoft jumped $13.00, or 4.8%, to $283.22 after the company on Tuesday reported higher revenue and profit last quarter as demand for its cloud services and software continued to climb . Shares of Google parent Alphabet fell $87.11, or 3.7%, to $2,285.89 after the technology behemoth posted slower sales growth amid disruptions in digital advertising spending .
Chipotle Mexican Grill shares added $37.42, or 2.6%, to $1,475.63 after the burrito chain said total revenue increased 16% last quarter amid higher food, beverage and packaging costs—which the company said was partially offset by menu-price increases.
Lucid Group shares gained 43 cents, or 2.4%, to $18.07 after the company late Tuesday said the government of Saudi Arabia had agreed to purchase up to 100,000 vehicles over a 10-year period.
Robinhood Markets shares fell 49 cents, or 4.9%, to $9.51 after the online brokerage said it was laying off 9% of its full-time employees. The company is set to report earnings Thursday.
European stocks rose, with the Stoxx Europe 600 closing up 0.7%. Major markets in Asia were mixed, with benchmarks in Japan and South Korea falling more than 1% and Chinese indexes gaining.
The CSI 300 index of the largest stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen rose 2.9%, recouping some of its recent losses. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index was up 0.1%.
The rebound came after China on Tuesday reported its lowest tally of Covid-19 cases in three weeks , and President Xi Jinping highlighted the importance of infrastructure for economic growth, singling out transport, energy and water conservation. Machinery and building-materials stocks jumped.

149,27-Apr-22,The Times - Tribune,'Free speech' might cost Musk,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2715422877/BFD812D457A14912PQ/552?accountid=13946,"Like many Americans, Elon Musk seems to think that “free speech” means speaking without consequence. He might learn the hard way, though, that acquiring the social media platform Twitter could have costs well beyond the astounding $46 billion he will pay for it.
Musk, who has become the world’s richest person by founding and building extraordinary enterprises including Tesla and SpaceX, says that he is a “free speech absolutist.” Calling the site “the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” he thinks the modest efforts that Twitter employs to warn users of hate speech, misinformation and much else are too restrictive.
Even so, Twitter is a reliable distributor of bogus information. If Musk adopts an anything-goes policy, the site will become a swamp.
But free speech has consequences. Just before his Twitter deal, the European Union adopted rules barring social media platforms from posting content that promotes terrorism, child sexual abuse, hate speech and commercial scams.
Musk also wants to expand Twitter’s market to China, which is crucial to his other businesses. But the Chinese Communist Party does not share Musk’s professed zeal for unfettered free speech.
If Musk allows Twitter to become a misinformation swamp, that could well alienate affluent, well-educated customers who buy Tesla electric vehicles — who soon will have an array of competitive options.
Social media platforms already have played an outsized role in coarsening public discourse, casting doubt on proven facts, and diminishing democratic processes. Musk risks making it worse."
150,27-Apr-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Hands-Off Approach to Twitter Draws EU Regulator's Warning,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2655432491/BFD812D457A14912PQ/631?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has pledged to adopt a more hands-off approach to speech on Twitter Inc., but a warning Tuesday from a top European regulator shows it might not be as simple as shelling out $44 billion for the social-media platform and taking it private.
The internal market commissioner at the European Union cautioned Mr. Musk a day after he struck a deal to buy Twitter that he would need to follow the bloc's new rules on content moderation.
EU regulators are but one of a number of forces -- advertisers, users, lawmakers, activists -- who can complicate Mr. Musk's attempt to, in effect, return the platform to its early days, when its executives publicly described it as ""the free speech wing of the free speech party.""
In the years since, Twitter and other mainstream social-media platforms have imposed policies and practices designed to make them less susceptible to harassment, manipulation and falsehoods they see as harmful. Those measures aim to make the services more appealing to advertisers seeking a safe venue, and to better accommodate politicians and regulators arguing that the platforms are responsible for all of their content. Some users, like Mr. Musk, said they go overboard.
How Twitter operates won't be entirely up to Mr. Musk.
""Be it cars or social media, any company operating in Europe needs to comply with our rules -- regardless of their shareholding,"" Thierry Breton, the EU regulator, wrote Tuesday on Twitter. ""Mr Musk knows this well.""
Mr. Breton expressed confidence that Twitter, under Mr. Musk's ownership, would conform to the bloc's new rules, which still need formal approval from the EU Parliament and representatives from EU countries.
Mr. Musk's planned changes at Twitter, and the response, will be closely watched. Twitter is smaller and less profitable than other social-media companies. It claims 217 million so-called monetizable daily users, compared with 1.9 billion daily users for Meta Platforms Inc.'s core Facebook platform and a billion-plus monthly users for TikTok. But Twitter users include media personalities, politicians, activists and tech aficionados who help shape social discourse.
""It has influence way beyond its user base and way beyond its valuation, and so we care about it,"" said David Kaye, former United Nations special rapporteur focused on free speech and now a law professor at the University of California, Irvine.
Mr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. as well as the world's richest person, is one of Twitter's most prominent users, employing the platform for everything from promoting his companies to battling rivals and critics. In Monday's deal announcement, he said he wants to open up Twitter's algorithms to public scrutiny, ""defeat"" spammers and authenticate users' identities.
On Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he views ""free speech"" as that permitted by the law -- a far broader definition of what is allowable than most major social networks have adopted. ""I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law,"" he wrote in a tweet. ""If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.""
Some industry executives and analysts said Mr. Musk is in for an awakening. Reversing Twitter's efforts risks stoking advertisers' worries about the placement of their ads, potentially pushing them toward competitors like Snap Inc. and Meta, said Ben Black, co-head of internet research at Deutsche Bank.
""Do you really want to have your Mercedes-Benz commercial against a beheading?"" he said. ""If someone falls overboard on a cruise ship, do you want your vacation message being advertised against that content?"" He said less moderation could also drive away some users, potentially slowing growth.
In the company's early years, Twitter executives were loath to remove content unless it broke local laws. The platform often took a hands-off approach even to content from officially designated terrorist groups, drawing criticism from researchers, lawmakers and victims' families.
It stepped up moderation over the years, removing accounts connected to the terrorist group ISIS in 2014, for example. That accelerated during and after the 2016 U.S. presidential race, which saw a jump in complaints about white nationalists and others using the platform to attack and harass minority users.
Other industry leaders who favored looser policies, including Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, have gradually embraced more intervention. Platforms including Meta's Facebook and Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest Inc. and Reddit Inc. all have added staff or bolstered rules to monitor content, though each draws the lines differently.
Their efforts target a range of potentially problematic content, from hate speech and false information about elections to what they see as fringe views on health, along with other issues the platforms consider harmful.
Twitter and other platforms also have systems allowing users to report claims of abuse by other users, which can lead to account suspensions that some of those involved have said can be arbitrary or unfair.
More moderating has required complex, and often confusing, guidelines for employees and users. Such efforts have led to some divisive decisions, including bans by Twitter and Facebook of then-President Donald Trump for posts encouraging the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, seeking to halt certification of President Biden's electoral victory.
Mr. Trump, a Republican, and his supporters have backed rival social-media apps with fewer restrictions that so far have gained limited traction, including Parler, Gab, and Gettr, which former Trump adviser Jason Miller launched last year.
Mr. Trump told Fox News on Monday that he doesn't plan to return to the platform and would instead use his social-media startup, Truth Social. Despite those comments Monday, many observers and Twitter employees are focused on Mr. Musk's handling of the former president's account as a potential indicator of his plans.
During an all-hands meeting on Monday, Twitter CEO Parag Agarwal was asked if the company might reinstate Mr. Trump once Mr. Musk's ownership is completed. Mr. Agarwal said it wasn't clear.

151,27-Apr-22,Boston Globe,Big changes may be coming to the platform — and perhaps the Web,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2655384811/BFD812D457A14912PQ/689?accountid=13946,"After a whirlwind courtship, Twitter agreed on Monday to sell the company to Elon Musk for about $44 billion. The takeover will likely lead to big changes in how the service works — and who is allowed on it. It could also help boost efforts to build a social media rival with less concentrated ownership, kicking off a trend of decentralized Web apps.Musk, the world's richest person and the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, said he planned to emphasize free speech and new features on the platform.“Twitter has tremendous potential — I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it,"" Musk said in a statement after the deal was announced.As the new owner, Musk could change policies which banned former president Donald Trump and others who supported the Jan. 6 insurrection from the platform. While he hasn't addressed the issue directly, Musk said in an April 14 interview at the TED conference that “if it's a grey area, let the tweet exist."" (Trump may not want to come back, however, telling Fox News on Monday that he will stick with his own Truth Social app.)Although Twitter's content is largely unregulated in the United States, any Musk moves to remove moderation controls and allow hate speech or other offensive fare could run into issues in Europe, which imposed greater restrictions on social media last week. It could also alienate major advertisers who provide the bulk of the service's revenue.“We expect advertisers will be less willing to spend on Twitter if Elon Musk removes content moderation in order to promote free speech,"" analyst Michael Nathanson at MoffettNathanson wrote. “In this scenario, we believe advertisers will look to other platforms to build brand awareness.""In tweets and recent interviews, Musk has outlined a wide variety of potential feature changes as well. He has supported adding a way for users to edit tweets after they are posted, banning bots that spam users, and allowing everyone to see the proprietary algorithms the service uses to rank and distribute posts.But trying to ban bots while also “open sourcing"" Twitter's algorithm wouldn't work, Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, warned. “You cannot have both of these things at once and I think this accurately describes how inconsistent and nonsensical his intentions are,"" she tweeted, since spammers would use insights from the algorithm to improve their tactics.Musk's main goals also do not appear to focus on making the service profitable. “This is not a way to make money,"" he said at the TED conference. “I don't care about the economics at all.""In any case, Twitter management is unlikely to survive the takeover. Twitter board chair Bret Taylor told the company's employees the board would be disbanded once the acquisition is completed. And current chief executive Parag Agrawal said he'd have little say in what happens after that. “Once the deal closes, we don't know what direction this company will go in,"" the New York Times reported Agrawal said.Monday's outcome appeared unlikely as little as a week ago, even though Musk had already bought more than 9 percent of Twitter's stock. On April 15, the company's board adopted a shareholder policy known as a poison pill to thwart unwanted takeovers. And Twitter's stock traded well below Musk's April 14 offer price of $54.20 per share, reflecting investors' doubts.That all changed last Thursday when Musk said in a securities filing he had lined up enough loans and personal cash to complete the takeover. That appeared to sway the company's board, which said Monday Musk's offer was “the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders.""One reason why Musk was able to buy the company is that, unlike other Internet giants such as Facebook and Google, Twitter has failed to reap huge profits. Despite having more than 200 million daily users, Twitter lost $221 million last year, and its stock price was barely above its $26 initial public offering price from 2013 before Musk revealed his interest.Musk's emphasis on free speech and potentially relaxing content moderation on Twitter has stirred talk about switching to alternatives. The trend could be similar to the migration that happened after Twitter banned Trump, and many of his supporters decamped to rival services including Parler, MeWe, and Gettr.Those services have struggled to attract anywhere near the amount of users and attention as Twitter. While Twitter's mobile app has been installed 1.2 billion times, MeWe has only 13.3 million worldwide installs, Parler has 11.3 million, and Gettr almost 7 million, according to market research firm SensorTower.But a new mass migration might open the door to a completely different ownership model for a social network.Musk's total control over Twitter, along with Mark Zuckerberg's majority ownership of Facebook, has some in the tech industry looking for an alternative. In the movement known as web3, startups are using the blockchain technology developed for cryptocurrencies to give users of services more say in how those services are managed.Former Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey, worried about the growing demands for regulation, was thinking about decentralizing control of the company's platform back in 2019. The growth of cryptocurrencies was already starting to expand into a wave of startups that used blockchain tech to offer customers ownership, a say in management, and a financial stake in new services. But Dorsey's effort, which would have allowed different groups and companies to create their own customized Twitter feeds, never came to fruition and he stepped down as chief executive last year.Now some venture capitalists, online activists, and entrepreneurs are looking to build something similar to Dorsey's decentralized platform without Twitter's help.“Core internet services shouldn't be owned by individuals or companies,"" Chris Dixon, a partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, tweeted. “They should be owned by communities, as early internet protocols were.""Still, Twitter benefits from the power of network effects since it already has so many users, Kent Bennett, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners in Cambridge, pointed out.“I wouldn't expect anything to displace Twitter unless it had some obvious and significant feature benefits given that everyone is already on Twitter,"" he said. And with Musk at the helm, Twitter could quickly match anything from an upstart rival, Bennett said. “I'd have to imagine they'll be more nimble tomorrow than they were yesterday.""

152,27-Apr-22,Los Angeles Times,"Will Twitter survive Musk? I'll stick around to find out; He is not a benevolent actor, but can't wreck the platform without wrecking what he really cares about: $TWTR.",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2655387767/BFD812D457A14912PQ/691?accountid=13946,"I joined Twitter in April 2007, a year after its founding as a ""microblogging platform."" I didn't give much thought to my username. At first blush, Twitter looked like a place I shouldn't be seen, like a strip club, so I chose an anonymous handle that combined my middle name and birthdate: @page88. I didn't expect I'd be stuck with it for 15 years and counting.
When I learned that Twitter contacts were called followers, I found the notion cult-y and unnerving. My first tweet, ""If they follow, will I lead?"" got no likes.
For two years, I mostly ignored Twitter. Then, in 2009, at the South by Southwest tech conference, in Austin, I thought I saw its purpose. Conference insiders used it compulsively, especially to plan bar meetups.

When in Rome. I sallied forth, seeking a companion to go with me to see Metallica at a 6th Street club. Again: nothing.
Then I gave a conference talk -- and I got what Twitter was really about.
The crowd in the room applauded generously for my presentation, but later I found they'd been live-tweeting it. Sometimes savagely. I was moping when I ran into David Carr, the late media critic who was then my colleague at the New York Times, and he told me to laugh it off: ""People who use Twitter are twits.""
Neither of us quit it, though. I liked Twitter, even if it could be cutting. More often than not, it was perceptive and funny. Early on it seemed clear that people weren't actually tweeting about ""what they had for lunch,"" as the eye-rolling articles had it. Instead, they were chipping off quips and learning a new way not to be a shrinking violet.
I chugged along for a couple of years, tweeting aimlessly about -- I don't really remember. Television shows? Babies? Maybe I did tweet about lunch. When Dick Costolo became Twitter's chief executive in 2010, he admitted to a crowd that he didn't know what Twitter was for. I didn't either.
At 11:11 p.m. on Monday, Costolo, who resigned from Twitter in 2015, tweeted: ""Shoutout to the writer's room at Silicon Valley for tonight's wild episode.""
Costolo was referring to the flurry around the sudden sale of Twitter to Elon Musk, the self-titled ""technoking"" of Tesla, for $44 billion.
Referring to history as though it's a TV series dreamed up in a writer's room is commonplace stuff for Twitter. The meme captures the widespread impression that world events are so speedy and dramatic now that they've just got to be scripted.
Indeed, in a single day, Musk, the loose-cannon industrialist icon who -- well, the controversies are too numerous to mention but they include wide-ranging allegations of horrifying racism -- had swooped in like a 1980s corporate raider and snatched up the company.
On Monday, Erika D. Smith trenchantly observed in this newspaper what many on Twitter fear most about the Musk takeover: In the name of ""free speech"" for right-wingers and trolls, Musk will silence the marginalized voices that are Twitter's soul.
""Consider this the beginning of the end of #BlackTwitter,"" Smith wrote, ""the community of millions that figured out how to turn a nascent social media platform into an indispensable tool for real-world activism, political power and change.""
Smith nailed it. In the last six or seven years, Twitter established an indispensable reason for being, and racist feudalism isn't it. At its best Twitter emboldens non-dominant subcultures -- from socialists to the #bancars crowd to ex-Republicans -- to create subversive commentary, strategy, solidarity.
When Twitter banned then-President Trump from the platform for inciting violence (and sabotaging democracy) on and around Jan. 6, 2021, those other users could tweet and thread with even more verve and nuance, because the bully wasn't sucking up all the air. Now some have predicted that Musk will bring @realDonaldTrump back. (Trump, for his part, has said he'd refuse.)
Although the highest and best uses of Twitter are at risk, fainting-couch despair may not be necessary. Musk is surely not a benevolent actor, but it's probable that he won't be able to wreck Twitter without wrecking the thing he really cares about: $TWTR.
Rick Wilson, author and co-founder of the Lincoln Project, tweeted, ""Call me crazy, but I'm not tearing my (remaining) hair out over this.""
He went on to thread that ""Daddy Musk,"" for all his uninformed bloviating about ""muh 1st Amendment free speech,"" is not going to stop content moderation at Twitter. And if Musk brings Trump back, Wilson added, it would only hurt Trump's political career by putting his worst traits back under klieg lights.
Indeed, Musk is unlikely to nix all content moderation, lest the platform be overrun with smut like the subscription site OnlyFans. And if far-right voices come to pervade Twitter, and it ""gets filled with Holocaust denial, racial revanchism, Bitcoin spam, and Russian propaganda, and Seb Gorka porn"" (as Wilson puts it), the revenge will be swift: ""The market will devalue Twitter.""
I was turning over Wilson's observations when I laughed out loud at ""Seb Gorka porn."" The phrase is vintage Wilson and extremely Twitter. That's why I liked it.
As long as dangerous and ridiculous true-life twits like Gorka -- and Musk -- can be mercilessly satirized on Twitter, I'm staying.

153,27-Apr-22,Tribune - Review / Pittsburgh Tribune - Review,Local experts have mixed reactions to Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2655977310/BFD812D457A14912PQ/693?accountid=13946,"It was Remington shaver spokesman Victor Kiam who famously said, ""I like it so much, I bought the company.""
For Elon Musk, the opposite is true.
The world's richest man, according to Forbes Magazine, Musk reached an agreement to buy Twitter for $44 billion on Monday and then said he wants to own and privatize Twitter because it's not living up to its potential as a platform for free speech.
""It's almost as if we're seeing kind of a version of (the movie) 'Wall Street' being played out,"" said University of Pittsburgh law professor Peter Oh. ""Elon Musk originally wanted to join the board of Twitter. And the board imposed a condition on him that if he was going to be a part of the board, he could not criticize the company.
""So, Musk's conclusion was: If you can't beat the board, you might as well just buy the company.""
The board has approved the transaction. But the sale still needs to be approved by the shareholders who may well have some legitimate concerns about the deal.
For starters, Oh says some financial analysts think Twitter is worth more than what Musk is offering.
And then there are concerns some watchdog organizations have about Musk potentially dismantling protections put in place by Twitter in recent years against disinformation, harassment and abuse.
For his part, Musk, who also owns electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla, said he merely intends to promote free speech on Twitter.
""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,"" Musk said in a Monday statement.
Angelo Carusone, president and CEO of Media Matters for America, sees Musk's strategy as something far more insidious, ""effectively opening the floodgates of hate and lies and using Twitter's position as a market leader to pressure other social media companies to backslide.
""Musk may claim that this is about freedom of speech, but don't be fooled -- this is about ideology.""
Andrew Conte, founding director of the Center for Media Innovation at Point Park University, said Musk's purchase of Twitter definitely raises concerns.
""Any time you take somebody who's already the richest person in the world and give them a megaphone that they can control to say whatever, raises all kinds of concerns,"" Conte said.
And what is the impact on shareholders if disinformation or hate speech is allowed?
""They all have different levels of liability,"" Oh said. ""So when it comes to the shareholders, none of them would be able to be sued in connection with the actual company and its business model for allowing whatever kinds of free speech would be allowed on Twitter.
""The much more likely scenario is that Elon Musk, as the CEO of the corporation, could be sued for whatever particular policies that they decide to go with.""
One of Musk's proposed policies getting a resoundingly positive reaction is his idea to make Twitter's algorithms public. In other words, the rules that computers follow to determine what you see in your Twitter feed should be made known to you.
""That, I think is great,"" said Kathleen Carley, a professor in Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science. ""Right now a lot of the social media companies have various algorithms that they use to do things like decide which material to promote or decide who to recommend to you to follow - or decide which of your messages will go to which of your followers.""
Carley said that right now, it's kind of a guessing game as to what's going on.
""But by making the algorithms public, you make them also accountable because you can then say, aha, here is the bias in this algorithm,"" she said. ""And now you can go in and actually fix it and make the algorithms better.""
Conte said Musk's purchase of Twitter may also have a positive influence on other social media, such as Facebook and TikTok, which skews to a younger demographic.
""Hopefully Musk's leadership of the company will drive innovation and also force other companies like Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook and the folks at TikTok to think about how to make their platforms more engaging,"" said Conte.
For now, though, it seems that it's Twitter that needs to make itself more appealing.
Its user base of more than 200 million is much smaller than those of Facebook and TikTok. And while Twitter is more of a destination for celebrities, journalists, influencers and world leaders, Conte calls it an ""echo chamber.""
He said Twitter needs more ""can't miss"" conversations.
""I'm hoping (Musk's purchase) will rejuvenate Twitter so it's not just journalists talking to each other, but really does become something that the average person turns to on a regular basis,"" Conte said. ""A lot of people don't turn to Twitter first. I know for a lot of my students it's an afterthought compared to Instagram or TikTok. Twitter's gotten a little bit staid and boring.""
One of the criticisms Musk has had about Twitter is that a lot of the people who have the most followers, such as President Obama, for example, don't use the platform frequently.
Conte believes Musk will maximize the number of people who want to use Twitter
""One thing we know about Musk is that he's truly an innovator and he'll push the boundaries. He didn't put all the money into it to lose the money,"" said Conte. ""He put the money into it because he thinks he can make more money, right? I think that's the thing to look forward to.""CREDIT: by PAUL GUGGENHEIMER"
154,28-Apr-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Musk Understands That Twitter Is Built to Gamify Conversation: [Op-Ed],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2655977778/BFD812D457A14912PQ/271?accountid=13946,"Can Elon Musk break Twitter? I hope so.I'm not accusing Musk of being a sleeper agent. The man loves Twitter. He tweets as if he had been raised by the blue bird and the fail whale. Three days before locking in his purchase of the platform, Musk blasted out an unflattering photograph of Bill Gates and, next to it, an illustration of a pregnant man. ""In case u need to lose a boner fast,"" Musk, Time's 2021 person of the year, told his more than 80 million followers. He believed Gates was shorting Tesla's stock, and this was his response. It got over 165,000 retweets and 1.3 million likes. That's a man who understands what Twitter truly is.Jack Dorsey, a Twitter co-founder and former chief executive, always wanted it to be something else. Something it wasn't, and couldn't be. ""The purpose of Twitter is to serve the public conversation,"" he said in 2018. Twitter began ""measuring conversational health"" and trying to tweak the platform to burnish it. Sincere as the effort was, it was like those liquor ads advising moderation. You don't get people to drink less by selling them whiskey. Similarly, if your intention was to foster healthy conversation, you'd never limit thoughts to 280 characters or add like and retweet buttons or quote-tweet features. Twitter can't be a place to hold healthy conversation because that's not what it's built to do.So what is Twitter built to do? It's built to gamify conversation. As C. Thi Nguyen, a philosopher at the University of Utah, has written, it does that ""by offering immediate, vivid and quantified evaluations of one's conversational success. Twitter offers us points for discourse; it scores our communication. And these gamelike features are responsible for much of Twitter's psychological wallop. Twitter is addictive, in part, because it feels so good to watch those numbers go up and up.""Nguyen's core argument is that games are pleasurable in part because they simplify the complexity of life. They render the rules clear, the score visible. That's fine when we want to play a game. But sometimes we end up in games or gamelike systems in which we don't want to trade our values for those of the designers and don't even realize we're doing it. The danger, then, is what Nguyen calls ""value capture."" That, he writes, comes when:1. Our natural values are rich, subtle and hard to express.2. We are placed in a social or institutional setting which presents simplified, typically quantified, versions of our values back to ourselves.3. The simplified versions take over in our motivation and deliberation.Twitter takes the rich, numerous and subtle values that we bring to communication and quantifies our success through follower counts, likes and retweets. Slowly, what Twitter rewards becomes what we do. If we don't, then no matter -- no one sees what we're saying anyway. We become what the game wants us to be, or we lose. And that's what's happening to some of the most important people and industries and conversations on the planet right now.Many of Twitter's power users are political, media, entertainment and technology elites. They -- we! -- are particularly susceptible to a gamified discourse on the topics we obsess over. It's hard to make political change. It's hard to create great journalism. It's hard to fill the ever-yawning need for validation. It's hard to dent the arc of technological progress. Twitter offers the instant, constant simulation of doing exactly that. The feedback is immediate. The opportunities are infinite. Forget Max Weber's ""strong and slow boring of hard boards."" Twitter is a power drill, or at least it feels like one.At about this point, the answer probably seems obvious: Log off! One can, and many do. But it comes at a cost. To log off is to miss much that matters, in industries where knowing what matters is essential. It's become clichéd to say Twitter is not real life, and that's true enough. But it shapes real life by shaping the perceptions of those exposed to it. It shapes real life by shaping what the media covers. (It's not for nothing that The New York Times is now urging reporters to unplug from Twitter and re-engage with the world outside their screens.) It shapes real life by giving the politicians and business titans who master it control of the attentional agenda. Attention is currency, and Twitter is the most important market for attention that there is.There is a reason that Donald Trump, with his preternatural gift for making people look at him, was Twitter's most natural and successful user. And he shows how the platform can shape the lives of those who never use it. From 2017 to 2021, the White House was occupied by what was, in effect, a Twitter account with a cardiovascular system, and the whole world bore the consequences.I am not a reflexive Musk critic. He has done remarkable things. He turned the electric car market from a backwater catering to hippies to the unquestioned future of the automobile industry, and he did so in the only sustainable way: He made electric cars awesome. He reinvigorated American interest in space and did so in the only sustainable way: by making rockets more awesome and affordable. He's made huge investments in solar energy and battery innovation and at least tried to think creatively about mass transit, with investments in hyperloop and tunnel-drilling technology. He co-founded OpenAI, the most public-spirited of the big artificial intelligence shops.Much of this has been built on the back of public subsidies, government contracts, loan guarantees and tax credits, but I don't take that as a mark against him: He's the best argument in the modern era that the government and the private sector can do together what neither can achieve apart. If anything, I fear that Twitter will distract Musk from more important work.Nor am I surprised that a résumé like Musk's coexists with a tendency toward manias, obsessions, grudges, union-busting and vindictiveness. Extreme personalities are rarely on the edge of the bell curve only because of benevolence. But Twitter unleashes his worst instincts and rewards him, with attention and fandom and money -- so much money -- for indulging them. That Musk has so capably bent Twitter to his own purposes doesn't absolve him of his behavior there, any more than it absolved Trump. A platform that heaps rewards on those who behave cruelly, or even just recklessly, is a dangerous thing.But far too often, that's what Twitter does. Twitter rewards decent people for acting indecently. The mechanism by which this happens is no mystery. Engagement follows slashing ripostes and bold statements and vicious dunks. ""I'm frustrated that Bill Gates would bet against Tesla, a company aligned with his values,"" is a lame tweet. ""Bill Gates = boner killer"" is a viral hit. The easiest way to rack up points is to worsen the discourse.Twitter has survived, and thrived, because it has never been just what I have described here. Much of what can be found there is funny and smart and sweet. So many on the platform want it to be a better place than it is and try to make it so. For a long time, they were joined in that pursuit by Twitter's executive class, who wanted the same. They liked Twitter, but not too much. They believed in it, but they were also a little appalled by it. That fundamental tension -- between what Twitter was and what so many believed it could be -- held it in balance. No longer.Musk's stated agenda for Twitter is confusing mostly for its modesty. He's proposed an edit button, an open-source algorithm, cracking down on bots and doing ... something ... to secure free speech. I tend to agree with the technology writer Max Read, who predicts that Musk ""will strive to keep Twitter the same level of bad, and in the same kinds of ways, as it always has been, because, to Musk, Twitter is not actually bad at all.""Musk reveals what he wants Twitter to be by how he acts on it. You shall know him by his tweets. He wants it to be what it is, or even more anarchic than that. Where I perhaps disagree with Read is that I think it will be more of a cultural change for Twitter than anyone realizes to have the master of the service acting on it as Musk does, to have the platform's owner embracing and embodying its excesses in a way no previous leader has done.What will Twitter feel like to liberals when Musk is mocking Senator Elizabeth Warren on the platform he owns and controls as ""Senator Karen""? Will they want to enrich him by contributing free labor to his company? Conservatives are now celebrating Musk's purchase of the platform, but what if, faced with a deepening crisis of election disinformation, he goes into goblin mode against right-wing politicians who are making his hands-off moderation hopes untenable or who are threatening his climate change agenda?What will it be like to work at Twitter when the boss is using his account to go to war with the Securities and Exchange Commission or fight a tax bill he dislikes? Unless Musk changes his behavior radically, and implausibly, I suspect his ownership will heighten Twitter's contradictions to an unbearable level. What would follow isn't the collapse of the platform but the right-sizing of its influence.Or maybe not. Betting against Musk has made fools of many in recent years. But I count myself, still, as a cautious believer in Musk's power to do the impossible -- in this case, to expose what Twitter is and to right-size its influence. In fact, I think he's the only one with the power to do it. Musk is already Twitter's ultimate player. Now he's buying the arcade. Everything people love or hate about it will become his fault. Everything he does that people love or hate will be held against the platform. He will be Twitter. He will have won the game. And nothing loses its luster quite like a game that has been beaten.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

155,28-Apr-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Making Twitter Worse Makes No Business Sense: [Op-Ed],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2655977773/BFD812D457A14912PQ/286?accountid=13946,"The Tesla co-founder and chief executive Elon Musk is set to shortly become the new owner of a slightly used social media platform with more than 217 million daily users. He has said very little about how he plans to make the business work, but one thing is clear: He is really, really preoccupied with how we talk on the platform and appears intent on rolling back some of its moderation policies in order to allow all legal speech on Twitter.""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,"" Mr. Musk said in his announcement of the deal. He professes to have a healthy tolerance of criticism. ""I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,"" he tweeted.But the statements of free speech absolutists like Mr. Musk conflates harassment with criticism. I've been on the receiving end of both in my two decades of writing columns about media, finance, culture and politics -- and there is a material difference between the two.To wit: A couple of weeks ago, a former colleague of Mr. Musk's at PayPal, Keith Rabois, called me dumb on Twitter after I suggested that eliminating moderation policies would be bad for Twitter's business. This is not a particularly sophisticated criticism, but neither is it harassment.However, I've also received rape threats, anonymous letters to my home address, threatening comments about my family and all manner of misogynistic pejoratives that are not printable in this newspaper for my stated positions on everything from abortion to hiring practices at start-ups to who the next James Bond should be. I don't even have to write anything particularly provocative for this to happen; I once got a violent threat for a column I wrote about why I disagree with the way the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the Consumer Price Index.These are not uncommon experiences for women and minorities who speak in public, on Twitter and beyond, and I've suffered far less harassment than others. It happens all the time. Twitter's current moderation policies can't completely prevent it, but they are designed to mitigate it. Twitter requires its users to comply with a terms of service agreement that bans certain types of speech -- harassment, in particular. It also has moderation policies in place to combat disinformation. The value of these measures isn't always apparent to powerful people such as Mr. Musk because if you're a white man on the internet, you're far less likely to get a rape threat, and you're also heavily insulated from the possibility of real-world violence.Mr. Musk insists that the company's policies are too restrictive. But this is not about free speech in the sense that the First Amendment is -- ensuring that the state can't censor its citizens. What Mr. Musk seems to seek is a kind of infinite license to say almost anything, anywhere. It's an absolutist definition of free speech that says corporations are obligated to let things that may be harmful to their users or bad for their businesses remain on their platforms because any limitation on speech is de facto censorship and censorship of any kind is worse than the consequences of hate speech, harassment and disinformation.Of course, getting rid of policies that restrict hate speech will most likely affect women and minorities much more than it does white men like Mr. Musk, and unlike him, most people on the receiving end of threats and harassment can't afford personal security. Twitter's rules already allow for a broad range of abuse, much of which falls into a kind of gray area between personal insult and harassment.What exactly does he believe can't be said on the platform right now? It certainly doesn't take long to find discredited race science, arguments that women are intellectually inferior, antisemitism, defenses of white supremacism and transphobic comments that remain on the platform even under current policy. It is easy to assume that the banned speech that Mr. Musk is standing up for is worse even than that. As the comedian Michael Che put it on ""Saturday Night Live,"" the $44 billion deal shows ""how badly white guys want to use the N-word.""All of this is a moral and ethical case for keeping moderation policies in place, but what's more baffling about Mr. Musk's crusade is it's hard to see how eliminating them would be good for the business. Right now, Twitter's demographics skew male. If Twitter wants to further scale up its business and increase profitability, which is ostensibly its goal, it needs to expand its reach. Making the platform a hostile environment for women and minorities isn't conducive to expansion, unless you believe your most valuable audience is white men who skew conservative and that they exist in ever larger numbers -- and demographic trends indicate that they do not.If anything, Twitter's history indicates that when you make the platform more hospitable to a range of people, the user base grows. When the biggest Twitter troll of all, former President Donald Trump, was removed from the platform in January of 2021, research suggested that the percentage of adults on social media who said they used Twitter increased by 21 percent. (Mr. Trump has said that he has no plans to rejoin Twitter, but this column is not long enough to catalog all of the things he has said he would not do that he later did anyway, so some skepticism is in order.) If the former president is invited back, it's entirely plausible that some of the newer post-Trump users would leave.Mr. Musk has said he is not buying Twitter to make money, but as a successful entrepreneur, he presumably wants to make the company, which has long struggled with profitability, a success. The company's revenue is currently very advertising-dependent, and in my experience as a former media entrepreneur and newspaper editor in chief, advertisers generally don't like to promote their brands alongside provocative content; even everyday political news is sometimes too much. If Mr. Musk allows Twitter to become a cesspool of hate speech and disinformation, he'll test the risk averseness of the platform's advertisers, and it's likely that he'll find himself with fewer brands that are willing to take the risk of appearing in people's polluted feeds.There's also, of course, the risk -- both moral and to the business -- that allowing more harassment and disinformation on the platform will result in real-world physical harm. The 2016 Pizzagate conspiracy theory, a precursor to QAnon, spread largely over social media and resulted in a man firing an AR-15 rifle in a Washington, D.C., pizza parlor. When people feel entitled to harm others because hateful speech is normalized online, it increases the ease with which conspiracy theories metastasize into acts of violence. A platform that spreads that kind of speech and takes a laissez-faire approach to disinformation doesn't just create an unpleasant experience for users; it can get someone killed.It's entirely possible that Mr. Musk hasn't thought about these things very thoroughly. His public bid for Twitter began only a few weeks ago, and since then his stated intentions have changed repeatedly, accompanied by a late and misleading securities filing and contradictory statements. He enjoys online trolling, and this may have started as a joke, which was then taken so seriously by the market, Twitter shareholders and the public that Mr. Musk himself began to consider it.If that's what happened, he may be the dog that caught the car. Tesla stock fell in the wake of the purchase announcement, potentially a reflection of shareholder sentiment that Mr. Musk may not be able to effectively run yet another company in addition to the four (Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and the Boring Company) he already leads.Sophisticated moderation policies are difficult to develop and enforce, and Twitter has already spent years tinkering and trying to come up with something that works. The current terms of service are not perfect, but if Mr. Musk chooses to partly or fully dismantle them, he may experience Twitter in a new way himself: The aspects of the platform that are weaponized against women and minorities may not be so friendly to him, either. And if the company can't expand its user base, his worst critics may be the only growth area of Twitter.Elizabeth Spiers (@espiers) is a writer and digital media strategist.

156,28-Apr-22,Barron's (Online),Why User Numbers Are Key for Tech This Earnings Season,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2656140422/BFD812D457A14912PQ/396?accountid=13946,"Anyone wondering why shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms are rallying can be forgiven for their confusion.
Meta gained more than 17% after reporting lower-than-expected revenue in the first quarter and providing disappointing guidance for the period ending in June. Amazon and Apple earnings, due out today after the bell, are both expected to see profits slip as well.
For Meta, investors latched on to the rise in user numbers . Daily active users climbed to 1.96 billion, beating analyst estimates after a decline in the previous quarter.
That equates to a quarter of the world's population looking at data on Facebook servers. Why get excited about a relatively small increase?
Expectations for Facebook were at rock bottom. Part of the rally was relief that things aren't worse.
And it points to the bigger issue—that link between users, subscriptions, and advertising. If Facebook can add users even at its enormous scale, it bodes well for growth. Amazon and Apple also sell subscription services and those will be a key element to watch in their results, especially after Netflix shares collapsed when it predicted a loss of subscribers.
And somewhere in that link is the answer to what Tesla CEO Elon Musk plans to do with Twitter. If he has a secret plan to better monetize its huge user base, it makes a lot more sense that he is buying at such a premium .

Meta Platforms' Q2 Revenue Outlook Falls Short
Facebook parent Meta Platforms' shares jumped 18% late Wednesday after the company reported a gain in daily active users, but it didn't quite meet Wall Street's expectations on revenue and its second-quarter outlook doesn't meet current forecasts, either.
* Revenue of $27.9 billion fell short of the $28.3 billion consensus forecast. Meta expects second-quarter revenue of $28 billion to $30 billion, below the $30.7 billion analysts forecast. The initial stock gain likely reflects relief that the Q1 results weren't worse than the company's forecast range.
* Facebook's ability to target ads has been hampered under Apple's stricter policies against tracking consumers on iPhones, and it faces growing competition from other social-media sites such as TikTok. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, given current growth levels, the company is planning to slow some of its investments.
* Zuckerberg said Meta will use artificial intelligence to recommend content to users from the entire site, not just what friends and family post. That is similar to TikTok's For You feed, which suggests content based on users' interests, not just whom they follow, The Wall Street Journal reported.
* Meta said it had 2.87 billion daily active people on its services in the quarter, up 6% from a year ago, including 1.96 billion active daily Facebook users in the U.S. and Canada, up 4%.
What's Next: Zuckerberg said Meta expects to be ""meaningfully better than others"" at making money on services in the Metaverse, but he also said that a return on investments is years away. He said the company is ""laying the groundwork for a very exciting 2030.""

What the Twitter Deal Means for Bitcoin and Dogecoin
Elon Musk's $44 billion deal to buy Twitter could have significant implications for digital assets. The crypto community—which is active on Twitter—has been rife with speculation over how the social-media group could change and support digital assets under the leadership of Musk, an outspoken proponent of cryptocurrencies.
* One significant move Musk could make is pushing Twitter to buy Bitcoin as a treasury asset, similar to what he has done at Tesla and SpaceX.
* Tesla revealed last year that it bought Bitcoin, and $1.3 billion in digital assets remained on the electric-vehicle maker's books as of the end of March. Musk's aerospace company, SpaceX, also owns Bitcoin.
* Dogecoin, the crypto most associated with Musk, who has played a key role in its rise, rallied more than 30% following news of the Twitter deal. In early 2022 Tesla began accepting dogecoin for merchandise purchases on its website. Dogecoin holders may be hoping Musk's Twitter could see more of the same.
What's Next: The crypto community is keenly watching how a reimagined Twitter could play a role in wider efforts for decentralization, and whether Musk leading Twitter will lead to wider adoption of Bitcoin and other digital assets.

Boeing Struggles With Production Delays, Supply Chains, Inflation
Boeing continues to struggle with production delays, now pushing back the introduction of its 777X passenger jet to 2025, as it faces supply-chain constraints and inflation. It reported a larger-than-expected loss of $1.2 billion for the first quarter.
* Boeing's shares tumbled to a new 52-week low before closing down 7.5% on Wednesday. CEO Dave Calhoun told CNBC it was ""a messier quarter than any of us would've liked."" The quarter included the March 21 crash of a China Eastern 737-800 flight, killing 132.
* Boeing delivered 95 commercial jets in the first quarter, up from 77 jets a year ago, but less than half of the 218 jets delivered in the first quarter of 2018, before the Covid-19 pandemic or issues with the 737 Max.
* Boeing disclosed it lost $1.1 billion from a deal then-CEO Dennis Muilenburg negotiated with former President Donald Trump to modify two 747 jumbo jets into Air Force One jets. Boeing also took $212 million in pretax charges related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
* Calhoun told analysts regulators were taking longer to certify Boeing planes and are more thorough than they used to be. Some of its defense contracts continued to have cost overruns and generated more losses. Deliveries of the 737 MAX are running behind plan, The Wall Street Journal reported.
What's Next: Boeing is increasing production of the 737 Max this quarter to 31 planes a month. It is also focused on the production of the 787, Calhoun told analysts, along with return to service of aircraft built and stored for airline customers.

Archegos Fraud Case Highlights Weakness in Financial Oversight
The federal fraud case against Archegos Capital's Bill Hwang and CFO Patrick Halligan, who were arrested on Wednesday, highlighted weaknesses in the oversight of the financial system and the potential hazards of large derivative transactions.
* The fund's collapse in March 2021 left banks with more than $10 billion in losses and prompted calls for more regulatory oversight. Prosecutors in New York say Hwang, Halligan, and co-conspirators lied to get billions of dollars in bank loans, which they used to inflate the price of stocks.
* Hwang's lawyer told The Wall Street Journal his client is ""entirely innocent,"" and the lawyer for Halligan said her client is ""innocent and will be exonerated."" Two other individuals from the firm pleaded guilty and are cooperating with prosecutors.
* The government said the plan used synthetic stock swaps that allowed the fund to hide concentrated bets in shares of ViacomCBS, Baidu, and Tencent Music Entertainment Group. The swaps required the banks, including Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley, to buy the stocks, ultimately pushing their prices up.
* Archegos secretly controlled more than half the shares of certain companies in 2021, including ViacomCBS, prosecutors said. It also made up more than 35% of the daily trading volume in several stocks.
What's Next: Archegos was a so-called family office set up to manage Hwang's money. The collapse also highlights this lightly regulated corner of the investment world, where managers have fewer restrictions because they don't use outside investor money.

PayPal Trims 2022 Outlook After 'Strong' First-Quarter Start
PayPal Holdings said its first quarter was a ""solid start,"" but cut its outlook for the full year, bracing for payments volumes to weaken. It is forecasting adjusted profit per share of between $3.81 and $3.93, down from a prior forecast of $4.60 to $4.75 a share.
* Net revenue for 2022 is projected to rise 11% to 13%, down from an earlier forecast of 15% to 17%. Red-hot inflation is putting a damper on consumer spending as households are forced to pare down nonessential spending such as dining out, travel, and entertainment.
* PayPal added 2.4 million net new active accounts in the first quarter, for a total of 429 million active accounts, and expects to add 10 million new active accounts in 2022. Payment volume rose 13%, to $323 billion, over last year, about even with the consensus on FactSet.
* Visa stock jumped 6.4% Wednesday after the credit-card company reported better-than-expected second-quarter profit and sales, fueled by the recovery of international travel and a 38% increase in cross-border transactions. ""We continue to view Visa as an easy name to own,"" Jefferies analyst Trevor Williams wrote.
* Despite high inflation, supply-chain disruptions, rising interest rates, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, ""there is no evident impact on our global payments volumes,"" CFO Vasant Prabhu told analysts. He said he expects ""plenty of recovery to come"" in travel spending.
What's Next: PayPal, based in San Jose, Calif., will close its San Francisco office on June 3, but said it is committed to hiring and investing in California and the Bay Area. A spokesperson told Barron's that the pandemic taught PayPal there are many ways to work effectively and provide flexibility.

I had to sell my home after less than two years. Can I still qualify for the gain exclusion break?
Many residential real estate markets are still red hot. Significant home-sale gains are likely even if you've only owned your place for a relatively short time, and now have to sell.
If you've owned for at least two years, you probably qualify for the lucrative federal income tax principal residence gain exclusion break. Under that deal, unmarried individuals can exclude (pay no federal capital-gains tax on) home-sale gains of up to $250,000. Married joint-filing couples can exclude up to $500,000.
But what if you've owned your place for less than the required two years? Can you still qualify for a gain exclusion? Answer: You might qualify for a reduced exclusion that would be much better than no exclusion at all.

 Why User Numbers Are Key for Tech This Earnings Season

157,28-Apr-22,USA Today (Online),"Why does billionaire Elon Musk want to take Twitter private, and what does it mean for shareholders?",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2656101090/BFD812D457A14912PQ/427?accountid=13946,"Billionaire Elon Musk plans to make Twitter a private company following his $44 billion deal to buy the social media platform. Twitter has been a publicly traded company since 2013, but it only has turned a profit twice -- in 2018 and 2019.  The social media platform's more than 200 million user base is much smaller than competitors like TikTok and Facebook, and it's had lackluster revenue growth in comparison to Google and Facebook, the two dominant forces in digital advertising. However, Twitter has been a popular social media platform for politicians, such as former President Donald Trump before he was banned from the site in January 2021, celebrities, and others to get their messages out for free to their followers. Musk has argued that in order for Twitter to be successful and serve the ""social imperative"" of free speech, it must be ""transformed as a private company."" What does Twitter going private mean for shareholders'?  If Musk's planned deal to buy Twitter goes through, and he takes the company private, Twitter shareholders will receive $54.20 per share in cash. That's a 38% premium to Twitter's closing stock price on April 1, the last trading day before Musk publicly announced he had taken a 9% stake in the company. That will put extra money in the pockets of most shareholders, said Matthew Faulkner, an assistant professor of finance at San Jose State University.  There’s only been a few times in history when Twitter stock jumped above $54.20 – once in 2013 after its Initial Public Offering, and in February 2021 in what Faulkner called a “COVID run-up of the market.”  In order to go private, Twitter's board will negotiate a takeover deal with Musk and then host a special election for its investors to accept or decline the purchase. Any investor who owns voting stock in the company would be able to vote, although institutional shareholders who tend to hold larger amounts of stock would represent a consequently larger portion of the vote.  It's easier to make changes in a private company The biggest, and most obvious, benefit of making the company private is allowing more flexibility to make big changes when a company is not under scrutiny of thousands of shareholders and public filings required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, financial experts say. Musk, however, still would be held accountable by his financiers, but going private may allow him to add value to the company, Faulkner said.  ""Acting in the best interests of the shareholders is the goal of the board and management,"" Faulkner said. ""And that's a very important thing to think about with the decision that they made here."" When Musk announced plans to take Tesla private in 2018, he said doing so would allow the electric car company to operate ""free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible."" Wild stock swings and the quarterly earnings cycle both distracted workers and put pressure on the company to make decisions that were right for the moment, but not in the long-term, Musk wrote.  Musk, the richest person in the world with an estimated fortune of $219 billion according to Forbes Magazine, has hinted at adding an edit button to tweets, ending Twitter’s dependence on ads, and expanding freedom of speech.  “There’s fewer hurdles to jump over to make big changes, or small changes, within the company when you're not having to answer to thousands of shareholders,” Faulkner said.  Musk has said he would ""endeavor to keep as many shareholders in privatized Twitter as allowed by law."" Going private means no SEC reports Taking Twitter private also means the company would no longer need to report its financial documents or ""material"" developments to the SEC, the federal regulatory agency Musk has had legal troubles with in the past. Those regularly filed reports, which can include risks to the company and any plans that could impact its financial performance, are public information that shareholders and anyone can view. After Musk tweeted that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private, the SEC in 2018 accused him of securities fraud in a civil lawsuit that charged him with lying or being recklessly misleading in his tweets. Tesla shares dropped massively following the SEC’s claim, and Musk eventually had to pay a fine and step down as chairman of Tesla.  Other public companies that have gone private Other big, well-known publicly traded companies also have gone private – and then jumped back into the market. Dell said going private in 2013 would allow the company to ""be even more flexible and entrepreneurial."" Its founder, Michael Dell, said taking his company private allowed it to weather the downturn in the PC industry and expand into other growing IT sectors. ""One of the beauties of being the controlling shareholder in a company is you can do whatever you want to do,"" Dell said. After going private in 2013, with its stock closing at $13.73, Dell went public again in 2018 at a price of $46 per share. The company said returning to the stock market would simplify its capital and ownership structure. Hilton was bought out by a private investor group in 2007, and went public again in 2013. During its stint as a private company, the hotel business rebuilt itself: its number of open rooms increased by 36%, and the number of room in the pipeline – to be developed but not being built yet – went up by 60%. In Phoenix, Swift Transportation, one of the largest truck carriers in the United States, first went public in 1990. Company founder Jerry Moyes took the business private in 2007, after he had been forced out as CEO two years earlier following a SEC investigation for insider trading. Moyes admitted no wrongdoing and paid a $1.26 million settlement. The company went public again in 2010, and it merged in 2017 to become Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings.

158,28-Apr-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Stocks Gain as Earnings Roll In,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2656004700/BFD812D457A14912PQ/535?accountid=13946,"Stocks edged higher in choppy trading Wednesday, clawing back some of their losses after selling off sharply a day earlier.
It was a day of fluctuations, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting session highs in the early afternoon before paring their gains into the close. The Dow industrials ranged about 588 points between their high and low of the day.
The S&P 500 gained 8.76 points, or 0.2%, to 4183.96. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 61.75 points, or 0.2%, to 33301.93. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.81 points, or less than 0.1%, to 12488.93.
Many big companies are reporting earnings this week. Shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose about 20% in after-hours trading after the company beat earnings expectations. Twitter, which this week agreed to sell itself for $44 billion to Elon Musk, is set to report Thursday.
Investors said they saw the moves higher as a temporary relief rally after Tuesday's selloff, when the Nasdaq recorded its largest one-day percentage decline since September 2020 and the Dow dropped more than 800 points. Analysts and money managers have been digesting earnings reports and weighing concerns about inflation, the prospect of rapid policy tightening by the Federal Reserve and the spread of Covid-19 in China.
""Stocks have been so weak so far this month I believe investors are seeing some value in the current pricing,"" said Tracie McMillion, head of global asset-allocation strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
Major U.S. stock indexes remain down substantially for the year, with the S&P 500 down 12% and Nasdaq Composite down 20%. On Tuesday, the Nasdaq closed at its lowest level since December 2020, wiping out the gains it notched in 2021.
The market is in the thick of corporate earnings season. Analysts expect that profits from companies in the S&P 500 grew by 7.5% in the first quarter from a year earlier, according to FactSet.
Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, sees the next moves in the stock market as either sideways or down.
Earnings are ""supporting the market to some extent, but I don't think it's enough to support it higher,"" Ms. Shah said. She said her team has moved to a neutral recommendation on their overall equity positions. ""The risks are just piling up,"" she said. ""We don't want to be picking up pennies in front of the steamroller.""
About 80% of S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings so far have surpassed analysts' estimates, FactSet data show. Still, Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management, said investors have concerns on a range of issues. ""Markets are mostly focused on some of the macro concerns around aggressive tighter Fed policy, as well as this global growth scare that's playing out,"" she said.
Many of those concerns have driven the dollar to its highest level in more than two years. The dollar tends to strengthen when the global economy sours and when investors expect U.S. growth to outpace that of the rest of the world. Rising interest rates in the U.S. also typically benefit the greenback as higher rates attract yield-seeking investors to the currency.
The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against a basket of others, rose 0.5% to 95.19, its highest closing value since March 2020. It has risen in 18 of the past 20 trading days.
In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 2.817% from 2.773% on Tuesday. Recently, investors have sold bonds in anticipation of higher interest rates, and the yield on the benchmark note remains close to its highest level since 2018. Bond yields and prices move inversely.
Natural-gas prices in Europe rose 4.1% after Russia said it would halt gas flows to Poland and Bulgaria over their refusal to pay on Moscow's new terms. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose 0.3% to $105.32 a barrel.
Among individual stocks, Tesla shares added $5.09, or 0.6%, to $881.51, recouping some of their losses after tumbling 12% Tuesday, their biggest one-day drop in more than a year. Twitter fell $1.04, or 2.1%, to $48.64, about 10% below the $54.20 per-share-price that Elon Musk and Twitter agreed to in their deal to take the company private.
Boeing shares lost $12.58, or 7.5%, to $154.46. The company posted a $1.24 billion quarterly loss and again pushed back the expected first delivery of its new 777X twin-aisle jet.
Microsoft jumped $13, or 4.8%, to $283.22 after the company on Tuesday reported higher revenue and profit last quarter as demand for its cloud services and software continued to climb. Shares of Google parent Alphabet fell $87.11, or 3.7%, to $2285.89 after the technology behemoth posted slower sales growth amid disruptions in digital advertising spending.
Chipotle Mexican Grill added $37.42, or 2.6%, to $1,475.63 after the burrito chain said total revenue increased 16% last quarter amid higher food, beverage and packaging costs, which the company said was partially offset by menu-price increases.
Lucid Group gained 43 cents, or 2.4%, to $18.07 after the company late Tuesday said Saudi Arabia had agreed to purchase as many as 100,000 vehicles over a 10-year period.
Robinhood Markets fell 49 cents, or 4.9%, to $9.51 after the online brokerage said it was laying off 9% of its full-time employees.
European stocks rose, with the Stoxx Europe 600 closing up 0.7%.
Early Thursday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 0.6%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.8% and the China CSI 300 index of stocks traded in Shanghai and Shenzen was up 0.8%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.8%.

159,28-Apr-22,Washington Examiner,What Musk’s purchase of Twitter will mean for the company and users,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2656640809/BFD812D457A14912PQ/656?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk’s $44 billion Twitter purchase will not only mean big changes in the way the social media giant conducts business, but it will also affect users of the platform.
Musk’s stated intention for buying the company is to realign its mission. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO sees free speech as the immutable foundation upon which democracy rests and has been critical of how the social media giant has handled speech on its platform in the past.
“Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,” said Musk after the news broke that Twitter’s board had agreed to his offer to buy the company at $54.20 per share — a major premium over where the stock was just a month ago.
Many of the changes will invariably focus on topics surrounding free speech and transparency, but the business model and the company itself will also experience an upheaval, given that Musk intends to take the company private. The process on the business side will entail a bevy of lawyers and mountains of paperwork. Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal has said it would likely take between three and six months for the deal to come to a close.
Darrick Mix, partner and head of the capital markets practice at Duane Morris, told the Washington Examiner that the agreement between Musk and the board appears to be a pretty standard and straightforward merger agreement.
The next step in the process is a shareholder meeting in which Twitter's shareholders will get the opportunity to vote on whether to approve the sale. Federal regulators will also examine the proposed purchase, although they aren’t expected to try to block the transaction.
Mix said that for Twitter and Musk, it might be smooth sailing in terms of completing the deal, although there are a few potential obstacles that could be encountered. “As is standard in this type of merger agreement, there are possible ways for the Twitter board to terminate the deal with Elon Musk if they get a superior proposal from another potential buyer,” he said.
Musk will also be slapped with a $1 billion termination fee if he isn’t able to secure financing for the multibillion-dollar deal or if the plan to take Twitter private ends up falling through.
The fact that Musk wants to take the company private is telling about the coming course shift that is in store for Twitter.
By taking Twitter private, the primary advantage for Musk is that he will essentially have unilateral control over the business and how it operates. He has very precise views about the social media platform and its value to society and will use the power of controlling the company to make policy changes to reflect those beliefs.
Additionally, everything in Twitter’s filings will no longer be public, and Musk won’t have to file the same documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission or discuss things such as executive compensation and corporate strategy.
Mark Weinstein is the founder of social media service MeWe and an expert in privacy and free speech. Weinstein said he foresees Musk as retooling Twitter to have a “mission orientation,” meaning that instead of just operating the platform to make as much money as possible, Musk envisions a platform that operates under certain new standards.
One of the big changes will be with content moderation. Musk believes that Twitter currently has too heavy a hand in moderating who is tweeting and what people are tweeting about. While details about what the new platform’s speech policies will look like are likely months away, Musk has hinted at his vision for how users on the platform will be able to interact.
A big part of the updated user experience will likely come in the form of increased transparency, including about who is behind certain accounts. “I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spambots, and authenticating all humans,” Musk said.
Identity verification can be done in a number of ways, although given the millions of Twitter accounts that are out there, it will likely result in a massive user purge from the platform, according to Weinstein.
“Whatever your opinion is, it’s going to connect to you,” Weinstein told the Washington Examiner. “And this is very interesting because, in a certain way, it’s an invasion of privacy. On the other hand, it’s a way to guarantee that what people say is connected to who they really are so they can’t just propagate any kind of falsehood and be anonymous so nobody can really do a fact check even on the person.”
And while Twitter will likely hemorrhage millions of users as a result of Musk’s identity verification push, Weinstein said he also expects other users who have had their accounts suspended by the platform to be reinstated.
Twitter could also see a splash of users who might have sworn off the social media platform in favor of competitors such as GETTR, Parler, and Truth Social to rejoin Twitter because Musk has vowed to prioritize free speech. Those platforms rose in popularity as a backlash to Twitter’s current policies.
Additionally, there may be a big shake-up of Twitter’s executive board following the purchase. Weinstein expects there will be a shift away from technocratic executives in favor of a more mission-focused team.
In terms of a revenue model, Weinstein said there would likely be a retreat from so-called “surveillance capitalism,” which seeks to make a profit off customer data through means like targeted advertising.
There will probably be revenue loss from that shift, which could be made up through levers such as a subscription model, although Musk has pointed out that he doesn’t necessarily need Twitter to be a profitable enterprise because he is more focused on its mission rather than money.
“Twitter has experimented with a subscription model and failed at it, and that’s because there is no inspiration. Twitter can’t inspire its members to want to support,” Weinstein said.
With Musk at the helm and Twitter being reoriented to promote free speech, cut down on bots, and dampen propaganda, users might feel more inclined to support the company financially through some form of subscription that complements its free product.
All the coming changes are very much speculative. The changes will end up coming down to what Musk and his team think will best promote his vision of free speech and social discourse after the company is acquired.
“We just don’t have a good visibility into exactly how it will be governed after the transaction, but it appears he’ll control it and be able to shape it in accordance with his vision,” Mix said of Musk’s plans.

And he may use proceeds from a stock sale involving one of his other companies to do it. The billionaire sold 9.6 million shares of Tesla this week, valued at $8.5 billion, which would most likely go toward his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter. Twitter also announced Monday that Elon Musk was going to buy the social media company. Once the deal closes, which is expected this year, Twitter will become a privately held company. What happens next? Here's the latest on Musk's plan to buy Twitter. Apple reports strong earnings: Company warns of supply shortages and COVID shutdowns ahead Tech and privacy: Google will now let people remove phone numbers, addresses from search results How many Tesla shares did Musk sell? During a three-day period after the deal to acquire Twitter was announced, Musk sold 9.6 million shares valued at $8.5 billion, according to filings Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The trades were made at prices ranging from $822.68 to $999.13. In a tweet Thursday night, Musk said there are ""No further TSLA sales planned after today."" What changes might Musk make? Musk said he could cut executive and board pay to cut costs and find opportunities to monetize tweets, according to a Reuters report. Other changes to the service might include easing content moderation, which Musk has criticized, cutting back on ads, and introducing an edit button. What does the deal mean for Twitter shareholders? If the deal goes through, Twitter shareholders will get $54.20 a share in cash. As of midday Friday trading, Twitter shares are above $49. One of the big benefits for taking Twitter private is Musk can make changes more quickly without worrying about pleasing shareholders. Could Twitter shift to subscriptions? Experts believe a subscription model might be the best option for Twitter.  ""We think a subscription service will be key to a potential turnaround for Twitter,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Tuesday.

161,29-Apr-22,Los Angeles Times,BUSINESS; Is Musk already looking to bail on Twitter?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2656511271/BFD812D457A14912PQ/277?accountid=13946,"Is Elon Musk's spectacular $44-billion acquisition of Twitter about to fall victim to one of the greatest outbreaks of buyer's remorse of all time?
That's what some Musk observers are asking, based on the recent action in shares of Twitter and Tesla, the electric-car maker on which Musk's fortune is based, along with Musk's behavior in the immediate wake of his deal for the social media platform.
The economic argument against Musk's following through on his acquisition was laid out by Reuters in an article headlined ""Elon Musk probably won't buy Twitter."" The commentary piece concluded that Musk has financial reasons to let the deal fall apart.

Then there's the behavioral argument, which hinges on Musk's actions since the deal became public. He appears to have begun violating the terms of the formal purchase agreement within hours of its public release Tuesday.
The agreement allows Musk to issue tweets about the deal ""so long as such Tweets do not disparage the Company or any of its Representatives."" In at least three tweets since then, however, Musk has arguably disparaged the company and two of its executives, though the tweets did not directly reference the deal.
The agreement doesn't say what Twitter can do if Musk violates that provision. But it's not inconceivable that he's giving the Twitter board an excuse to send him packing.
Closing the deal, which is fashioned as a merger between Twitter and a new company owned entirely by Musk, would take several months. If the deal blows up, either Twitter or Musk would be on the hook for $1 billion in damages (depending on which side takes the blame). So it's worthwhile to examine the cost-benefit calculation for Musk if he chooses to walk away.
Let's begin by observing that Musk hasn't bought Twitter quite yet. He has lined up financial backing to buy the Twitter shares he doesn't already own -- about 91% of them, at $54.20 each. About half of the required $44 billion would come from Musk himself, including $21.5 billion in the form of margin loans against his Tesla shares.
Musk is commonly described as the world's richest man, with a net worth of some $240 billion, but that doesn't mean he has all that money lying around for him to do with as he wishes. Most of it is tied up in his 21% ownership of Tesla, but some of those shares have already been borrowed against and the company has imposed limits on how much more borrowing he can do against them.
He is also known to float proposals with little intention of carrying them out. His famous 2018 tweet proclaiming a plan to take Tesla private and claiming that funding was assured is a good example -- funding wasn't assured, and the proposal appeared to be mere vapor. (Musk and Tesla settled a government lawsuit over the tweet for $20 million each.)
In this case, the funding does appear to be assured and Musk's intentions far more advanced. But that doesn't mean that he can't back away from the deal at any point before its closing.
If Musk can't obtain the necessary loans, he might have to sell some of his Tesla stock -- which has fallen in value by some 24% since he initially disclosed a 9.2% stake in Twitter on April 4.
On Tuesday, the day after the sale agreement was reached, Tesla shares fell by nearly 13% to $873.28. They later recovered somewhat; TSLA ended down $4, or 0.45%, at $877.51; TWTR closed up 47 cents, or about 1%, at $49.11. Tesla peaked last November at about $1,230.
The recent action appears to represent real misgivings by Tesla shareholders about Musk's Twitter adventure. They could be unamused for several reasons. One is the extent to which he is financing the deal by borrowing against his Tesla holdings.
That makes Musk vulnerable to margin calls from his bank lenders, forcing him to sell shares if the stock continues to fall; Musk as a seller is not a good look for Tesla, since much of its value derives from his identification with the company.
The price at which Musk might have to start selling to shore up the collateral for the banks is unclear. Bloomberg places it at about $740. Another day like Tuesday, when Tesla fell by $121.60, would put Musk perilously close to that point.
Another issue for shareholders is that new distraction for Musk is the last thing they need, given their chief executive's notably short attention span.
That's especially true now, when Tesla is facing intensified competition in the electric-vehicle market from rivals at all price levels, from Ford and General Motors to BMW and other luxury brands. Tesla no longer can claim the EV market, particularly the luxury EV market, for itself.
Then there's the conflict that Twitter might generate for Musk -- that is, Tesla -- with the government of China.
To some extent, Beijing holds the future of Tesla in its hands, and it doesn't much care for Twitter. The platform is already banned in China, and anything that happens on Twitter outside Beijing's control -- but within what it thinks is Musk's control, might end up in retaliatory steps against the carmaker.
Shareholders might also be concerned that Tesla stock's day of reckoning is upon them. The company's market value of about $900 billion (at the current stock price) is roughly equivalent to those of the next 10 most valuable car companies combined, even though its vehicle output -- 930,000 in 2021 and 305,400 in the first quarter of this year -- amounts to only a bit more than 1% of global market share.
In other words, Tesla has been grossly overvalued for years by any traditional stock market metric. Companies can remain in that condition indefinitely, but more often than not, gravity has proved to be a harsh mistress to highfliers, and the trigger for a drastic revaluation can come from anywhere.
Just as Tesla shareholders have been displaying disquiet about the deal, Twitter shareholders have been displaying skepticism. Twitter stock has not converged decisively toward the $54.20 sale price since the announcement, nestled below $50 for much of the week.
That's a sizable gap from the offer price for a deal that doesn't face any significant pushback from antitrust regulators, or indeed any noticeable obstacles other than Musk's predilections and the solidity of the financing.
Musk has been explicit about some of what he would do with Twitter once he takes over. He says he would strengthen Twitter's role as platform for ""free speech,"" calling himself a ""free speech absolutist."" But he may not have a very clear understanding about how that principle is defined.
""By 'free speech', I simply mean that which matches the law,"" he tweeted Tuesday, for instance. ""I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law. If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.""
Except things are nowhere near that simple. Much of the discourse that has made Twitter resemble a toxic cesspool of hate speech, violence-mongering and disinformation isn't illegal in the United States, but noxious enough to undermine the platform's utility to millions of potential users. Twitter has suspended or permanently banned users who violate its established standards of civility -- even though their speech isn't illegal. Restoring those accounts might drive many users away.
Musk needs to learn that not everybody lives on his street. The European Union has taken a more aggressive stand against public hate speech than the U.S. EU officials already have warned Musk that their rules will have to govern Twitter in Europe.
""We are open but on our conditions,"" Thierry Breton, the EU's commissioner for the internal market, warned this week. ""At least we know what to tell him: 'Elon, there are rules. You are welcome but these are our rules. It's not your rules which will apply here.' ""
Musk himself has been a purveyor of damaging misinformation and disinformation on Twitter -- promoting the useless anti-COVID nostrum hydroxychloroquine as well as economically dubious cryptocurrencies, for example. Once he becomes Twitter's sole proprietor, its flaws will be his flaws; if he continues to use it to promote factitious narratives, he will be responsible for its debasement as a ""public square.""
The apparent success of his takeover bid has not seemed to get that message across to Musk. Start with his denigrating tweets about Twitter and its representatives.
On Tuesday, Musk replied to a tweet by conservative journalist Saagar Enjeti attacking Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde.
Gadde, the Twitter lawyer in charge of content moderation, was associated with Twitter's blocking of tweets about Hunter Biden's laptop computer and references to a New York Post article about the laptop. Musk called that blocking ""obviously incredibly inappropriate."" The exchange reportedly prompted a surge of tweeted attacks on Gadde.
Soon after that, Musk replied approvingly to an attack by right-wing conspiracy-monger Mike Cernovich on Twitter lawyer Jim Baker, whom he accused of having ""facilitated fraud."" Musk tweeted in reply, ""Sounds pretty bad...""
On Tuesday, Musk tweeted out a report that Truth Social, the Twitter-like service launched by former President Trump to offer a social media platform to conservatives like himself, was beating Twitter in Apple Store downloads. Musk added: ""Truth Social ... exists because Twitter censored free speech."" Your mileage may vary, but that sounds like disparagement to me.
Nor has Musk kept his Twitter logorrhea in check in other respects. On Wednesday, he joked, ""Next I'm buying Coca-Cola to put the cocaine back in."" All in fun, obviously (the last vestiges of cocaine came out of the soft drink in 1929), but Musk may have to decide whether he wants to play with Twitter as though it's just another device for him to get his infantile jollies, or set down real-world rules that would make it a more useful tool for public discourse, as he says he intends.
Which way will he go? At $44 billion, Twitter is an extremely expensive plaything. The service does not turn a profit, but it will have to do so to cover the debt that it will be saddled with by Musk -- an estimated $1 billion a year in debt service.
According to Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey, Musk's goal is to turn Twitter into a service that is ""maximally trusted and broadly inclusive."" It's not at all clear that those goals can be reconciled, or that Musk really wants to devote much of his free time or spend the money to reach that nirvana.
It's possible that a $1-billion breakup fee is his preferred out. But we may not know for months.

162,29-Apr-22,USA TODAY,On Musk aim to take Twitter private,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2656552820/BFD812D457A14912PQ/423?accountid=13946,"Billionaire Elon Musk plans to make Twitter a private company following his $44 billion deal to buy the social media platform.
Twitter has been a publicly traded company since 2013, but it only has turned a profit twice – in 2018 and 2019.
The social media platform's more than 200 million user base is much smaller than competitors like TikTok and Facebook, and it's had lackluster revenue growth in comparison to Google and Facebook, the two dominant forces in digital advertising.
However, Twitter has been a popular social media platform for politicians, such as former President Donald Trump before he was banned from the site in January 2021, celebrities, and others to get their messages out for free to their followers.
Musk has argued that in order for Twitter to be successful and serve the ""social imperative"" of free speech, it must be ""transformed as a private company.""
What does Twitter going private mean for shareholders'? 
If Musk's planned deal to buy Twitter goes through, and he takes the company private, Twitter shareholders will receive $54.20 per share in cash. That's a 38% premium to Twitter's closing stock price on April 1, the last trading day before Musk publicly announced he had taken a 9% stake in the company.
That will put extra money in the pockets of most shareholders, said Matthew Faulkner, an assistant professor of finance at San Jose State University. 
There's only been a few times in history when Twitter stock jumped above $54.20 – once in 2013 after its Initial Public Offering, and in February 2021 in what Faulkner called a ""COVID run-up of the market."" 
In order to go private, Twitter's board will negotiate a takeover deal with Musk and then host a special election for its investors to accept or decline the purchase.
Any investor who owns voting stock in the company would be able to vote, although institutional shareholders who tend to hold larger amounts of stock would represent a consequently larger portion of the vote. 
It's easier to make changes 
in a private company
The biggest, and most obvious, benefit of making the company private is allowing more flexibility to make big changes when a company is not under scrutiny of thousands of shareholders and public filings required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, financial experts say.
Musk, however, still would be held accountable by his financiers, but going private may allow him to add value to the company, Faulkner said. 
""Acting in the best interests of the shareholders is the goal of the board and management,"" Faulkner said. ""And that's a very important thing to think about with the decision that they made here.""
When Musk announced plans to take Tesla private in 2018, he said doing so would allow the electric car company to operate ""free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible.""
Wild stock swings and the quarterly earnings cycle both distracted workers and put pressure on the company to make decisions that were right for the moment, but not in the long-term, Musk wrote. 
Musk, the richest person in the world with an estimated fortune of $219 billion according to Forbes Magazine, has hinted at adding an edit button to tweets, ending Twitter's dependence on ads, and expanding freedom of speech.
""There's fewer hurdles to jump over to make big changes, or small changes, within the company when you're not having to answer to thousands of shareholders,"" Faulkner said. 
Musk has said he would ""endeavor to keep as many shareholders in privatized Twitter as allowed by law.""
Going private means 
not filing SEC reports
Taking Twitter private also means the company would no longer need to report its financial documents or ""material"" developments to the SEC, the federal regulatory agency Musk has had legal troubles with in the past.
Those regularly filed reports, which can include risks to the company and any plans that could impact its financial performance, are public information that shareholders and anyone can view.
After Musk tweeted that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private, the SEC in 2018 accused him of securities fraud in a civil lawsuit that charged him with lying or being recklessly misleading in his tweets.
Tesla shares dropped massively following the SEC's claim, and Musk eventually had to pay a fine and step down as chairman of Tesla. 
Other public companies 
that have gone private
Other big, well-known publicly traded companies also have gone private – and then jumped back into the market.
Dell said going private in 2013 would allow the company to ""be even more flexible and entrepreneurial."" Its founder, Michael Dell, said taking his company private allowed it to weather the downturn in the PC industry and expand into other growing IT sectors.
""One of the beauties of being the controlling shareholder in a company is you can do whatever you want to do,"" Dell said.
After going private in 2013, with its stock closing at $13.73, Dell went public again in 2018 at a price of $46 per share. The company said returning to the stock market would simplify its capital and ownership structure.
Hilton was bought out by a private investor group in 2007, and went public again in 2013. During its stint as a private company, the hotel business rebuilt itself: its number of open rooms increased by 36%, and the number of room in the pipeline – to be developed but not being built yet – went up by 60%.
In Phoenix, Swift Transportation, one of the largest truck carriers in the United States, first went public in 1990. Company founder Jerry Moyes took the business private in 2007, after he had been forced out as CEO two years earlier following a SEC investigation for insider trading. Moyes admitted no wrongdoing and paid a $1.26 million settlement.
The company went public again in 2010, and it merged in 2017 to become Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings.

163,29-Apr-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Twitter Isn't Rid of Wall Street --- Going private won't free the social-media company of the need to grow given its debt to banks,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2656541605/BFD812D457A14912PQ/439?accountid=13946,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Elon Musk is taking Twitter ""back from Wall Street"" in the words of its co-founder. The irony is the turbulent social network will be more indebted to the markets than ever.
Shortly after Twitter agreed to be acquired by the outspoken billionaire, its co-founder and two-time Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey was quick to thank Mr. Musk for getting his baby ""out of an impossible situation."" Twitter as a company supposedly dominated by Wall Street and an advertising model, Mr. Dorsey tweeted, ""has always been my sole issue and my biggest regret."" The now-enthusiastic bitcoin evangelist added in a series of tweets that Mr. Musk ""is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.""
That light will now need to show Mr. Musk the money -- specifically, how to make Twitter pay for itself. Twitter's average annual revenue growth lagged behind its peers over the past four years. And both the company and the world's richest person himself are incurring a substantial amount of debt from a group of lenders led by no less of a Wall Street institution than Morgan Stanley to fund the $44 billion deal. The takeover happens to be taking place during a global online advertising slump that is affecting peers such as Google, Facebook and Snapchat. On Thursday, Twitter said ad revenue rose 26% year over year to $1.1 billion in the first quarter. That was slightly below Wall Street's target, though the company reported the addition of about 14 million daily active users -- a big jump from the 5 million added in each of the past two quarters.
Mr. Musk has criticized Twitter's reliance on advertising, and spoken out in favor of new potential revenue streams such as subscriptions. But whichever direction he chooses to drive the company, even a privately held Twitter won't be free of the pressure to earn and boost profits.
The debt incurred from Mr. Musk's purchase will take the company's leverage to nearly nine times its annual adjusted earnings from its current level of about 3 1/2 times, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. That could mean about $845 million a year in interest payments compared with the $51 million Twitter is currently on the hook for.
That's a big bill for a company with annual free cash flow that peaked at about $856 million four years ago and went negative last year due to an $810 million payment to settle a shareholder class action lawsuit. In the first quarter, net cash from operations fell to $126 million from $390 million a year earlier, in part due to a $150 million payment related to a Federal Trade Commission complaint from 2020.
Twitter could find its fate closely tied to that of Tesla, the electric-car company Mr. Musk runs and depends on for the bulk of his wealth. Tesla's shares dropped 12% Tuesday after Twitter's deal announcement, shedding some $128 billion in market value. About $12.5 billion of the funding to buy Twitter is coming from margin loans backed by Mr. Musk's Tesla shares, meaning a sharp drop in the value of the historically volatile stock could put Mr. Musk under a margin call.
And despite Mr. Dorsey's vision of Twitter as a public service, running an always-on global publishing operation for more than 200 million vocal users carries a big price tag. Twitter in February projected capital expenditures in the range of $900 million to $950 million for this year, mainly to serve ""our existing data centers and infrastructure needs."" The company didn't update that figure in Thursday's report, and didn't hold a conference call to discuss the results, given the acquisition.
If Mr. Musk wants to go the way of subscription toward more predictable, recurring revenue, the platform will need a whole lot of new features worth paying for. Twitter Blue launched for $2.99 a month in November offering users the ability to avoid ads as they read some articles, among other features. But the new segment called ""subscription and other revenue"" posted a revenue decline of 5% from a year earlier in the first quarter, even after accounting for the impact of a divestiture. Mr. Musk tweeted about making Twitter Blue an ad-free experience. Then again, he tweeted that it should be made even cheaper.
So it seems inevitable that Twitter will need to rely on ads, at least for the foreseeable future -- to generate the cash flow needed to service the incoming debt load. Compared with social media peers like Meta Platforms' Facebook and Instagram, Twitter's ad tech is woefully behind, something new Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal, a former software engineer, was appointed to fix.
The company's average revenue per user was about 46% below that of Meta Platforms in the first quarter. To get more advertisers interested in the platform, Twitter needs to not only spend to attract more users but invest in upping its ad game.
Historically, Twitter has been heavy on brand ads, which aren't meant to elicit immediate conversion, therefore making advertisers' return on investment difficult to quantify. New Apple iOS tracking changes only compound that problem. In its fourth-quarter shareholder letter, Twitter said brand ads were still 85% of its overall advertising mix. Mr. Musk isn't buying Twitter to become an advertising innovator, but he may have no choice.
""It appears that Twitter is tantalizingly close to being in the hands of someone with the risk appetite to try a bunch of things,"" wrote AB Bernstein's Mark Shmulik.
That is good news from a debt perspective, because it seems the company will need more of all of the things, all at the same time.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Friday, the 29th of April 2022. Today, what does it mean for Twitter to go private? Plus, Biden wants more aid to Ukraine and more. Here are some of the top headlines:  Inflation has hit a new record high for the 19 countries that use the euro. Annual inflation hit 7.5% for April in the Eurozone, the highest since stats started in 1997 and the sixth record in a row. A Colorado prison inmate is the first person in the US to test positive with the current strain of avian flu. The man had direct exposure to infected poultry. And James Corden is leaving The Late Late Show. He's hosted the CBS talk show since 2015 and will leave next year. ♦ Elon Musk plans to make Twitter a private company after his $44 billion deal to buy the social media platform. But what exactly does that mean? Reporter Celina Tebor has more. Celina Tebor: Basically, Elon Musk has plans to make Twitter a private company after his $44 billion deal to buy the social media platform. It's hard to say if anything or a lot of things will change for the average user. But, if he takes the company private, that basically means that he will have a lot more flexibility to be able to make changes in the company. When a company is public, you're kind of beholden to your shareholders and to the public in general. So if you make a change to your company that is unpopular or people don't like what you're doing, then your stock might go down and that can be really volatile and be very distracting. It forces a company to make decisions that are focused more on the short term to try to get their stock up rather than maybe a decision that wouldn't be popular in a moment but could be better in the long term and make the company more valuable. That might be one of the main reasons why Musk is trying to take this company private. He has hinted at making some big changes to Twitter. He said that he wanted to add an edit button to tweets, ending Twitter's dependence on ads, and also expanding freedom of speech. He still might be able to do those things if the company were public, but if it's private, those changes and those decisions would be easier for him to make. Another big reason why Musk might want to take the company private is because then he doesn't have to deal with the SEC, which is the Securities and Exchange Commission. When you're a public company, you have to report its financial documents. That can include risk to the company, any plans that could impact its financial performance, and those are public, so anyone can look at these financial reports. Musk himself has had some issues with the SEC in the past. He said in 2018 that he had funding secured to take Tesla private, but that wasn't true. The SEC accused him of securities fraud in a civil lawsuit because of those tweets. So that really impacted Tesla negatively. Their shares dropped a lot after the SEC's claim. Musk eventually had to pay a big fine, and he actually had to step down as chairman of Tesla. It sounds like he's not a big fan of the SEC in general. He's had legal issues with them in the past. So if he took Twitter private, he just wouldn't have to deal with them as much. Taylor Wilson: For Celina's full story, check out today's episode description. ♦ Russia continued attacking Ukraine across the country yesterday that included an attack on the capital of Kyiv, hitting a residential high-rise and another building, injuring at least 10 people. The attack came just an hour after President Volodymyr Zelensky held a news conference alongside UN Secretary General António Guterres. Zelensky said the move shows Russia's disrespect for global institutions. Taylor Wilson translating for Volodymyr Zelensky: ""Today, right after our talks in Kyiv, Russian missiles flew to the city, five missiles. This says a lot about Russia's true attitude toward global institutions, about attempts of Russian authorities to humiliate the UN and everything that the organization represents. Therefore, it requires corresponding powerful reactions."" Taylor Wilson: Explosions were also reported in Chernihiv near the border with Belarus and Fastiv, a railroad hub southwest of the capital. The move seemed to point to Russia not only focusing on the Eastern Donbas region, though fighting was intense there yesterday. Ukraine is urging its allies to send more military equipment, and President Joe Biden yesterday urged Congress for an additional $33 billion in Ukraine aid. Joe Biden: The cost of this fight is not cheap, but caving to aggression is going to be more costly if we allow it to happen. We either back the Ukrainian people as they defend their country, or we stand by as the Russians continue their atrocities and aggression in Ukraine. Taylor Wilson: For all the latest from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, stay with our Live Updates page on USATODAY.com. ♦ Retail inventories are set for this summer, but beyond that, new supply chain strains could cause headaches later this year. Money reporter Medora Lee has more. Medora Lee: I think this summer everybody is pretty safe. The retailers have told me that they are well stocked. After the big Christmas rush, they were able to get their inventory restocked pretty well. The only problem is that we are going to, like everything else, have to pay higher prices for things this summer. For example, your 4th of July fireworks show, on average, it's probably going to cost about 15% more than last year. PJ Elliott: What about after the summer? What, what can we expect? Medora Lee: There's a little bit of an issue brewing. Supply chains seemed to have worsened recently in March because of the Ukraine war limiting the supply of raw materials to produce things and a lockdown in China with China's no COVID policy. They've locked down a lot of regions in China, so that has snarled the supply chain a bit. So that's slowed down things a little bit. Retailers are now looking, just in case after last year's crunch at Christmas, to try to start a little earlier to fill up their inventory for Christmas, if you can believe it. It's only, what, spring, but they're working on it. Here is the wild card. No matter how much they plan and how much they work to do that, we could also get another curve ball if there's a strike in the ports in LA. The workers there have a contract that's going to expire at the end of June. If they don't get a contract, they may go on strike. Who knows what will be on our shelves at Christmas this year. ♦ The first round of the 2022 NFL draft is in the books. The Jacksonville Jaguars went with Travon Walker first overall, the defensive end out of Georgia. Michigan defensive end, Aidan Hutchinson, went number two to the Detroit Lions, followed by LSU defensive back, Derek Stingley, to the Houston Texans at number three. As for the night's biggest surprises, Draft Wire's Luke Easterling makes sense of some big wide receiver moves. Luke Easterling: We expected a lot of these guys to go in the first round, but we didn't expect the movement we saw outside of the draft with the veteran receivers. We saw Marquise Brown, that I mentioned earlier, going to Arizona from Baltimore in a trade that involved a first round pick tonight. Then we saw the other deal with Tennessee sending A.J. Brown to Philly and him getting a new contract extension with the Eagles there, again, changing hands with a top 20 pick. Yeah, the wide receiver market, again, this started earlier in the off-season when we saw trades for Davante Adams, and we saw a trade for Tyreek Hill. We got the Deebo Samuel situation with him wanting a new contract in San Francisco as well. So the wide receiver market definitely seems to be driving this whole thing. The wide receiver drafts started driving this whole thing tonight when we saw Drake London come off the board at number eight to Atlanta, Garrett Wilson, again, to the Jets at 10. Then you saw teams trading up over and over again. We've thought for a long time that you can kind of get receivers wherever. Now it's becoming a premium position, and I think it's going to be even more valuable to these teams that don't want to pay these big contracts to the guys that are coming up in free agency, but would rather spend first round picks on these young guys and get them on cheaper deals. Taylor Wilson: Tonight the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will open things up with their first pick of the draft at number 33 overall and the start of the second round. You can watch the second and third rounds beginning at 7:00 p.m. Eastern, 4:00 Pacific on ABC, ESPN, and NFL Network. ♦ The New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival is back. The Fest took a two-year hiatus because of the pandemic, but begins today with all kinds of big headliners. They include The Who, Lionel Richie, Stevie Nicks, Willie Nelson, Foo Fighters, and more. Jazz Fest celebrates the indigenous music and culture of New Orleans and Louisiana encompassing a slew of genres like R&B, Afro-Caribbean, bluegrass, and, of course, contemporary and traditional jazz. There's also a custom that some may find unusual, jazz funerals. Musician Oscar Washington explained back in 2015. Oscar Washington: A jazz funeral is basically about the life of the person that's deceased, may it be somebody popular in the music world or in the business world or whatever, or just an ordinary person. It starts out seeming like it's a sad thing, which it is a sad occasion, but a sad occasion turning into a joyous one. It was always said to be that, if you cry when you're born into this world, and then it's a joyous occasion when you leave out. That's basically the basis of a jazz funeral. It's the times that you were born in, tough times in a tough world, and when you are gone back to glory, it's a joyous thing. Taylor Wilson: One of those set to be remembered with jazz funerals this year, according to nola.com, is George Wein, Jazz Fest founder who died last year. The festival begins today and runs through Sunday before a second weekend next Thursday through Sunday. You can read more at USATODAY.com/entertainment.

165,1-May-22,San Francisco Examiner,'Bad things are going to happen with Elon Musk and Twitter,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2659724526/BFD812D457A14912PQ/456?accountid=13946,"Headnote
Researchers fear thepolitical rancor the firm has labored to contain will explode

Elon Musk is on the social network he's trying to buy, saying politically divisive things, and suddenly it feels a lot like 2016. But this may be worse, experts say, and the impact on San Francisco maybe enormous.
""Unlike Trump, he's a real billionaire. He's got real money he can throw around, as we're seeing. And he's smart,"" says David Kirsch, a University of Maryland associate professor of business.
Kirsch researched a decade's worth of Tesla-related tweets to find a correlation between pro-Tesla bots and bumps in Tesla stock prices, as well as insights into Musk's use of Twitter.
""Musk's Twitter activity constitutes a novel tool for corporate engagement mobilization and polarization,"" Kirsch writes in a working copy of the research being presented at a conference in June. ""While Musk's deft use of Twitter delighted and engaged the fanboys, the techniques employed also mobilized a subset of Twitter users to challenge and oppose Musk, leading to polarization.""
Twitter, and one might argue many parts of America, have worked to address hate speech and other forms of polarization since former President Donald Trump made them a political tool.
""A policy unit inside of Twitter over the last couple of years was sort of focused on trying to tamp down some of the extremism, reduce some of the really harmful trolling and create more healthy conversations,"" Kirsch says, referring to Twitter's Healthy Conversations program.
Twitter declined to comment on recent political activity on the platform but said it is monitoring for any potential use of bots or manipulation.
Here is one of Musk's political tweets over the past several days - since his attempt to buy Twitter was accepted by the company:
Despite Muskjab-bing at both ends of the political spectrum and tossing out a plea for ""more love,"" the tweets have released a cascade of partisan bickering, which is always on
Twitter but may not have been so concentrated on one account since Trump was kicked off the platform in early 2021.
""Everything I hear from Elon Musk"" leads to one conclusion,"" Kirsch says. ""We know bad things are going to happen.""
And here's why this matters even more to San Francisco than anywhere else. Our city is a punching bag for right-wing vitriol on Twitter and elsewhere. Earlier this month Musk mused, in a now-deleted tweet, about turning the Twitter building on Market Street into a homeless shelter. He has speculated in fast and loose opinions on Twitter about other changes to the company. There is widespread speculation that he could move the company to
Texas, as he suddenly did Tesla after an angry outburst on Twitter.
We are not a rich guy's meme. A large community of the tech industry lives here. The Twitter building helped to rejuvenate a neighborhood. Real people work there. Those people worked very hard to repair damage from a powerful businessman who promoted his own interests by throwing out bombastic tweets that sparked identity-politics flame wars. If this is how we are going into the Musk era of Twitter, some say more political issues may lie ahead.
""What's going to happen?"" asks Christopher Bouzy, founder of the Twitter analysis company Bot Sentinel, who has tracked an influx of newly created accounts pouring into the accounts of right-wing politicians including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis since Twitter accepted Musk's acquisition.
""It's really concerning,"" Bouzy says. ""We have midterms coming up. Imagine a million new accounts tweeting about election fraud. It could be worse than 2016.""

166,1-May-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",He Always Tweeted as if He Owned the Place: [News Analysis],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2657625525/BFD812D457A14912PQ/469?accountid=13946,"And in some ways he did.Even before Elon Musk proposed a roughly $44 billion deal to take over Twitter, his tweeting habit had become an essential part of his public persona. He was the world's richest person, the founder of Tesla, the SpaceX guy, and someone who would not, or could not, stop posting.This didn't stop when Twitter accepted his offer. Mr. Musk spent Wednesday lashing out at critics, mocking coverage of the deal, posting photos of rockets and criticizing Twitter itself, amplifying right-wing criticism of the service and singling out the company's top lawyer. (The deal could still fall apart.)As Mr. Musk's Twitter use became essential to his business, it was often construed as somehow humanizing, as part of Mr. Musk's populist appeal, or as a weakness or a vice. Andy Warhol's observation that ""no amount of money can get you a better Coke"" could at times feel applicable: The man at the center of a trillion-dollar business empire, who has cultivated an identity as a bold future builder, was looking down at the same iPhone that everyone can buy, opening the same Twitter app that everyone else can download, settling scores or just deciding to post ""I put the art in fart.""This view turns Mr. Musk's plan to purchase Twitter into a pat story: rich guy who loves Twitter decides to buy it. If this isn't wrong, exactly, it misses two things. One is obvious: Someone with resources and interests as vast as Mr. Musk's has plenty of practical uses for a powerful communications platform that has permeated politics, media and economic affairs; for years, Twitter has helped him get his way.The other is less visible. While Mr. Musk taps his blue bird icon like the rest of us, the thing he actually interacts with -- and now wants to control, and fix -- isn't Twitter as anyone else knows it.Twitter has to work for the majority of people who use it, meaning people who have few followers and who rarely, if ever, tweet. It is, primarily, a service for passively consuming information -- for dipping into conversations that are happening around you, and maybe joining them.The company certainly attends to its high-profile users, who provide content that people want to follow. But beyond some point of visibility on the platform, many users outsource their presences, become risk averse and step away, or seem to lose their minds. Prominent users regularly observe how unwieldy the service becomes after 10,000, or 50,000, or 100,000 followers.Mr. Musk has more than 85 million. This makes him the seventh most followed person on the service. According to the analytics firm SocialTracker, however, his account produces by far the most engagement of his peers.Around the time Mr. Musk was making his offer, 1.86 percent of Mr. Musk's followers were interacting -- through likes and retweets -- with his posts, according to SocialTracker. That may not sound high, but the only peer account that came close in the firm's analysis was that of the soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo, with an interaction rate of 0.65 percent. Barack Obama's was 0.03 percent. Katy Perry's was 0.01 percent.This period was full of provocations and newsworthy posts from Mr. Musk; hardly a week goes by, however, that isn't. Mr. Musk's engagement rate fluctuates, and among the most highly followed users, there are some who have posted more, and others who receive greater engagement on infrequent individual posts. None, however, consistently produce as much total Twitter engagement as Mr. Musk. Earlier this month, he hinted at this dynamic:The world's wealthiest person, in other words, might also be in possession of Twitter's most frequently engaged account, and his influence only stands to grow. (In 2021, a different firm, Brandwatch, ranked his account as the fourth most influential on the platform.)Mr. Musk's singular relationship with the world around him translates to a singular relationship with Twitter, the company; its power to move markets and shape politics is plausibly worth more to him, financially, than to anybody else. His relationship with Twitter the service is, in reality, no less remote.The material existence of billionaires is not something you can easily extrapolate from a wage-earning existence, or even from considerable wealth; they do not simply live in upgraded versions of common financial realities. Their perspectives are informed by an extraordinarily rare relationship to the world, which explains, among other things, why many billionaires tend to express similar political grievances. Their wealth also affords them plenty of space to cultivate their idiosyncratic concerns. Similarly, Mr. Musk's Twitter isn't simply a busier version of everyone else's. It's a different animal entirely.Mr. Musk's Twitter, much like his money, works in ways that others' do not. He follows only 114 accounts, but his tweets usually receive tens of thousands of replies apiece, and often many more. He opens his Twitter app to what is quite likely the busiest notifications tab on the entire service, representing millions of words directed at him, largely about him.With each pull of a thumb, the tab algorithmically replenishes from a pool of more new posts than a single human could possibly hope to read. It's a Twitter that is too busy and overloaded to resemble Twitter as most people know it, with every possible notification bubble eternally reading ""99+.""Twitter, for the majority of users, is a place to follow people and maybe post. For a smaller group of users, it's a place to try to amass a following. For someone in Mr. Musk's position, ""it's like he's texting the world,"" said Jake Updegraff, a celebrity social media manager with experience running large Twitter accounts.With a large enough audience, Mr. Updegraff said, ""it's like a whole forum under everything you post."" It's an on-demand portal to the center of a media galaxy, in which a regular feed of information is replaced with an infinite stream of people addressing you by name. For the right sort of person, few things could be more intoxicating (or more debilitating).The ways in which Mr. Musk has leveraged Twitter for real-world power are measured with different tools, and on a different scale, than whatever clout he has been able to accumulate within the platform. They're what will matter most in the future, to him and to the rest of us. Mr. Musk plainly sees value in what Twitter already does and in what it has allowed him to do, and his desire to protect or extend those qualities could have serious consequences well beyond the platform.For decoding Mr. Musk's claims about how Twitter may change, his experience with the platform could be instructive. He has used Twitter to promote his companies -- Tesla in particular, but also SpaceX, the Boring company and others -- and relentlessly attack his critics and competitors.His tweets have triggered tens of billions of dollars of trading activity. Last May, after Mr. Musk posted that Tesla no longer planned to accept Bitcoin, CNBC estimated that he had briefly wiped up to $365 billion from cryptocurrency markets; likewise, his musings on Dogecoin have contributed to major spikes in its price.But the essential strangeness of his time on Twitter itself will matter, too. A man who has engaged in years of financially high-stakes Twitter exchanges, some of them with anonymous accounts, may be especially interested in ""authentication."" Someone whose account receives so much inbound material as to confound Twitter's interface, quality filters and content-sorting algorithms may assess them as broken in extremely specific ways. Someone who was fined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for tweeting, or who watched the former president of the United States, another Twitter-obsessed billionaire, get banned from the platform, brings along some heavy baggage on an already politicized crusade to restore ""free speech.""A user whose antagonistic tweets are often followed by a wave of harassment for anyone mentioned will decide what harassment is and how it's dealt with. A man whose Twitter experience already bent to his will may wonder why the whole thing shouldn't work that way. And now, maybe, it will.For Context is a column that explores the edges of digital culture.PhotographElon Musk might have Twitter's most frequently engaged account.

167,1-May-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Musk Is a Problem Masquerading as a Solution: [Op-Ed],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2657623878/BFD812D457A14912PQ/511?accountid=13946,"It is a perfect marriage for an age of plutocracy: Twitter with its serious problems and Elon Musk, the embodiment of those problems. What happens when the incarnation of a problem buys the right to decide what the problem is and how to fix it?Twitter has a disinformation problem -- fake news about Covid vaccines, climate and more running buck wild across the platform. Mr. Musk has shown himself to be a highly capable peddler of dubious claims, whether putting out misleading financial information or calling the British diver who helped rescue trapped schoolboys in Thailand a ""pedo guy.""Twitter has a racism problem. Time and again, it has failed to consequentially answer the pleas of users of color to address the bigotry and harassment that are endemic for them. Tesla, the carmaker that Mr. Musk runs, has its own racism problem, with many workers complaining to the press and California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing suing the company over an allegedly pervasive problem of racialized degradation. The agency recently described one of Tesla's plants as ""a racially segregated workplace"" rife with slurs as well as discrimination ""in job assignments, discipline, pay and promotion.""Twitter has a bullying and harassment problem, and the subtler but related challenge of bringing out the worst, not the best, in all of us. Mr. Musk is the incarnation of these problems, too. Though you might think that having more than $250 billion, according to Forbes, and wanting to solve the problems of Earth and space would fully occupy someone, he seems to have a compulsive need to belittle people and burp out his least-considered impulses and stoke bullying by his legions of admirers in a way that both reflects and shapes how Twitter is.And so it's just perfect, absolutely fitting, that this guy, of all guys, could now own Twitter.If you've been paying attention to how things work in our plutocratic society, this turn of events won't surprise you. The arsonists routinely cosplay as firefighters. Mark Zuckerberg of Meta (né Facebook) was as responsible as any American for letting hate speech and disinformation run amok on his platforms in the run-up to the 2020 elections, only to donate -- with his wife, Priscilla Chan -- $300 million to help secure that election from the forces he had helped unleash. Google, having helped shred local news gathering around the country with its massive market power in online advertising, turned around and promised to donate $15 million to the Support Local News campaign. At one point, a member of the Sackler family, whose company Purdue Pharma manufactured and promoted OxyContin and thus helped to spread the opioid epidemic, mused in leaked group chat messages I reviewed and published on my newsletter, The.Ink, about whether the company should ""commit to starting a foundation and pledge $1 billion over the next 10 years to play a leading role in addressing the epidemic.""Mr. Musk's deal for Twitter starts to feel surreal when you contemplate what it means for the idea of free speech and the attendant cultural debates about who can say what about whom. He styles himself as a libertarian defender of free speech, motivated to crack down on a Twitter management that he believes moderates the discourse to the point of censorship and suppresses certain political speech.This self-portraiture ignores the extent to which Mr. Musk has a shaky commitment to his own notion of free speech, once canceling the Tesla order of a man who dared to criticize the company on a blog and engaging in the troll baiting that can be a powerful means of making journalists and other interrogators and critics fear the mob pile-ons that could result from writing critically about his interests.Mr. Musk operates from a flawed, if widespread, misapprehension of the free speech issue facing the country. In his vision, what we may, with help from the philosopher Isaiah Berlin, call negative freedom of speech, the freedom to speak without restraint by powerful authorities, is the only freedom of speech. And so freeing Nazis to Nazi, misogynists to bully and harass and doxx and brigade women, even former president Donald Trump to possibly get his Twitter account back -- this cutting of restraints becomes the whole of the project.But there is also what we may call positive freedom of speech: affirmative steps to create conditions that allow all people to feel and be free to say what they think.Legally speaking, all American women or people of color or both who were ever talked over in a meeting or denied a book contract or not hired to give their opinion on television enjoy the protections of the First Amendment. The constitutional protection of speech does not, on its own, engender a society in which the chance to be heard is truly abundant and free and equitably distributed.""Freedom for the wolves has often meant death to the sheep,"" Mr. Berlin once said. This is a point often lost on Americans. Government -- or large centralized authority -- is one threat to liberty but not the only one. When it comes to speech, what has often kept a great many people from speaking isn't censorship but the lack of a platform. Social media, including Twitter, came along and promised to change that. But when it became a cesspit of hate and harassment for women and people of color in particular, it began to offer a miserable bargain: You can be free to say what you wish, but your life can be made unrelentingly painful if you so dare.The ""censorship"" that Mr. Musk performatively deplores consists of efforts to rectify these very real problems of harassment and abuse. Twitter has taken modest but wildly inadequate steps to improve safety on the platform. It has acknowledged it has a problem. It has recognized positive freedom of speech -- the creation of a safe and non-life-ruining environment for the airing of thoughts. And it is this that Mr. Musk and his ilk seem to loathe.This is why his deal to purchase Twitter is so dangerous. In recent years, there has been progress toward positive freedom of speech -- real work to give everyone, truly everyone, more meaningful occasion to speak. Mr. Musk apparently wants to shut that down. Instead, in a moment of proto-fascism on the political right, his priority seems to be to undam the flood of bile and bigotry and bullying and disinformation.The country already faces the very real prospect, starting at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, of a descent toward racist authoritarianism and a protracted slide away from liberal democracy. If your idea of what the country needs in this moment is less clamping down on hate and lies and more rightists gone wild, whew.The plutocrats have already rigged the economy. That's just the first step. Then you take some of the spoils and reinvest it in buying even more political influence, so that political inequality can help keep economic inequality yawning. You buy up media or social media platforms and thus can help rig the discourse in your favor, taking control of the tools used by regular people to fight back. You venture, as Mr. Musk did, to a TED conference and, without much pushback, to brand yourself as a kind of public intellectual, a thought leader, a visionary, and thereby in many people's minds you became a sage, not a robber baron.It doesn't have to be this way. We can have nice things. But we're going to have to learn to see through the fraudulent stories that elevate figures like Mr. Musk into heroes. We're going to have to legislate real guardrails -- perhaps like those created by the European Union's Digital Services Act -- on social media platforms that are too big to entrust democracy to. We're going to have to build nonprofit alternatives to the platforms and see if they can become meaningful venues.Because a society that outsources the tending of its social interactions to people who behave like sociopaths is a society asking not for freedom but for tyranny.Anand Giridharadas, the publisher of The.Ink newsletter, is the author, most recently, of ""Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World.""The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

168,2-May-22,Barron's (Online),Here's What's Next for Tesla Investors Now That Elon Musk Sold Stock,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2658035262/BFD812D457A14912PQ/124?accountid=13946,"Only Tesla CEO Elon Musk can make an annual proxy statement exciting. With Tesla's 2022 proxy statement possibly arriving as soon as Monday, there will be a couple key things that investors will want to see.
A proxy statement for an annual meeting outlines business that shareholders need to vote on, along with providing details about management compensation. Typically, the proxy statement isn't as big a deal as earnings release or annual reports.
That isn't the case for Tesla (ticker: TSLA) shareholders this year, however, thanks to Musk. He's buying Twitter (TWTR) and using Tesla stock to fund part of the purchase.
Musk sold some stock outright and raised about $8.5 billion in cash. He is also pledging about $63 billion in stock to secure a $12.5 billion loan.
According to Tesla's 2021 annual report , the 2022 proxy is slated to be ""filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 120 days of the registrant's fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.""
MORE ON MUSK
* Will He Get a Tax Deduction?
That puts the filing on or around Monday, May 2. But Tesla (ticker: TSLA) could also delay the statement filing. The company didn't return a request for comment about its plans.
For investors, Musk's pledged stock and any details about a possible stock split will be in focus.
Pledged Stock
Pledged stock is one of the two things investors will likely search the document for.
Musk has borrowed cash against his Tesla holdings before. The 2021 proxy statement says Musk has pledged more than 88 million shares as collateral for personal borrowing.
Tesla officers can take loans against their stock as long as they pledge four times the amount of the loan.
Musk's pledged stock amounts have been in Tesla's proxies for years. His borrowing was done when Tesla shares were much, much lower, and accounting expert Robert Willen says that means it likely isn't a true reflection of Musk's borrowing capacity.
The past borrowing could have even be paid back from the recent stock sales. That would reset his borrowing capacity and the proxy pledge disclosures.
In any case, Tesla investors will want to know what is happening with Musk's borrowing against his Tesla holdings.
Stock Split
The other thing investors will be looking for is information about another stock split . Tesla said in late March it intended to split its stock, like it did in 2020. But another split requires a shareholder vote to authorize more shares outstanding.
The size of the split, and the date of the annual meeting—when the increased share count can be authorized—should be included in the proxy. Tesla's 2020 split was five for one .
Some investors like splits, believing they are a bullish sign that indicates management's confidence in the future. Investors, on the other hand, typically don't like management stock sales or leverage. Insider sales can be bearish signals about the future, and too much leverage can be an overhang on any stock.
This year's Tesla proxy should provide some fodder for the bulls and the bears.
Tesla stock closed down 0.8% in Friday trading, which was actually good relative to the market. Some of the the overhang from Musk's selling abated. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 3.6% and 2.8%, respectively . The Nasdaq dropped 4.2%.

169,2-May-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Musk Joins Executives Asking Supreme Court To Kill S.E.C. Gag Rule: [Business/Financial Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2658085612/BFD812D457A14912PQ/378?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk joined an amicus brief that could have big implications for how the S.E.C. brings cases and whether defendants who settle can ever talk about them.The DealBook newsletter delves into a single topic or theme every weekend, providing reporting and analysis that offers a better understanding of an important issue in business. If you don't already receive the daily newsletter, sign up here .Elon Musk is in another fight about free speech -- this time, not on Twitter, but in the Supreme Court.Quietly, amid all of the noise about Mr. Musk's proposed acquisition of Twitter, he joined a little-noticed amicus brief filed last week that could have profound implications for how the Securities and Exchange Commission prosecutes cases and whether defendants who agree to settle can ever talk about them.Mr. Musk is now part of a group of executives who are supporting a petition filed by Barry Romeril, a former chief financial officer of Xerox, asking the Supreme Court to review a 2003 deal he made with the S.E.C. that required him to stay forever silent about a fraud case against him.Mr. Romeril's petition argues that the requirement violates his constitutional rights, and that ""no act of Congress authorizes such a sweeping restriction on freedom of speech."" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said he waived that right to deny the allegations.The group supporting him, which also includes Mark Cuban, who has fought the S.E.C. and won, beating insider trading charges, takes a different perspective: that forcing silence deprives the markets of important information.Mr. Musk has also claimed a deal he made with the S.E.C. in 2018 to settle fraud charges violates his First Amendment rights.The Tesla chief executive had moved to have his own agreement with securities regulators terminated, but a federal judge in New York denied that request on Wednesday, just two days after Twitter's board agreed to Mr. Musk's $44 billion bid to buy the company. Mr. Musk's deal requires him to get approval for his social media posts about Tesla -- the charges were related to tweets he posted saying that he had secured financing to take Tesla private -- and bans him from discussing the case.The same argument for both sides: 'Strong, vibrant markets'The S.E.C.'s gag order has been around since 1972. The practice, which allows settling defendants to neither admit nor deny wrongdoings on the condition that they never speak about the case in public, is meant to help the S.E.C. police the markets more efficiently.The rationale is that if every defendant opted out of a trial but then later reframed the charges to the public, it would undermine the validity of resolutions and the legitimacy of Wall Street's chief regulators, experts say. ""It makes everything look like a sham,"" said Harvey Pitt, a former agency chairman, who has little sympathy for retractors. ""It's unseemly for somebody who doesn't admit to then violate a gag order. They have an out -- refuse to settle.""Denials after settlement also suggest that nothing actually happened, potentially downplaying the risks surrounding an individual or entity to investors. For defendants, remaining silent about a case can be an invaluable protection. That's a choice defendants can make, said Alma Angotti, a former enforcement lawyer at the S.E.C. and the Treasury Department: ""It's a voluntary waiver.""But the executives in the amicus brief argue that the choice isn't actually a choice. They say most cases end up settling because fighting the S.E.C. is too costly. Mr. Musk has said he settled because litigation would have put Tesla under too much financial pressure and jeopardized its financing.And banning any discussions about the cases, the brief argues, actually goes against the S.E.C.'s mission to protect investors, leaving them in the dark instead about material information. The executives go on to cite the former S.E.C. chairman Arthur Levitt, who said in a 1999 speech that ""quality information is the lifeblood of strong, vibrant markets."" The group argues that the S.E.C. should be ""barred from discouraging full, frank, public discussion,"" which ensures this vibrancy.Next stop: A review from the high court?Mr. Musk calls himself a ""free speech absolutist"" and says he believes in the unfettered flow of information within the law, as the amicus brief he joined argues to the Supreme Court.Of course, the justices might not take up the case. But with Mr. Musk making headlines denouncing the gag order policy, the issue is getting a lot of attention and the New York court that just denied Mr. Musk's claims did rely on the ruling in Mr. Romeril's case.Whether his defenders would succeed in invalidating the S.E.C. provision -- even if the Supreme Court agrees to review the matter -- is very much up in the air.Throughout the justice system, defendants commonly waive rights in exchange for the many financial and reputational benefits of a swift resolution, Ms. Angotti said. In contrast, ""when you lose a trial, you bear the brunt of a finding.""But vague resolutions can be problematic in this age, according to Gurbir Grewal, the director of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division.""When it comes to accountability, few things rival the magnitude of wrongdoers admitting that they broke the law,"" Mr. Grewal said in a speech in October. ""And so, in an era of diminished trust, we will, in appropriate circumstances, be requiring admissions in cases where heightened accountability and acceptance of responsibility are in the public interest.""This could be a ""significant"" change, some lawyers say, but the S.E.C. in 2013 made a similar pledge, which proved less than revolutionary. Three years after that announcement, the agency obtained admissions from less than 2 percent of the individuals and entities charged, researchers found.Since Mr. Grewal's speech, the agency has announced 10 settlements, one of which was reached before the policy shift. Of the remaining nine, there have been two admissions of guilt. The S.E.C. did not respond to a request for comment.Though the S.E.C. can justify its gag orders, it doesn't systematically enforce them, writes Noah Feldman, a Harvard Law School professor. That failure only supports critics' arguments for more oversight of the agency, he said. And there is a danger that it can use the vow of silence to shield itself from valid critique anyway -- because most people do not have the financial wherewithal that Mr. Musk has and can't afford to risk another tussle with the government.Mr. Musk recently aired his grievances at a TED conference interview while his request to vacate his own settlement was under consideration. And he trolled the S.E.C. on Twitter on the day of the announcement of his deal to acquire the platform.Of course, Mr. Musk will not be easily silenced, and his potential acquisition of Twitter won't make him more circumspect, whatever a judge says.What do you think? Do you think ""gag orders"" are good or bad for the markets? Let us know: [email protected].Photograph(PHOTOGRAPH BY JIM WATSON/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE -- GETTY IMAGES)"
170,2-May-22,The Washington Post,Billionaireboys' club dominates discourse,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2658045079/BFD812D457A14912PQ/708?accountid=13946,"Small group controls the information, platforms of our public square
The world's richest man, Elon Musk, attacked a publication owned by the world's third-richest man, Jeff Bezos, last month for reprinting a column published by the world's 13th-richest man, Mike Bloomberg.
The Bloomberg opinion article, posted by The Washington Post, asked whether Musk's recent investment in Twitter would endanger freedom of speech. ""WaPo always good for a laugh,"" Musk wrote in a tweet, with smiling and crying emoji.
The jab underscored an unusual and consequential feature of the nation's new digital public square: Technological change and the fortunes it created have given a vanishingly small club of massively wealthy individuals the ability to play arbiter, moderator and bankroller of not only the information that feeds the nation's discourse but also the architecture that undergirds it.
Musk's agreement Monday to purchase Twitter for $44 billion - a number slightly larger than the gross domestic product of Jordan - will allow him to follow through on his stated desire to loosen restrictions on the content that crosses the fourth-largest social media network in the United States. He joins Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, No. 15 on the Forbes list of the world's wealthiest, who has autonomy over the algorithms and moderation policies of the nation's top three social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram and Facebook Messenger.
The information that courses over these networks is increasingly produced by publications controlled by fellow billionaires and other wealthy dynasties, who have filled the void of the collapsing profit-making journalism market with varying combinations of self-interest and altruism. It is a situation that has alarmed policy experts at both ends of the increasingly vicious ideological and partisan divides.
""This is almost becoming like junior high school for billionaires,"" Brookings Institution scholar Darrell M. West said of the new information magnates. ""The issue is we are now very dependent on the personal whims of rich people, and there are very few checks and balances on them. They could lead us in a liberal, conservative or libertarian direction, and there is very little we can do about that.""
Nearly all of these executives, including Musk, claim benevolent motivations, and many, like Bezos, who owns The Post, have established firewalls of editorial independence that protect against their direct influence on articles such as this one. But the power to fund, shape and hire leaders that decide what is shared and what is covered has nonetheless become the subject of its own political conflict. Partisans find themselves celebrating the autonomy of the rich men who they see as serving their interests, while simultaneously objecting to the unchecked power of those who don't.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) - who has for months railed against the dangers of what he has called ""overlords in Silicon Valley"" censoring conservative news and views - called Musk's Twitter purchase this week ""without exaggeration the most important development for free speech in decades."" Liberal activists and even some Twitter employees, meanwhile, reacted with fears that more disinformation and hate speech, which is largely protected under federal law, might soon be coursing at greater volume through the nation's intellectual bloodstream.
""I don't think it's a great commentary on the state of affairs that we are relying on a billionaire oligarch to save free speech online,"" said Jon Schweppe, policy director of the American Principles Project, a conservative think tank pushing for less moderation of conservative views on social networks. ""It's unfortunate that we need to have a hero. But we do.""
Musk has not been specific about what he plans to do with Twitter, although he has dropped a steady stream of hints, including his objection to private ""censorship that goes far beyond the law."" He has suggested new monetization strategies and less reliance on advertising, while sharing memes that irreverently describe Twitter's ""left wing bias"" and dismisses as extreme the views of ""woke"" liberals.
""The far left hates everyone, including themselves!"" he tweeted Friday. ""But I'm no fan of the far right either. Let's have less hate and more love.""
Ironically, his moves have been endorsed by former Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey (No. 396 on the Forbes list) - one of the ""overlords"" who Cruz attacked - who has argued that freeing the company from the burdens of a public company will allow it to better serve as a public utility.
""Taking it back from Wall Street is the correct first step,"" he tweeted Monday. ""I trust [Musk's] mission to extend the light of consciousness.""
Activists on the left, who have a different vision of public square moderation, have scoffed at the notion that any individual - White men who dwell in bubbles of limitless luxury, no less - should be able to filter information for the country's voters.
""Even if Elon Musk was the smartest person on earth, had the best heart, had been touched by God, I wouldn't want him to have that much power,"" said Robert McChesney, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who has advocated against concentration in media ownership. ""It is antithetical to democratic political theory.""
Other billionaires, in the meantime, have been branching out to fund broader parts of the nation's democratic process, moving beyond even their outsize role as donors to political campaigns and organizations. Zuckerberg spent $419.5 million to fund election administrators during the 2020 elections, sparking outrage among Republicans and cheers among Democrats. ""I agree with those who say that government should have provided these funds, not private citizens,"" Zuckerberg said in a statement at the time.
Many of his billionaire peers have been expanding investments into journalism and punditry, aiming in many cases to shape voter understanding of their place in the world. Laurene Powell Jobs (No. 111) bought a majority stake in the Atlantic in 2017. Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff (No. 309) bought Time magazine in 2018.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates (No. 4) has spent tens of millions of dollars through his foundation to directly fund journalism at outlets such as NPR that cover issues he cares about, such as health and the environment. Others have funded more narrow publishing efforts. The wealthy Chinese exile Guo Wengui has worked on media ventures with Stephen K. Bannon, who was an adviser to President Donald Trump.
But these are merely the most recent forays by the uber-wealthy into traditional media ownership. Rupert Murdoch (No. 85) made his first purchase in the United States in 1976 when he bought the New York Post before launching Fox News and expanding to the Wall Street Journal, while Bloomberg created Bloomberg LP in 1981.
Both Murdoch and Bloomberg have invested heavily in opinion-driving journalism, through Fox News and Bloomberg Opinion, respectively. They follow in the tradition that emerged in the last century, when wealthy families and scions, such as William Randolph Hearst and the Sulzberger family that owns the New York Times, came to dominate the largest newsgathering organizations.
The role of social media networks, which have largely replaced print newspapers as the way most Americans get their information, has complicated the issue, in part because so few networks are so dominant. A 2019 poll by the Pew Research Center found 62 percent of Americans felt that social media companies have ""too much control over the news people see.""
Brendan Nyhan, a Dartmouth political scientist who has studied misinformation and its effect on democracy, said social media allows Zuckerberg and Musk to have ""greater influence over the flow of information than has been possible in human history.""
Of particular concern to Nyhan is the lack of transparency over the way these platforms control the information on them. Democrats and Republicans have recently expressed interest in increased antitrust enforcement, as well as new legal restrictions that condition the immunity social networks enjoy from lawsuits on their agreement to properly moderate debate. There are, naturally, deep divisions about what that moderation should look like.
In the European Union, lawmakers have been pushing forward laws that require social networks to crack down on speech illegal in Europe that is generally protected by the U.S. Constitution. The proposed laws also require algorithmic transparency and give consumers more control over how their own information is used.
""The best way to articulate this is: A recalibration between these big tech companies and the oligarchs and the American people is warranted,"" said Kara Frederick, director of tech policy at the Heritage Foundation, who has been critical of the European approach but supports more regulation in the United States. ""We can strip immunity from tech companies if they censor political or other views protected by the constitution.""
Ben Wizner, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's speech, privacy and technology project, said the key challenge presented by individual control of social media and journalism is, at root, about scale.
""We are talking about a small handful of people who now exercise extraordinary control over the boundaries of our discourse,"" Wizner said. ""The importance for media and journalism is that there be a diverse ecosystem that represents the interests of many, not just of the few.""
Of course, billionaires with an ax to grind don't need media ownership to change the information landscape. PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor Peter Thiel (No. 552), who has given millions to GOP candidates this cycle, famously ran the gossip site Gawker out of business by secretly funding Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against the site after it had published a recording of Hogan having sex with a friend's estranged wife.
For his part, Musk appears to be enjoying the public focus on his enormous new power. He recently tweeted an insult directed at fellow billionaire Gates, in apparent retaliation for Gates having shorted Tesla's stock. Musk posted a photo of Gates wearing a blue polo shirt stretched across his stomach next to an emoji of a pregnant man, and captioned the images with a crass observation about Gates's girth.
When Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) posted a tweet Friday criticizing when ""some billionaire with an ego problem unilaterally controls a massive communication platform and skews it,"" Musk responded by suggesting the congresswoman had a romantic interest in him.
""Stop hitting on me, I'm really shy,"" he tweeted.
Ocasio-Cortez replied, ""I was talking about Zuckerberg but ok.""

171,3-May-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk Plans to Take Twitter Public a Few Years After Buyout; Tesla chief has been speaking to investors including private-equity firms about participating in deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2658948761/BFD812D457A14912PQ/102?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk, who has agreed to take Twitter Inc. private in a $44 billion deal , has told potential investors he could return the social-media company to public ownership after just a few years.
Mr. Musk said he plans to stage an initial public offering of Twitter in as little as three years of buying it, according to people familiar with the matter. The deal is expected to close later this year, subject to conditions including the approval of Twitter shareholders and regulators, the company has said.
Mr. Musk, the Tesla Inc. chief, has been speaking to investors such as private-equity firms, which could help lower the $21 billion he plans to kick in to help pay for the deal . The rest of the money is coming from loans. One firm considering participating is Apollo Global Management Inc., The Wall Street Journal has reported.
Private-equity firms often take companies private with an eye toward fixing them up outside of the spotlight and then taking them public again within five years or so. Mr. Musk's signal that he plans to do something similar could help assure potential investors that he would work quickly to improve Twitter's business operations and profitability.

The Tesla CEO was a millionaire in his 20s and has parlayed each business success into new endeavors
He has given few details about his exact plans for the company other than that he wants it to be less censorious in content moderation. At one point he said he doesn't care whether he makes money on the deal. Mr. Musk has a history of missing his timelines and targets at Tesla, the electric-car company.
Even though Mr. Musk is the world's richest man , scraping together the funds to seal the deal was no mean feat. Once he managed to do so, Twitter's expected resistance eased and the two sides quickly agreed to a deal at his original offer price of $54.20 a share.

172,3-May-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Musk Wings It In Negotiating His Takeovers: [National Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2658462524/BFD812D457A14912PQ/289?accountid=13946,"As Twitter negotiated a sale to Elon Musk last month, the social media company pulled out a corporate takeover playbook.Mr. Musk, the world's richest man, did the opposite.He had no plan for how to finance or manage Twitter, Mr. Musk told a close associate. To push the $44 billion deal through, he turned to a small inner circle, including Jared Birchall, the head of his family office, and Alex Spiro, his personal lawyer. And when Twitter resisted his overtures, Mr. Musk pressured the company with a string of tweets -- some mischievous, some barbed and all impulsive.Tech billionaires such as Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos and Larry Page often make long-term plans and manage their affairs through a corporate machinery of lawyers, communications professionals and different advisers. Mr. Musk, 50, operates unlike any of them.To a degree unseen in any other mogul, the entrepreneur acts on whim, fancy and the certainty that he is 100 percent right, according to interviews with more than 30 current and former employees, investors and others who have worked with him. While Mr. Musk has successfully bet on electric cars, space travel and artificial intelligence, he often wings it in the biggest moments, eschews experts and relies almost solely on his own counsel, they said.To operate this way, Mr. Musk has constructed an insular world of about 10 confidants who mostly agree with him and carry out his bidding. They include his younger brother, Kimbal Musk; Mr. Birchall; Mr. Spiro; and various chiefs of staff. To manage his many ideas, Mr. Musk continuously creates new companies, most of which are structured so that he remains in charge. His trusted lieutenants often work across his far-flung empire of businesses.Once Mr. Musk has identified each company's key project -- what he calls its ""critical path"" -- he takes over to ensure that his vision is met, controlling the smallest aspects of how the technologies are built and deployed. His brilliance has spawned the world's most valuable automaker and an innovative rocket company, and it has earned the respect -- and fear -- of his engineers.Relying on his small crew and hewing to his own thinking have enabled Mr. Musk to call the shots and conduct himself with few restraints, turning him into a Howard Hughes-like figure of the modern age -- even as his seat-of-the-pants methods often create bedlam.Mr. Musk works in a way that only the ""most confident leaders do,"" said Tim Draper, a venture capitalist who backed Mr. Musk's electric automaker, Tesla, and his rocket company, SpaceX. ""Think J.F.K., George Washington and Ronald Reagan.""At a 2018 conference, Mr. Musk explained that he behaved on impulse. It was a lesson he learned more than 25 years ago after founding his first start-up, Zip2, he said.""I don't really have a business plan,"" he said. ""I had a business plan way back in the Zip2 days. But these things are always wrong, so I just didn't bother with business plans after that.""How Mr. Musk operates has implications for what he might do with Twitter. The San Francisco company, which the billionaire is set to take ownership of in the next six months, has been in an uproar over the deal. As the takeover drama played out, its new proprietor publicly criticized the platform, took aim at senior Twitter executives who oversee speech rules on the service and needled Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Mr. Gates on the site.Last week, Parag Agrawal, Twitter's chief executive, told the company's more than 7,000 employees that once Mr. Musk takes over, ""we don't know what direction this company will go in."" Twitter declined to comment for this article.Mr. Musk, who did not respond to requests for comment, is far from ignorant of the chaos that he leaves behind. In emails about a 2018 defamation case stemming from one of his tweets, Mr. Musk called himself an idiot in vulgar terms. In a deposition over a botched effort to take Tesla private that same year, he was rueful, saying, ""If I had a hindsight machine, that would be really great.""Keeping ControlBorn in Pretoria, South Africa, Mr. Musk became interested in computers and programming languages as a child. After starting college in Canada, he moved to the United States in 1992, graduating with degrees in economics and physics from the University of Pennsylvania and then enrolling as a Ph.D. student in physics at Stanford University.Almost immediately, Mr. Musk dropped out of Stanford to pursue a career in business. His first start-up, in 1995, a travel guide service called Zip2, was a family affair with his brother, Kimbal. The computer maker Compaq later bought Zip2 for over $300 million.In 1999, Mr. Musk helped found X.com, an online payments company that eventually became known as PayPal. There, he began publicly making business declarations, even if his employees weren't prepared.In a live television appearance that year, Mr. Musk said the company would guarantee transactions on all auctions on eBay, the e-commerce site. It was the first time his engineers had heard about the feature, said a person who worked with him at the time. They had to race to make the feature a reality, the person said.In 2000, X.com's board and the executive Peter Thiel ousted Mr. Musk over disagreements about the company's direction. It was a painful exit for Mr. Musk, who soon embraced the idea that he -- and he alone -- should be in charge of future ventures.As Mr. Musk built new businesses -- he founded SpaceX in 2002 and invested in Tesla in 2004 -- he ensured he could exert his will at each company. He poured more than $100 million of his own money into SpaceX in its early years and has majority control of the firm. At Tesla, Mr. Musk owns a 16 percent stake and stocked the board with friendly faces, including his brother and Antonio Gracias, a longtime friend and investor.""It's OK to have your eggs in one basket as long as you control what happens to that basket,"" he told Inc. Magazine in 2007.Kimbal Musk and Mr. Gracias, who left Tesla's board last year and serves as a SpaceX director, declined to comment for this article.Today, Mr. Musk oversees or is associated with at least a dozen companies, including public ones, private ones and holding companies such as Wyoming Steel, which he uses to manage real estate. His net worth stands at about $250 billion.A Close CircleAs Mr. Musk established more companies, he collected associates he could deploy across many of the endeavors.One was Mary Beth Brown, who was hired in 2002 to essentially be Mr. Musk's executive assistant. Known as M.B., she soon became a kind of chief of staff, handling media requests and some financial matters for SpaceX and Tesla, as well as helping to manage Mr. Musk's personal life, said Ashlee Vance, the author of ""Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future.""That same year, Mr. Musk hired Gwynne Shotwell as SpaceX's seventh employee. As the rocket maker's president and chief operating officer, Ms. Shotwell has overseen the company's growth, becoming one of Mr. Musk's longest-lasting employees.At a conference in 2018, Ms. Shotwell explained how she managed Mr. Musk.""When Elon says something, you have to pause and not immediately blurt out, 'Well, that's impossible,' or, 'There's no way we're going to do that. I don't know how,""' she said. ""So you zip it, and you think about it. And you find ways to get that done.""Ms. Brown, who no longer works for Mr. Musk, couldn't be reached for comment. Ms. Shotwell didn't respond to a request for comment.Mr. Musk also began treating his portfolio of companies as a single organization.In 2015, he and Sam Altman, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, and a group of researchers founded OpenAI, a lab developing artificial intelligence to benefit humanity. Within months, Mr. Musk enlisted several OpenAI researchers to help with Tesla's assisted driving system, Autopilot, two people with knowledge of the work said. He later appointed an OpenAI researcher, Andrej Karpathy, as Tesla's senior director of artificial intelligence.Seven months after starting OpenAI, Mr. Musk founded Neuralink, a company that aims to build a computer interface for the brain. OpenAI and Neuralink moved into the same building in San Francisco's Mission district. For a while, the companies held group lunches together with the idea that they would collaborate.Around that time, Mr. Musk brought in Mr. Birchall, a former Morgan Stanley banker, as the head of his family office. When Neuralink was established, Mr. Birchall was listed as the chief executive, chief financial officer and president, according to corporate filings. His name appeared on correspondence with San Francisco city officials when the company sought permission to do research on animals.Mr. Birchall has since become Mr. Musk's personal fixer, heading up the billionaire's philanthropic efforts and registering companies for him, including Pravda Corp., an idea for a website that would publicly rate news outlets and journalists. Mr. Birchall did not respond to requests for comment.Mercurial ManagementBy 2016, Mr. Musk's business empire was sprawling. In pressure-filled situations, the billionaire sometimes showed an ugly side of his management style.In June 2016, Tesla was dealing with the fatal crash of Joshua Brown, who had used Autopilot technology when his car plowed into a tractor-trailer crossing a highway. In a call between Tesla and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that month, Paul Hemmersbaugh, then the general counsel for the regulator, explained it was opening a formal investigation into Autopilot.Mr. Musk erupted, four people with knowledge of the incident said. Screaming into the phone, he threatened to sue the regulator if the investigation went forward, they said. (Mr. Musk backed down the next day, and the agency proceeded with the investigation.)Mr. Musk's seat-of-the-pants decisions often tormented his employees. In September 2016, he traveled to Guadalajara, Mexico, to make an announcement at the International Astronautical Congress about SpaceX's plan to transport humans to Mars. But up until he stepped onstage, some of his executives, who had to brief NASA and other partners, had no idea what he planned to say, a senior official said.Mr. Musk then gave a casual hourlong presentation, suggesting there was a ""quite high"" probability that people would die on the first trip to Mars.At Tesla, engineers working on Autopilot were taken aback by Mr. Musk's tweet in 2016 announcing when Tesla would unveil a new version of the system. In 2017, they were surprised by another tweet from their boss saying that a more advanced version of Autopilot, called Full Self Driving, was six months away, former employees said. (Full Self Driving, which is in beta testing, is not widely available.)A Year of TurbulenceA defining year for Mr. Musk was 2018, when his solo, impetuous style came back to bite him.At Tesla, Mr. Musk pushed to ramp up manufacturing of the company's Model 3 sedan. Believing only he could get the task done, he fired the executive in charge of manufacturing and decided to revamp the entire assembly line of the company's factory in Fremont, Calif., himself. Often, he slept in a conference room at the factory.""There were times when I didn't leave the factory for three or four days -- days when I didn't go outside,"" Mr. Musk told The New York Times in 2018. (Tesla eventually said it had hit its production targets.)Mr. Musk was sometimes joined at the factory by Sam Teller, a de facto chief of staff, who had a sleeping bag there, a person who visited said. Mr. Teller juggled duties with Shivon Zilis, a former venture capitalist, with both holding titles at multiple Musk-run companies.Mr. Teller, who left Mr. Musk's employment in 2019, didn't respond to requests for comment. Ms. Zilis, who still works for the billionaire, declined to comment.After the Model 3 overhaul, Mr. Musk decided he was tired of Tesla's navigating the pressures of the public market. On Aug. 2, 2018, he drafted an email to the company's board with the subject line: ""Offer to Take Tesla Private at $420."" It contained few details about how the offer would be funded.Mr. Musk's inner circle was elated. ""I think Tesla being private would be awesome!"" Kimbal Musk, a Tesla board member, texted his brother. The messages were included in court filings that were made public last month.On Aug. 7, Mr. Musk announced the idea, tweeting: ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.""""Way to just light the torch paper!"" James Murdoch, the media mogul who sits on Tesla's board, texted Mr. Musk.""Everything's better with fire,"" Mr. Musk replied.Despite the cheerleading from insiders, Mr. Musk's effort failed. The funding he had counted on to take Tesla private didn't materialize. Tesla shareholders sued him for securities fraud in August 2018. A month later, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Mr. Musk with securities fraud.""Elon's approach of doing business is minimum level of documentation,"" Deepak Ahuja, Tesla's then-chief financial officer, said in a 2018 deposition. ""He really does do business based on a verbal commitment and a handshake.""Mr. Musk settled with the S.E.C. that year and was fined $20 million. The shareholder lawsuit is ongoing.At the same time, Mr. Musk became embroiled in a defamation case with Vernon Unsworth, a British cave explorer. Mr. Unsworth had criticized Mr. Musk for unnecessarily building a submarine for a 2018 rescue of boys trapped in a cave in Thailand. In response, Mr. Musk called Mr. Unsworth a ""pedo guy"" on Twitter, prompting a defamation suit.Behind the scenes, Mr. Birchall hired someone who posed as a private investigator to dig up information on Mr. Unsworth because he had ""an instinct to protect"" his boss, according to court documents and depositions. Mr. Musk sent some of those details on Mr. Unsworth to a reporter. The private eye ended up being a fraud with bogus information.In emails sent to a public relations consultant released ahead of the trial, Mr. Musk said sending information to a reporter was ""one of the dumbest things I've ever done."" (The reporter now works at The Times.)Mr. Musk hired Mr. Spiro, a celebrity lawyer whose clients include Jay-Z, to lead his defense. In December 2019, Mr. Musk was found not liable for defamation after Mr. Spiro argued that his client's tweet had been a joke. The two have been close since.'Maximum Fun'Throughout many ups and downs, Mr. Musk had one constant: Twitter.He typically tweets a dozen times or more in a day to his more than 90 million followers, shooting barbs at Tesla short sellers, sharing memes and ruminating on the pandemic, politics and Dogecoin. In 2020, he eliminated Tesla's communications department, partly because he felt he could go directly to fans and customers through Twitter, three former employees said.Mr. Musk's love for the social media company moved him to buy it. To do the deal last month, he had Mr. Birchall handle logistics and communications from Twitter, according to financial documents. Mr. Spiro talked to the news media. Mr. Musk also created three new companies named X Holdings I, II and III, which were involved in financing the Twitter transaction, according to securities filings.After winning Twitter last week and celebrating with a tweet showing heart and rocket emojis, Mr. Musk turned up in Boca Chica, Texas, to discuss a new SpaceX rocket engine with an engineering team. On Wednesday, he wrote, ""Let's make Twitter maximum fun!""Jack Ewing and Lauren Hirsch contributed reporting.Jack Ewing and Lauren Hirsch contributed reporting.PhotographElon Musk, center, in April 2019 in New York.

173,3-May-22,USA Today (Online),"Elon Musk is no doctor, but he plays one on Twitter. Doesn't he realize that's dangerous?",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2658411765/BFD812D457A14912PQ/703?accountid=13946,"I think I may have COVID. Or is it flu, or maybe allergies, or strep throat or maybe a cold? What should I be taking? Should I quarantine just in case, or carry on, maybe with a mask? Wait, what do you mean you're not a doctor? Why are you telling me what to do? Sorry, I don't really have anything except a new reason to dread Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter: He's dispensing medical advice based on stuff he hears from people he knows. He says he wants to make Twitter ""maximum fun,"" but the oblivious Dr. Musk could end up causing harm that's real and even deadly. The moment that drove this home to me was when Marc Andreessen, a tech billionaire with 1 million followers, posted musings Friday about his experiences with Adderall (prescribed for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and Wellbutrin (an anti-depressant). Replied Dr. Musk: ""Wellbutrin is way worse than Adderall imo. It should be taken off the market. Every time that drug has come up in conversation, someone at the table has a suicide or near suicide story.""  Opinions in your inbox: Get a digest of our takes on current events every day A person with no training or expertise giving a medical opinion is bad enough. Add to the mix Musk's more than 90 million followers (yes, you read that right), and it's a catastrophe in the making. Haven't we already gone through this with ivermectin, sunlight and bleach injections to cure COVID-19? But instead of learning from the mistakes of Dr. Donald Trump, medical genius, Musk is in contention for the title of misinformer in chief. Don't go to Musk for medical advice  Worries about the Tesla CEO and SpaceX owner have mostly centered on what exactly he would allow to be said on Twitter in the name of free speech – and how seriously he would take his new role if the deal went through and he truly became Twitter's owner. I'm now worried that he wouldn't understand that role at all.  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y., 12.9 million followers) expressed her concerns recently in a pointed tweet: ""Tired of having to collectively stress about what explosion of hate crimes is happening bc some billionaire with an ego problem unilaterally controls a massive communication platform and skews it because Tucker Carlson or Peter Thiel took him to dinner and made him feel special.""  Musk's response: ""Stop hitting on me, I'm really shy.""  Columnist Suzette Hackney: Elon Musk could help change the fabric of American society. Instead he bought Twitter. Suffice it to say that did not address the question of what, if anything, he intends to do about hate speech on the platform. Or whether he will be less dismissive and more accurate in his own tweets. The thing is, people listen to Musk. For instance, Musk tweets were rocket fuel for exploding interest in the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, including Trump’s. The study Musk tweeted was badly flawed and eventually even Trump stopped pushing people to take the drug.  And following Musk's Wellbutrin tweet last week, Pranay Pathole – an IT professional with over 143,000 followers who became Musk’s Twitter “friend” after solving a tech problem for him – asked him: ""What do u think about Ritalin? Is that a good replacement for Adderall& Wellbutrin? Ritalin works sooner and reaches peak performance more quickly than Adderall does."" My young patient struggled with depression: And TikTok was making it worse. Instead of saying ""talk to your doctor,"" Dr. Musk offered his medical opinion: ""I have not heard bad things about Ritalin, which is not good to say it’s good, just haven’t heard bad things about it."" And followed up with another anecdote: ""A friend just emailed me about her bad Ritalin experience. Best to be cautious with all neurotransmitter drugs."" Doctors were punchlines in Trump era The Trump era featured spurious, sometimes comical medicine, even from real doctors. Dr. Harold Bornstein kicked it off in a December 2015 summary of Trump's health. “His physical strength and stamina are extraordinary,” Bornstein wrote. “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” (Spoiler: Bornstein told CNN in 2018 that Trump had dictated the letter.)  White House Dr. Ronny Jackson was equally effusive about Trump’s health in a 2018 news conference – his “incredibly good genes,” his “excellent” overall and cardiac health, his “exceedingly” good performance on a cognitive test, his potential to live to be 200, or at least through two terms, if he ate better.  Columnist Rex Huppke: Marjorie Taylor Greene's Bible must be a lot different from my version filled with compassion Trump later hired Dr. Scott Atlas, a magnetic resonance imaging specialist with no expertise on infectious disease, to advise him on the coronavirus; the results were not optimal. In this year's Pennsylvania GOP Senate primary, Trump endorsed celebrity TV heart surgeon Mehmet Oz, who has promoted unscientific, sometimes false and potentially dangerous information about treatments for COVID and other conditions. More from Jill Lawrence: Why I'm still on Facebook, even though it's dividing and inciting America for profit Zelenskyy's path from comedy to tragedy: Can he save Ukraine from Russian war invaders? Musk, who despite his tweet to AOC is never shy, has been opining on COVID since the pandemic began. He has opposed vaccine and stay-at-home mandates, and his brash takes often have been wrong.  “The coronavirus panic is dumb,” he tweeted on March 6, 2020, of the virus that has now killed nearly 1 million Americans. He predicted soon after that “the panic will cause more harm than the virus.” He called lockdown restrictions “fascist” and said he was outraged by the “forcible imprisoning of people in their homes.” He also said he would refuse any future COVID vaccine (a position he later reversed). Facts should trump fun on Twitter Like Musk, I am not shy about sharing my opinions. But whether you agree or disagree, they are based on reporting and research, and argued on the facts. I would never tell my modest 26,250 Twitter followers to take or not take a certain drug – say, Wellbutrin – based on what I heard from a friend or relative. But I might cite research. And as it happens, authoritative National Institutes of Health studies show that bupropion, the generic marketed as Wellbutrin and other brand names, is safe, effective and well-tolerated. Mr. Musk, you are not a doctor, and tarring meds that may be keeping people alive is not ""maximum fun."" You can still choose your Twitter adventure. I hope it ends well, for you and for us.

That's what employees of then-millionaire Elon Musk would tell recruits of X.com, the virtual bank he founded in 1999 that eventually became PayPal. Earlier that year, the sale of Mr. Musk's first startup, Zip2, netted him roughly $21 million, much of which he invested in an effort to disrupt banking, investing and payment systems.
Back then, financial transactions looked very different from today. As Jimmy Soni writes in "" The Founders ,"" his history of PayPal, ""In the late 1990s, only 10% of all online commerce was conducted digitally—the vast majority of transactions still ended with a buyer sending a check by mail."" Think about that. At a time when the U.S. Postal Service was still a major factor in the buying and selling of goods and services, Mr. Musk and his eventual partners, Peter Thiel and Max Levchin—X.com and their firm, Confinity, merged in March 2000—foresaw today's increasingly cashless world.
Such thinking is a key to understanding Mr. Musk's immense wealth. He bet much of his Zip2 gains on a financial future that confused most observers or was roundly dismissed. Yet PayPal's market capitalization is about $106 billion—a powerful indicator that few perceived this huge, untapped market. As an early X.com employee told Mr. Soni, the big credit-card companies ""should have killed us when they could have."" Or the banks. Or any well-capitalized enterprise eager to pursue a lucrative business line.
But none did. What Messrs. Musk, Thiel and Levchin envisioned was seen by others as delusional. This would eventually help make them their millions, but at the outset it made financing elusive. As Mr. Musk told Mr. Soni, PayPal ""was a hard company to keep alive."" If PayPal had been perceived as credible, the financing to keep it afloat would have been abundant—and so would the competition.
In 2002, PayPal went public and swiftly was bought by eBay in a $1.4 billion stock deal. Mr. Musk's net worth skyrocketed, but only after he risked much of his wealth on a business that few thought had a chance of succeeding.
Mr. Musk again put most of his gains to work, with investments in Solar City, SpaceX and Tesla. At present, Solar City's market cap is in the $2 billion range, SpaceX is estimated to be worth $100 billion, and Tesla is valued by investors at almost $1 trillion—but they're all speculative concepts, like PayPal. The companies' market capitalizations bear this out. While debate rages about markets' efficiency or lack thereof, no one disputes that $20 lying on the ground won't last long. Multibillion-dollar market-share endeavors disappear even faster, unless they're unknown, ridiculed as unnecessary, or seen as impossible.
This is worth remembering when considering Mr. Musk's purchase of Twitter. His much-publicized bid stirred little competition, perhaps because some feared getting into a bidding war with someone of his net worth. But a more realistic scenario is that Mr. Musk sees possibilities for Twitter that the rest of us don't—possibilities so distant from the Twitter we know that Mr. Musk is taking the underperforming social-media company private—at least for a few years —to put his contrarian stamp on it.
Mr. Musk sits atop the wealth pyramid not because he's a copycat, or because he has prudently invested in index funds, but because with each venture he has tried to usher a widely dismissed or unseen future into the present. Mr. Musk is incredibly rich because he continues to pursue the impossible.

175,6-May-22,Barron's (Online),It's Not Just Tesla. 8 Other Stocks to Play the Future of Transportation.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2660156013/BFD812D457A14912PQ/30?accountid=13946,"We once thought the future of transportation meant George Jetson's flying car. Instead, we got Elon Musk's Tesla—the company and the electric car—whose twin successes jolted the global automotive industry and are speeding the (eventual) demise of the internal combustion engine.
One might think, from the stock market or Twitter, that Tesla and electrification are the only things that matter today in the world of transportation. But there's a lot more to the story, including autonomous driving, ride-sharing, robotics, and mobility technology, to name just a few salient trends. Plus, there are 300 million vehicles already on the road in the U.S. alone that still need care and repair.
What does all of this mean for investors? That's the subject of Barron's first-ever transportation roundtable, which explores the outlook for auto makers old and new, and the technologies shaping the industry's future. Our panelist include Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, whose Future Fund Active exchange-traded fund (ticker: FFND) invests in companies capitalizing on ""secular megatrends""; Pierre Ferragu, head of the global technology infrastructure research team at New Street Research; Abhijit Ganguly, managing director of Goodyear Ventures, the venture-capital arm of Goodyear Tire & Rubber (GT); and A. Carolina Jolly, senior research analyst at Gamco Investors (GBL).
Transportation Roundtable Panelists
* Gary Black Managing Partner,The Future Fund
* Pierre Ferragu Global Team Head Technology Infrastructure, New Street Research
* Abhijit Ganguly Managing Director, Goodyear Ventures
* A. Carolina Jolly Senior Research Analyst, Gamco Investors
The roundtable took place in mid-April. An edited version of the discussion follows.
Barron's: Let's start with an overview of this sprawling subject. What are the most important trends in transportation that investors need to follow and understand?
Gary Black: The No. 1 trend is that EV adoption is exploding. Battery-operated EVs were about 6.6% of total industry sales globally last year. We estimate they were 9% in this year's first quarter, and will be about 30% in 2025, rising to 60% by 2030. That is reshaping the competitive landscape, similar to the way Apple [AAPL] reshaped the mobile-phone landscape when it introduced the iPhone in 2007.
The No. 2 trend is autonomy, and it involves two factors: self-driving cars and robo-taxis. An industry will develop around summoning a self-driving car that will take you where you want to go, as you can do today in Phoenix and San Francisco. The global ride-hailing industry today is about $300 billion in revenue, including taxis.
Third, Tesla (TSLA) has developed a direct-to-consumer sales model within the EV industry. It avoids dealerships, and uses social media instead of advertising. That's a big trend that we have to pay attention to.
Fourth, as we take out gas stations and install EV charging stations, a lot of infrastructure will need to be built. Range anxiety is still the No. 1 reason why people don't buy EVs. We need much better infrastructure to enable drivers to go from New York to California without worrying about running out of juice. These are the four big trends we're watching.
Pierre Ferragu: To me, the most important trend is electrification. The first order of transformation is that an oil-consuming, polluting powertrain is being replaced by an electric powertrain, itself a monster evolution of a $2 trillion industry. Then, there is the spin that Tesla is bringing to it. Tesla is revolutionizing this market the way Apple revolutionized the $50 billion mobile-phone market. It is redefining the category and attracting a large number of buyers to a significantly more expensive, higher-value product.
Second, the gig economy and more autonomous mobility are transforming personal transportation. This means delivery eventually can become real-time, and cheap. We will be able to leverage technology to make customer transportation and delivery much more efficient.
A. Carolina Jolly: I want to talk about the vehicles we currently have, and how much we rely on them. I am focused on logistics: housing and servicing these vehicles, and warehousing parts, and how these segments of the auto industry will adapt to trends such as EVs, autonomous vehicles, and shared mobility. The supply chain is also important. As the industry trends toward EVs, how is it going to source components and raw materials? And, how is it going to educate technicians in the future? Many auto companies are being driven by great ideas, but for these ideas to fully penetrate the market, people need to learn to support them.
Abhijit Ganguly: We see three big plays from a corporate venture-capital-deployment standpoint. Robotics is intersecting with mobility, and at that intersection, we find autonomous driving. Advanced driver-assistance systems are improving.
We also see the connected car. More vehicle components are getting smarter, which creates opportunities for the automotive industry to onboard value-added products that improve safety and efficiency.
Then, we see contactless digital technologies that were pulled forward by the Covid pandemic. The convenience these technologies can deliver to end users will become a big deal. In our world, that plays out in a few different ways. Mobile car care is one example: People are choosing to have their cars serviced in their own driveways, at the airport, or elsewhere. Also, companies are starting to use sidewalk robots to deliver groceries, improving the last-mile delivery space.
Last, but not least, sustainability is becoming a big factor in mobility. Sustainability at Goodyear means we balance environmental, social, and financial demands without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. We are stressing sustainability in our Goodyear Ventures investments by enabling electrification, accessibility, driving safety, and less congestion through tire-intelligence collaborations.
EVs represent about 5% of the U.S. market. Penetration is around 10% in Europe, and 15% in China. How will EV market share evolve?
Black: We call it EV adoption. Our numbers are a bit different: We estimate that EV market share is 4% in the U.S. and 16% in Europe, with China in the lead, at 17%. It just feels like it's a better product. You charge your car at night like you charge your phone. EVs' cost per mile is a lot cheaper than internal combustion engines, and is getting cheaper as gas prices soar. And, as the technology gets more sophisticated, EVs will drive themselves.
We are bullish on Tesla because it is the market leader. Tesla has about a 20% share of the global EV market. As the TAM [total addressable market] expands for Tesla—as the company launches its Cybertruck pickup, an under-$30,000 EV, cheaper versions of its best-selling Model Y—we think it can hold its EV market share. The TAM for EVs is growing by about 50% a year. Competition is coming for Tesla, but even if the company just holds its EV market share, it will keep growing by about 50% a year.
What are the key constraints to faster EV adoption?
Black: Tesla has to build a new manufacturing plant or two every couple of years. It just opened a plant in Berlin that has the capacity to manufacture 500,000 vehicles. The Austin, Texas, plant has the same capacity.
Both plants are in the process of expanding their initial capacity.
[Tesla Shanghai announced this past week that it will open a second factory with a 450,000-unit capacity.]
What is your price target for Tesla?
Black: Our target is $1,600 a share. We estimate total global SAAR [seasonally adjusted annual rate of auto sales] of 80 million vehicles a year by 2026. We estimate EV adoption at 36% by 2026, and assume that Tesla will retain 20% of the EV market.
That means Tesla will deliver about 6.2 million [vehicles] by 2026, versus 936,000 last year. We assume the average selling price stays about where it is, and the company's auto gross margin will grow to about 31.5% from 29% in 2022. We estimate that Tesla will earn about $55 a share in 2026.
We assume the stock will trade for about 45 times earnings, versus 75 times earnings today. That gives us a price of about $2,475. Discounting that back at a 12% cost of equity gets us to a $1,600 price target today.
Do you see any risk in the CEO spending more of his time on a company called Twitter [TWTR]?
Black: Elon Musk can handle many projects. He's also founder and CEO of SpaceX, and founder of The Boring Co. I am not a fan of the distraction caused by his pursuit of Twitter, but he's not using Tesla's capital to do so. If he acquires Twitter, he could easily install another CEO to run it. [Musk subsequently agreed to buy Twitter for $44 billion.]
Pierre, you're also a Tesla fan. Explain your bullish view.
Ferragu: Electrification is a dynamic system in which the more adoption you get, the more possibilities there are for people to buy new cars. At this point, demand for Teslas has vastly exceeded existing capacity. I am focused on supply growth. Today, Tesla has to increase prices almost every month to rein in demand and try to get away from a nine-to-12-month lead time. The company is rapidly increasing the cost efficiency of its manufacturing operation, and the cost of assembling a car is falling fast. The only constraint over the next five to 10 years will be manufacturing capacity.
If Tesla maintains the current pace of growth in its production capacity, it should be in a position to sell about 20 million units in 2030, versus barely one million last year. Between now and 2030, Tesla has what it takes to get there. Then there's the question of how fast other auto companies can ramp up their EV production. Recently, we heard from the CEO of Rivian Automotive [RIVN] that it is going to be tough. The battery market is competitive, and it is difficult to get the supply chain lined up. It is going to be a fascinating decade.
In the meantime, Tesla is leading the charge on the three most important fronts, which are on the demand side. Their cars are the most appealing; they have the best charging network, and the best visibility. On the technology front, Tesla innovates at an unheard-of rate. Tesla retooled its pilot battery-manufacturing line seven times in two years, which means almost once a quarter. The average manufacturer would do that every two to three years. Tesla is innovating eight to 12 times faster than anyone else in the world in terms of manufacturing.
The last aspect is that Tesla is accumulating scale. Even if some other companies manage to move faster in the early stages of EV development over the next few years, Tesla will still have a significant advantage related to its expenses and scale.
What is your Tesla price target?
Ferragu: My price target is $1,580. Between now and the end of the decade, Tesla will be a hypergrowth business. It can grow its cash flow by 30% a year. I arrive at my price target by applying a multiple of 75 times forward earnings, and I expect earnings that are 30% to 50% above the consensus in the next couple of years.
What happens once Tesla can make two million cars a year, but sell only 1.7 million? Also, unlike Apple, the company manufactures its own products. Is that an advantage, or a risk?
Ferragu: On the first question, I don't have a strong conviction that will happen over the next eight years. Tesla has an immediate addressable market today of less than 10 million units, limited by the number of people who can afford a car that costs nearly $40,000, or more. But it has already demonstrated that its effective addressable market is 2 ½ times that, because for every two drivers coming from this premium market, Tesla attracts three from the non-premium market who are trading up to Tesla.
There is so much pent-up demand coming from that trade-up. Tesla will need two to three years to meet that demand with cars at today's price points, and will continue to generate 30% gross margins. In three years, Tesla will have a car priced at $25,000, which will extend its addressable market to more than 50 million units per year. I don't know when the company becomes demand-constrained.
As for the comparison with Apple, the companies are more similar than you might think. Apple doesn't manufacture its own products—it has a symbiotic relationship with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing [TSM] and Foxconn Technology [2354.Taiwan]—but it controls the product end to end, from the hardware to the software, service fees, and platform. That is also the Tesla model. Apple came into a world in which contract manufacturing was already mature. It didn't exist in the same way in the car-manufacturing industry. Apple had the possibility to leverage a flexible, efficient, third-party manufacturing system, and Tesla didn't.
Before this becomes the Tesla roundtable, where do the rest of you see investment opportunities?
Jolly: We foresee 35% EV penetration [of new car sales] in the U.S. by 2030. There are 17 million new cars sold in the U.S. in a normalized year, but there are almost 300 million vehicles on the road already. We focus on the companies that service and repair those cars. The average age of vehicles on the road today is 12 years. We like companies such as Genuine Parts [GPC] and O'Reilly Automotive [ORLY]. They generate over $1.5 billion in free cash flow per year from the distribution of aftermarket parts.
We also like Monro [MNRO], which has 50% exposure to tires. Lastly, Universal Technical Institute [UTI] trains technicians; automotive is a big part of their business. The industry is going to need technicians, especially as Tesla's Model S and Model Y come off warranty.
How will greater EV adoption impact traditional service providers, such as Genuine Parts and O'Reilly?
Jolly: We estimate that EVs will account for about 2% of the U.S. aftermarket, or vehicles more than six years old, by 2030. Those vehicles will require about 30% less work than traditional vehicles. EV adoption will be a small drag on aftermarket outfits like Genuine Parts and O'Reilly in the next few years, crimping demand by about 60 basis points [six-tenths of a percentage point] through 2030. The big four aftermarket distributors can double their market share in a bull case, going from 40% to 80%, as they have significant ability to invest in the future.
Ganguly: From our standpoint as a tire company, electrification is a tremendous opportunity. EVs demand very different performance characteristics. We also recognize the need to manage the duality in the near term—namely, the different types of vehicles coexisting in the marketplace. And, we see an opportunity in infrastructure, both in the software used in EV chargers and in putting chargers in the right places. We are investing in companies that make charging easier for end-users, whether consumers or fleets. We're studying the vehicle-to-grid intersection, and the potential for vehicles to return energy to the grid. These and other areas allow for new software-development opportunities. There are also hardware opportunities in the charging-station infrastructure.
Which start-ups in these areas should investors keep an eye on?
Ganguly: Revel is a Brooklyn, N.Y.–based EV-only ride-share company in our portfolio. It has installed its own charging infrastructure in Brooklyn, and is building it out in other places to support its fleet operations, which include 100% electric cars and electric mopeds. And, it has opened up the charging infrastructure to third parties.
We have also invested in AmpUp, which makes charging more convenient for users, fleets, and facilities managers. AmpUp's software allows for choice and control. For drivers, AmpUp offers a dedicated mobile app to locate chargers and schedule charging. For charging-station owners, it helps control who receives access to charging, provides analytics, and optimizes energy usage. For fleets and utilities, AmpUp can provide energy controls to deliver higher uptime.
These are two examples of companies facilitating the software/hardware combination required for EV charging to work broadly.
What is the revenue opportunity, or total addressable market, for EV connectivity?
Ganguly: There's a lot to be done once you put hardware in the ground. There are simple things, like remotely managing hardware and performing diagnostics. We envision a world of SaaS [software as a service] opportunities based on this installed hardware base.
On the connectivity side, we are still in the process of understanding the TAM. The connected car allows for new value propositions. Car components can be connected to the internet to provide better safety and efficiency and predictive maintenance. For example, an intelligent, connected tire can communicate tire health and, in the future, alert road conditions to drivers.
In addition, we are expecting blockchain-enabled smart contracts to help connected cars with unique VIN numbers make payments automatically for tolls, fuel, and such, and also interact with city infrastructure and other cars. Web 3.0 start-ups may also help allow connected cars to display vehicle data in a user-friendly way, and allow users to share data to help get services such as insurance tailored to their driving needs and styles.
We are extremely excited about connectivity—the ability to digitize the contact point of the car to the road, which happens through the tire. If you can do that, you can achieve much greater safety and efficiency.
We're almost an hour into this discussion, and no one has mentioned Ford Motor [F] or General Motors [GM]. They are spending tens of billions of dollars to develop EVs—and catch up to Tesla. What are their prospects?
Black: Ford and GM are going to struggle. Ford's new Mustang Mach-E [an all-electric Mustang] has gotten the most traction, but even then, the company can't produce enough. ICE [internal combustion engine] vehicles still account for 91% of industry sales. Ford and GM have deliberately tried not to cannibalize their base business. That's a mistake.
You have to go after the heart of your business and not be afraid to cannibalize yourself, recognizing that EVs at some point are going to be 100% of the market. We are starting to see that with the introduction of the Ford F-150 Lightning and Porsche Taycan. Traditional car makers will be more successful in the EV world if they bring out EV versions of their best-selling brands, rather than trying to launch new brands with an EV moniker.
Jolly: I might take the other side of that argument, even though I agree with some of Gary's points. GM generates about $150 billion of revenue annually. It has said it will double that revenue by 2030, including $50 billion in Cruise [autonomous] and $90 billion in EV. ICE vehicles will account for 65% of sales through 2030, but traditional auto makers also have dealership networks that provide parts and service. Currently, pure-EV manufacturers don't have this. GM generates significant cash flow, but trades for only a mid-single-digit earnings multiple. From an enterprise-value perspective, once you back out stakes in Cruise, the FinCo [finance company] book, and the net cash on the balance sheet, GE trades for one to two times Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization]. To me, GM's stock could be a great value play.
Black: To continue the Apple analogy, who were the dominant players in mobile phones before the iPhone launched? Nokia [NOK], BlackBerry [BB], Motorola, and Samsung Electronics [005930.Korea]. Three of the four really don't exist anymore as mobile-phone companies. They couldn't compete with Apple. I put the iPhone in the same category as Tesla. From a technology standpoint, Apple didn't stand still. It kept improving the product, and that's what you're seeing with Tesla. I don't see GM and Ford out-innovating Tesla. Unless Ford and GM separate their EV businesses from their ICE businesses and build separate EV companies almost from scratch, they are going to have a hard time gaining traction in EVs in the same way that Motorola, Nokia, and Blackberry failed to gain traction, even though they had a huge head start versus the iPhone.
Ferragu: Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y are very competitive in price against an equivalent ICE Mercedes or BMW. But Tesla has a 30% gross profit margin. It costs a traditional auto maker typically $10,000 to electrify a car. This is an enormous challenge for them. How can they compete with Tesla if it makes electric cars more cheaply than their ICE cars, and they have to spend $10,000 more to make an electric car?
But Carolina is saying something important: You don't want to underestimate the economic momentum of the legacy auto makers. Also, the U.S. auto industry has enormous political support. I expect the industry to survive, but the next 10 to 20 years are going to be extremely challenging. These companies will need financial lifelines from their governments. In some ways, they are too big to fail, or too big to lose significant market share to new entrants.
How do non-U.S. auto makers stack up?
Black: Volkswagen [VOW3.Germany] has been pretty aggressive about going after the EV business. Toyota Motor [TM] is still the world's No. 1 auto maker. It has two best-selling brands: the Camry and RAV4. Toyota has been slow at adapting to the EV world. That could hurt them, so I would put them in the loser's box. The negative argument for Tesla is: Can they produce 10 million units per year by 2030 with only two models? No auto maker has been able to do more than about a mil-lion per year.
Autonomous driving is an alluring concept, but it hasn't yielded much yet in the way of real-world applications. What is the outlook?
Ganguly: We have made a few investments in the autonomous world. We are investors in Starship Technologies, a mobility company whose autonomous robots handle last-mile delivery of groceries and meals; last mile is the most expensive part of delivery. The robots operate on sidewalks, which eliminates many of the regulatory hurdles that come with operating on roads. On-demand ordering and contactless delivery saw explosive growth during the Covid pandemic.
We have also invested in Gatik, an autonomous trucking company working on middle-mile logistics—that is, business-to-business logistics for the retail industry. We are working on connected-tire technology. We see ourselves playing an important role in making autonomy safe and efficient. Focusing on point-to-point delivery seems a more solvable problem than full-scale autonomy. Both of these companies allow us to work on a subset of the autonomy problem, but there are people looking at this space through a much wider lens.
Are there attractive public companies in the autonomy arena?
Jolly: Our focus, again, isn't on who is going to win in EVs or autonomous vehicles, but which companies are going to benefit from these trends. Greater penetration of autonomous technology over the next five years means more-advanced sensors and sensor-based parts on vehicles. The addition of this technology means two things: People probably will be able to do less work themselves on their cars, so companies with exposure to repair will do well. Second, those sensors likely will require more frequent recalibration, so cars will go in for repairs more often than in the past.
In addition to Monro, Genuine Parts, and O'Reilly, we like Snap-on [SNA], which sell tools to repair shops. We expect them to make more-valuable tools as autonomous technology penetrates the market. We also like Copart [CPRT], which auctions salvaged vehicles.
As the market transitions to autonomous vehicles, new technologies, especially sensor-based tech, are driving up the cost and value of repair. Increasingly, it is more expensive for insurance companies to pay for the repair of these vehicles than it is to scrap and auction them out. This creates an opportunity for Copart.
Pierre, what are your thoughts on the future of autonomy?
Ferragu: We are making good progress on autonomous cars driving safely, but the real challenge is mission delivery: making sure the car does the job in finding the person to pick up and figuring out where to drop her off, for instance. Autonomous technology needs the right environments to flourish, meaning an existing infrastructure, with an existing fleet of human drivers already delivering a service, into which we'll be able to progressively introduce driverless vehicles.
When it comes to assisted driving—a car driving by itself but with the driver still behind the wheel, ready to take over and able to supervise—we are particularly bullish on Tesla. They have the best technology. For driverless services, we are bullish on ride-sharing leaders such as Uber Technologies [UBER], Grab Holdings [GRAB], and DiDi Global [DIDI], which are best positioned to introduce driverless vehicles in their fleets. We are more prudent on players like Waymo [a subsidiary of Alphabet (GOOGL)] and Cruise, which are trying to develop driverless fleets by themselves.
Black: Pierre, how much of your $1,580 Tesla price target reflects autonomy?
Ferragu: None of it. For now, I am forecasting 30% gross profit margins for Tesla, in line with their current performance. In the long run, autonomous might contribute to that level of profitability, or add to it. It will depend on how unique their technology is.
Black: We put no valuation on Tesla's autonomy offerings, either. Every innovation you've seen in the automobile in the past 60 years, whether automatic transmission, anti-lock brakes, or turbo-charging, has been copied by all companies. It is hard to say that any one company will gain significant market share.
Right now, the take rate on FSD [full self-driving] at Tesla is under 10% globally, and about 15% in the U.S. People will say that's because it doesn't work yet; it's only a Level 2 system [partial automation]. But even once Tesla gets to Level 4 or Level 5, other companies will reach the same point.
Practically speaking, how will autonomous driving roll out over the next few years?
Black: Elon has been promising it will be this year for at least five or six years, and we're still not there. First, we are several years away from the point where regulators will approve autonomous vehicles that don't require you to sit in the driver's seat and keep both hands on the wheel. Second, everybody in the industry is working on this.
Tesla believes in what it calls a generalized solution, meaning FSD beta features have all been perfected. Tesla can push a button and FSD will work everywhere. Other companies are using more of a geofenced framework, whereby they master one market and then roll it out to additional markets. It is hard to see how this scales quickly, so I struggle with it from an investment standpoint. More important, regulators aren't going to favor one company over another; they are going to try to give everybody an equal playing field. Hence, it is hard to value.
Ganguly: We are watching point-to-point applications, and expect those problems to be solved earlier than some of the broader, more challenging problems the AV industry is pursuing. We expect to see a lot happen on the sidewalk, including autonomous delivery of goods. We are also working with and watching robo-taxi-type applications. We see autonomy happening first in segments where safety can be assured more quickly.
Pierre mentioned Uber. Do the rest of you have favorites in the ride-sharing industry?
Ferragu: In ride-sharing and delivery, we see a strong network effect. It is a competitive market with no barriers to entry on greenfields. But as competition intensifies, scale becomes critical and only the largest two players survive. We call that natural duopolies, and natural duopolies usually result in very strong economics for the market leader, whereas the No. 2 will have a harder time. We like Uber and Grab, and we would like DiDi as much in a different political setup.
The pinnacle of that world is when you have the No. 1 food-delivery company and No. 1 ride-sharing player combined in one company, and that is the case with Grab. It is No. 1 in five countries in Southeast Asia in both delivery and ride sharing. Uber is No. 1 in about 40% of the world in ride sharing, and has exited other markets. In addition, in most of their markets they are a very strong No. 2—and sometimes even No. 1—in food delivery, as well.
Black: We like Uber, too, for the reasons discussed. Also, it is a reopening play. Uber is selling for less than two times enterprise value to revenue, and will be profitable in 2023. They have formed a duopoly with a lot of pricing discipline. We own Uber in the Future Fund.
Thanks, Gary, and everyone.

 It's Not Just Tesla. 8 Other Stocks to Play the Future of Transportation.

176,6-May-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Musk Secures Fresh $7 Billion From Investors in Twitter Bid,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2659881319/BFD812D457A14912PQ/322?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has assembled a group of investors including a Saudi prince, Larry Ellison and a bitcoin exchange to pony up more than $7 billion to back his bid to buy Twitter Inc.
Tesla Inc.'s chief executive has lined up about $7.14 billion from 19 investors, a roster of big-money backers whose investment effectively reduces the personal risk Mr. Musk has to take to close the $44 billion deal for the social-media company.
The new money will cut in half the amount Mr. Musk needs to borrow against his Tesla stake, according to a regulatory filing, and will slightly reduce the balance of cash he needs to put up personally, to just under $20 billion.
The biggest contribution comes from Prince al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, who agreed to retain a stake in Twitter valued at $1.9 billion following Mr. Musk's takeover, the disclosure said.
The prince, a nephew of King Salman, initially dismissed Mr. Musk's offer, saying it undervalued Twitter. Prince al-Waleed was at his desert camp outside Riyadh Thursday and unavailable to comment, said a spokesperson for his company, Kingdom Holding Co.
Mr. Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle Corp., agreed to put in $1 billion. Cryptocurrency exchange Binance.com, controlled by billionaire developer Changpeng Zhao, promised $500 million. Venture-capital firms Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz are contributing $800 million and $400 million, respectively. Arms of asset managers Fidelity Investments and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. also will take part.
Investors with knowledge of the commitments said they were largely a reflection of Mr. Musk's personal relationships with startup investors, and the billions of dollars his companies have made for shareholders.
DFJ Growth, one of two venture firms that spun out of one of Silicon Valley's oldest venture operations, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, committed $100 million. Both iterations of the firm made investments into Mr. Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp.
Some of the contributions are on the small side for the funds, another sign that the investments are more about Mr. Musk and less a reflection of enthusiasm for Twitter's prospects.
Fidelity Management & Research Co. has longstanding ties with Mr. Musk through its investments in Tesla and SpaceX, which have reaped billions of dollars in profit for the mutual-fund manager. But Fidelity's $316 million commitment is small for the investor, which has funds that manage hundreds of billions of dollars, said an investor with knowledge of the company's strategy. When Fidelity likes a deal, it tends to give an entrepreneur $1 billion, the person said.
The deal is an unusual one, particularly for the venture-capital firms, which tend to invest in young companies before an IPO. Twitter was founded in 2006 and went public nine years ago.
Absent from the investor list are many of the big private equity and buyout funds often seen in these types of take-private deals, investors said. Getting involved in Twitter brings some political risk, the people said, which may have dampened investor interest.
A big exception is Brookfield, which is putting $250 million into the deal via Brookfield Growth, according to a person familiar with the matter, a unit that typically invests in younger companies. The investment is the largest ever for the unit, which participated in the latest funding round for Mr. Musk's Boring Co.
The swath of investors features firms that have put money into the development of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Andreessen Horowitz has invested in Coinbase Global Inc. and Dapper Labs Inc., the maker of the nonfungible-token line NBA Top Shot. DFJ Growth also invested in Coinbase, according to its website. Sequoia has put money in crypto exchange FTX.
Binance said its involvement is ""as a supporter of Elon Musk's plans for Twitter and an investor,"" a spokesman said. Mr. Zhao tweeted that the investment was ""a small contribution to the cause.""
Mr. Musk said he is in talks to bring more current Twitter shareholders, including co-founder Jack Dorsey, into the company after the buyout.
Mr. Musk has told potential investors in Twitter that he could return the company to public markets after a few years of ownership, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. The world's richest man, by some measures, Mr. Musk leveraged a wide network of associates to come on board for his plans.
He has said that he wants the social-media company to be less censorious in content moderation, but has otherwise given few details about his exact plans. At one point he said he doesn't care whether he makes money on the deal. Mr. Musk has a history of missing his timelines and targets at Tesla. Still, in less than two decades, Mr. Musk has grown Tesla from a niche player in the auto industry into the world's most valuable car company.
Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, is betting that Mr. Musk can help Twitter fulfill its founders' mission to ""connect the world,"" co-founder Ben Horowitz tweeted.
Twitter, Mr. Horowitz said, is challenged by ""myriad difficult issues"" -- bots, abuse and censorship among them. Its reliance on advertising exacerbates them, he said. Mr. Musk has suggested he would remove ads from Twitter and turn to a subscription-based business model.
Twitter shares rose 2.7% Thursday to $50.36, edging toward Mr. Musk's $54.20-a-share offer price.
As a result of the new financing commitments, Mr. Musk said the $12.5 billion margin loan he had received to buy Twitter has been reduced to $6.25 billion and the takeover will be financed now by $27.25 billion in equity and cash.
Mr. Musk's heavy borrowing against his shares has weighed on Tesla's stock in recent weeks. The shares closed down more than 8% Thursday.
The reduction in the margin loan will reduce the collateral Mr. Musk will need to pledge. He had committed to a loan-to-value ratio of 20%, which would have called for pledging Tesla shares worth $62.5 billion when seeking to borrow $12.5 billion. Borrowing less means he needs to put down shares worth $31.25 billion.

177,6-May-22,Los Angeles Times,"BUSINESS; Musk adds deep-pocket backers for Twitter bid; Equity pledges total $7.1 billion, making the deal less risky for him and his lenders.",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2659860447/BFD812D457A14912PQ/356?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has secured about $7.1 billion in new financing commitments, including from billionaire Larry Ellison, a Saudi prince and Sequoia Capital, to help fund his proposed $44-billion takeover of Twitter.
The equity commitments from 19 investors come as the Tesla billionaire marshals capital to bankroll one of the biggest tech industry takeovers.
Musk had originally said he planned to fund the deal in part with a $12.5-billion loan against his shares in Tesla Inc., the electric-vehicle company he runs.

The new funding will enable him to reduce by half the size of that margin loan to $6.25 billion, making the deal less risky for both Musk and his lenders. It also slightly reduces the amount of cash Musk needs to put up personally.
CNBC reported that Musk is expected to serve as temporary chief executive of Twitter for a ""few months,"" after he completes the deal.
Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman of the board at Kingdom Holding Co., made the biggest contribution, agreeing to commit almost 35 million shares in Twitter -- worth $1.9 billion -- to retain a stake in the company after Musk's takeover, according to an amended securities filing Thursday morning.
Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle Corp. who has a big stake in Tesla and a seat on its board, committed $1 billion through his trust.
Other investors named in the filing Thursday include the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance Holdings Ltd., Brookfield Asset Management, Fidelity Management & Research and Qatar Holding.
Changpeng Zhao, chief executive of Binance, which promised $500 million, tweeted that it was ""a small contribution to the cause.""
With the financing picture becoming clearer, the market seems to be coming around to the idea that the deal will close.
The gap between Twitter's stock price and the $54.20 per share that Musk offered to pay for the company is at its narrowest point since April 26. Twitter shares rose 2.7% to $50.36 on Thursday.
The deal is set to close later this year, and the two sides have each agreed to pay a $1-billion breakup fee if it falls apart.
The world's wealthiest person reached an agreement April 25 to acquire Twitter using a financing plan that has alarmed some Tesla investors.
In addition to pledging tens of billions of dollars' worth of his Tesla shares to support margin loans, Musk vowed to line up some $21 billion of equity.
That number has risen to $27.25 billion, according to Thursday's filing. Musk has sold more than $8.5 billion of Tesla stock to finance the deal.
""In this game of high stakes poker, Ellison and the impressive list of backers will remove more of an overhang from Tesla shares as the Musk leverage of shares now becomes less onerous,"" said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush. ""This was a smart financial and strategic move by Musk that will be well received across the board.""
Musk's latest backers include a bevy of traditional asset managers, venture capital firms, boutique hedge funds and one of the world's largest pools of capital.
Qatar Holding, a unit of the nation's wealth fund, has agreed to commit $375 million.
Alwaleed previously rejected Musk's bid, stating that it failed to come ""close to the intrinsic value of Twitter.""
Musk is also in discussions with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey on contributing some of his shares toward the acquisition.
Ellison, 77, is the richest person in the group besides Musk. The corporate software titan has a net worth of $95.6 billion, placing him 11th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
He's not an active Twitter user -- his only tweet was a decade ago -- but he does share some of Musk's political views. Ellison is a major Republican donor and hosted a fundraiser for former President Trump in 2020.
Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who has publicly feuded with Dorsey on Twitter, has agreed to commit $400 million via his fund Andreessen Horowitz, known as a16z. Fellow venture firm Sequoia Capital is putting up $800 million.
Ben Horowitz, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, cited the work of Twitter founders Evan Williams and Dorsey as a reason the firm invested.
""We believe in EV and Jack's vision to connect the world and we believe in Elon's brilliance to finally make it what it was meant to be,"" Horowitz said.
Several Tesla investors are among those committing support for Musk's Twitter bid, including Ellison, who owns 1.45% of the carmaker's outstanding shares, and Fidelity Management & Research Co., which owns about 1%. Both are among Tesla's biggest investors.
Smaller investors include Witkoff Capital, real estate tycoon Steven Witkoff's firm, and Cartenna Capital, a hedge fund set up by Peter Avellone, a former Millennium Management portfolio manager.
Musk had been building up a stake in Twitter since early this year, eventually amassing more than 9% of the company and becoming its largest individual shareholder.
He was offered a seat on the board, which he turned down because of the restrictions it would have placed on him for buying more shares. Instead, he made a formal offer for Twitter on April 14, subject to financing that wasn't immediately spelled out.
With more than 90 million followers on Twitter, Musk is one of the platform's most prominent and outspoken users.
He is known for sometimes cryptic or mysterious tweets, lobbed at all hours of the day, on topics as diverse as cryptocurrencies, space travel and whether Twitter should have an edit button.
Some of the ideas he has thrown out for Twitter include that it limit advertising, open-source its algorithm and do more to emphasize free-speech principles.

Contrarian Indications
To the Editor: One of the tenets of investing is that past performance is no guarantee of future performance ("" The Stock Market Isn't Falling Like It Did In the 1970s—It's Even Worse ,"" The Trader, April 29).
The media and investor sentiment are overwhelmingly pessimistic. The VIX once again is above 30. Investors continue to liquidate equity funds as Barron's reports average weekly outflows of over $5.3 billion in April. The AAII Sentiment Survey shows bullish sentiment below 20% and the spread between bullish and bearish sentiment at record highs. Bearish sentiment at 59% is the highest since 2009.
When was the last time the consensus forecast turned out to be correct?
As a contrarian, all of this negative sentiment is signaling to me that the market is at or near the lows.

Nest-Egg Wagers
To the Editor: While it's understandable that asset managers would want to increase their profits by encouraging broad adoption of Bitcoin through 401(k) plans, it would be mind-boggling for regulators to permit it ("" Should Bitcoin Be in Your 401(k)? Fidelity Is Making It Possible—for Better or Worse ,"" April 28).
It's no secret that the U.S. has an impending retirement crisis on hand. Financial-services professionals should be focused on how to increase investors' ability to retire and not on encouraging speculation, which is the essence of cryptocurrency.
Most of the recent developments in the 401(k) space are promising. Target-date funds serving as the default investment option, automatic enrollment, automatic escalation, and fee transparency are all positive trends.
More focus on participant education would be another big step forward in preparing folks for retirement.
Conversely, including the ability to make concentrated speculative gambles with one's nest egg is a step in the wrong direction.

A Cloud Winner
To the Editor: This past week's issue was replete with doom and gloom, and for good reason in light of the market's dismal performance in anticipation of aggressive Federal Reserve tightening. But is the market now devoid of opportunity? The answer lies in Eric J. Savitz's insightful column, "" Big Tech Can't Easily Fix the Stock Market's Woes This Time "" (Tech Trader, April 29). He opines, ""Let's shift to some good news. The cloud computing trend isn't just strong—it's getting stronger."" As a small/mid-cap investor, this missive motivated me to discover specific opportunities beyond Amazon.com, Alphabet, and Microsoft.
Step 1: Which industries are most underserved by the investment in digital transformation to the cloud? Step 2: Which pure-play companies are responding to the challenge?
My findings: Of all industries and subindustries within the 11 S&P Sectors, I find none more in a catch-up mode than property and casualty insurance. Its primary function is to assess risk and to successfully execute a multifaceted underwriting process on behalf on an ever-demanding customer base. The industry can no longer wait or afford to maintain legacy systems built in the 1950s.
As for pure-play companies, there are Duck Creek Technologies, Sapiens International, and Guidewire Software. Market caps are $2.1 billion, $1.3 billion, and $6.7 billion, respectively. My personal favorite is Duck Creek, a spinout of Accenture.
Rob Suthe, Bethesda Md.
Workers Must Show Up
To the Editor: There's no question that today's workers increasingly require improved work-life balance ("" What's Really Driving the 'Great Resignation' "" (Other Voices April 29). But threatening to quit, if required to return to the workplace? That's hardly an option for most people and most jobs. Virtually every job in farming, mining, manufacturing, and distribution cannot be performed remotely. Workers must show up, or nothing gets done. I'd say that's true for the overwhelming majority of service jobs, too. I estimate that less that 15% of jobs are sustainably doable remotely.
With respect to our apparent shortage of workers, relative to employer demand for labor, something clearly happened to a lot of people during the pandemic, causing them to leave the labor force. Perhaps many took advantage of unemployment compensation. Still, I know of few working-age adults who can afford to simply quit working. Every time we hear people say this we have to ask: ""And live how? Generate income how?""
Finally, any discussion of employment participation rates has to include the fact that America is ravaged with substance abuse, and we have a significant percentage of our working-age population with criminal-justice-system baggage. Both of these factors are significant in the labor market, having crept up on us over many years.

179,6-May-22,The Washington Post,Musk secures $7 billion in financing for Twitter deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2659825777/BFD812D457A14912PQ/462?accountid=13946,"Two weeks ago, business leaders publicly questioned whether Elon Musk was serious in his bid to take Twitter private. Now, some of the top investors in the world are lining up to backstop his ambitions.
In a regulatory filing Thursday, Musk unveiled a list of backers who collectively plan to finance more than $7 billion of the Twitter deal. The group includes top Silicon Valley investment firms Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital, cryptocurrency exchange Binance, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and the Qatar sovereign wealth fund.
The infusion is a significant validation for Musk, whose pursuit of Twitter was until recently viewed as a quixotic effort to recalibrate the treatment of free speech on the social media platform, and raises the likelihood of the deal being finalized in the coming months, said Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities.
""You have a who's who of Silicon Valley and the investing landscape of America behind Musk,"" Ives told The Washington Post. ""It's not just Musk himself trying to fix Twitter.""
The backing of tech titans such as Larry Ellison, a friend of Musk and a Tesla board member, solidifies the idea that Musk is intent on making Twitter more profitable. This marks a turnaround from last month, when the Tesla chief executive said in an interview at a TED conference that he was not interested in the economics of the transaction and acknowledged the deal might not work out.
The investment eases some of the financial pressure Musk has absorbed in pursuit of the social media platform. The investments mean his margin loan, which allows him to borrow against the value of securities he already owns, has been reduced from $12.5 billion to less than $6.3 billion, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing dated Wednesday.
However, Musk still must come up with $21 billion in cash he does not yet have or publicly spelled out how he will obtain. The bulk of his $268 billion fortune is tied up in his stock holdings, including Tesla, though he recently sold more than $8 billion of his shares in the electric automaker.
If money is no object in Musk's purchase of Twitter, then regulators might be. The Federal Trade Commission is considering a review to determine whether the acquisition runs afoul of antitrust laws, Bloomberg News reported. It is unclear how his other companies might compete against Twitter. The agency declined to comment.
The Twitter focus from Musk has investors worried about his day job at Tesla. Shares of the electric automaker slid more than 8 percent amid a broader market decline Thursday. Twitter stock climbed more than 2 percent.
The Twitter board of directors signed off on the $44 billion deal late last month, giving the richest person in the world command of a highly influential social media platform. The acquisition followed weeks of talking about the necessity of ""free speech,"" as Musk seized on the role of Twitter as the ""de facto town square"" and took umbrage with content moderation efforts he views as an escalation toward censorship.
His posturing on Twitter, even amid his acquisition attempt, is one reason many people doubted his sincerity. Mark Cuban, venture investor and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, wrote in a tweet last month that he thought Musk was toying with the Securities and Exchange Commission. When reached by email Thursday, Cuban said at the time he wrote the tweet, he had no idea whether Musk would go through with the acquisition. Other experts on corporate finance focused on the initial lack of a financing plan when Musk first made the bid.
His positions on free speech and how to police the site have put him relatively at odds with current Twitter leadership, raising questions about how he will steer his changes through and whether they will affect the executive suite.
CNBC, citing unnamed sources, reported Thursday that Musk is expected to step in as temporary chief executive after he completes the takeover. The current chief executive, Parag Agrawal replaced Jack Dorsey in November. Twitter declined to comment.
To steer this ship, Musk may lean on the expertise of his new backers. Ellison, who committed $1 billion, was one of the founders of business software company Oracle in the 1970s and grew it into one of the biggest technology firms in the world. In the past decade, Ellison gave up the chief executive role, purchased the Hawaiian island of Lanai, and spent more of his time backing an America's Cup sailing team.
Unlike Musk, Ellison is not known for being politically outspoken. But in 2015 and 2016, he donated more than $5 million to two political action committees that supported the campaigns of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), according to donation records on OpenSecrets. A spokeswoman for Oracle did not respond to a request for comment.



Ben Horowitz, an investor and a founder of Andreessen Horowitz, which contributed $400 million to the new deal, said in a Twitter feed that the venture capital firm believes in ""Elon's brilliance"" to make Twitter ""what it was meant to be.""
""While Twitter has great promise as a public square, it suffers from a myriad of difficult issues ranging from bots to abuse to censorship,"" Horowitz said. ""Being a public company solely reliant on an advertising business model exacerbates all of these.""
He said Musk was ""perhaps the only person in the world"" who could fix these problems. The praise echoes that of conservatives who have championed the bid and characterized Musk as a crusader for free speech, saying he will make the platform ""great again.""
Musk has become one of the leading champions of cryptocurrency, which perhaps explains why Binance plans to invest $500 million toward the Twitter purchase. The largest crypto trading platform in the world contacted Musk after his initial bid, and the billionaire welcomed a discussion on how crypto technology could be harnessed to improve the social media site, according to Patrick Hillman, a Binance spokesman.


Other investors include the Qatar sovereign wealth fund and Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Bin Alsaud, who originally rejected Musk's $54.20 a share offer, saying in a tweet last month that he didn't think it came ""close to the intrinsic value"" of the company. Musk fired back on Twitter, asking the prince to disclose how much of Twitter is owned by Saudi Arabia and for him to spell out the nation's views on ""journalistic freedom of speech."" Alwaleed did not respond to requests for comment.
American intelligence has concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the Saudi government, at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. Now, the prince has agreed to convert his stake in Twitter, worth nearly $2 billion, into a stake in the private company.

180,7-May-22,Barron's (Online),It's Not Just Tesla. 8 Other Stocks to Play the Future of Transportation.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2660406344/BFD812D457A14912PQ/32?accountid=13946,"We once thought the future of transportation meant George Jetson's flying car. Instead, we got Elon Musk's Tesla—the company and the electric car—whose twin successes jolted the global automotive industry and are speeding the (eventual) demise of the internal combustion engine.
One might think, from the stock market or Twitter, that Tesla and electrification are the only things that matter today in the world of transportation. But there's a lot more to the story, including autonomous driving, ride-sharing, robotics, and mobility technology, to name just a few salient trends. Plus, there are 300 million vehicles already on the road in the U.S. alone that still need care and repair.
What does all of this mean for investors? That's the subject of Barron's first-ever transportation roundtable, which explores the outlook for auto makers old and new, and the technologies shaping the industry's future. Our panelist include Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, whose Future Fund Active exchange-traded fund (ticker: FFND) invests in companies capitalizing on ""secular megatrends""; Pierre Ferragu, head of the global technology infrastructure research team at New Street Research; Abhijit Ganguly, managing director of Goodyear Ventures, the venture-capital arm of Goodyear Tire & Rubber (GT); and A. Carolina Jolly, senior research analyst at Gamco Investors (GBL).
Transportation Roundtable Panelists
* Gary Black Managing Partner,The Future Fund
* Pierre Ferragu Global Team Head Technology Infrastructure, New Street Research
* Abhijit Ganguly Managing Director, Goodyear Ventures
* A. Carolina Jolly Senior Research Analyst, Gamco Investors
The roundtable took place in mid-April. An edited version of the discussion follows.
Barron's: Let's start with an overview of this sprawling subject. What are the most important trends in transportation that investors need to follow and understand?
Gary Black: The No. 1 trend is that EV adoption is exploding. Battery-operated EVs were about 6.6% of total industry sales globally last year. We estimate they were 9% in this year's first quarter, and will be about 30% in 2025, rising to 60% by 2030. That is reshaping the competitive landscape, similar to the way Apple [AAPL] reshaped the mobile-phone landscape when it introduced the iPhone in 2007.
The No. 2 trend is autonomy, and it involves two factors: self-driving cars and robo-taxis. An industry will develop around summoning a self-driving car that will take you where you want to go, as you can do today in Phoenix and San Francisco. The global ride-hailing industry today is about $300 billion in revenue, including taxis.
Third, Tesla (TSLA) has developed a direct-to-consumer sales model within the EV industry. It avoids dealerships, and uses social media instead of advertising. That's a big trend that we have to pay attention to.
Fourth, as we take out gas stations and install EV charging stations, a lot of infrastructure will need to be built. Range anxiety is still the No. 1 reason why people don't buy EVs. We need much better infrastructure to enable drivers to go from New York to California without worrying about running out of juice. These are the four big trends we're watching.
Pierre Ferragu: To me, the most important trend is electrification. The first order of transformation is that an oil-consuming, polluting powertrain is being replaced by an electric powertrain, itself a monster evolution of a $2 trillion industry. Then, there is the spin that Tesla is bringing to it. Tesla is revolutionizing this market the way Apple revolutionized the $50 billion mobile-phone market. It is redefining the category and attracting a large number of buyers to a significantly more expensive, higher-value product.
Second, the gig economy and more autonomous mobility are transforming personal transportation. This means delivery eventually can become real-time, and cheap. We will be able to leverage technology to make customer transportation and delivery much more efficient.
A. Carolina Jolly: I want to talk about the vehicles we currently have, and how much we rely on them. I am focused on logistics: housing and servicing these vehicles, and warehousing parts, and how these segments of the auto industry will adapt to trends such as EVs, autonomous vehicles, and shared mobility. The supply chain is also important. As the industry trends toward EVs, how is it going to source components and raw materials? And, how is it going to educate technicians in the future? Many auto companies are being driven by great ideas, but for these ideas to fully penetrate the market, people need to learn to support them.
Abhijit Ganguly: We see three big plays from a corporate venture-capital-deployment standpoint. Robotics is intersecting with mobility, and at that intersection, we find autonomous driving. Advanced driver-assistance systems are improving.
We also see the connected car. More vehicle components are getting smarter, which creates opportunities for the automotive industry to onboard value-added products that improve safety and efficiency.
Then, we see contactless digital technologies that were pulled forward by the Covid pandemic. The convenience these technologies can deliver to end users will become a big deal. In our world, that plays out in a few different ways. Mobile car care is one example: People are choosing to have their cars serviced in their own driveways, at the airport, or elsewhere. Also, companies are starting to use sidewalk robots to deliver groceries, improving the last-mile delivery space.
Last, but not least, sustainability is becoming a big factor in mobility. Sustainability at Goodyear means we balance environmental, social, and financial demands without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. We are stressing sustainability in our Goodyear Ventures investments by enabling electrification, accessibility, driving safety, and less congestion through tire-intelligence collaborations.
EVs represent about 5% of the U.S. market. Penetration is around 10% in Europe, and 15% in China. How will EV market share evolve?
Black: We call it EV adoption. Our numbers are a bit different: We estimate that EV market share is 4% in the U.S. and 16% in Europe, with China in the lead, at 17%. It just feels like it's a better product. You charge your car at night like you charge your phone. EVs' cost per mile is a lot cheaper than internal combustion engines, and is getting cheaper as gas prices soar. And, as the technology gets more sophisticated, EVs will drive themselves.
We are bullish on Tesla because it is the market leader. Tesla has about a 20% share of the global EV market. As the TAM [total addressable market] expands for Tesla—as the company launches its Cybertruck pickup, an under-$30,000 EV, cheaper versions of its best-selling Model Y—we think it can hold its EV market share. The TAM for EVs is growing by about 50% a year. Competition is coming for Tesla, but even if the company just holds its EV market share, it will keep growing by about 50% a year.
What are the key constraints to faster EV adoption?
Black: Tesla has to build a new manufacturing plant or two every couple of years. It just opened a plant in Berlin that has the capacity to manufacture 500,000 vehicles. The Austin, Texas, plant has the same capacity.
Both plants are in the process of expanding their initial capacity.
[Tesla Shanghai announced this past week that it will open a second factory with a 450,000-unit capacity.]
What is your price target for Tesla?
Black: Our target is $1,600 a share. We estimate total global SAAR [seasonally adjusted annual rate of auto sales] of 80 million vehicles a year by 2026. We estimate EV adoption at 36% by 2026, and assume that Tesla will retain 20% of the EV market.
That means Tesla will deliver about 6.2 million [vehicles] by 2026, versus 936,000 last year. We assume the average selling price stays about where it is, and the company's auto gross margin will grow to about 31.5% from 29% in 2022. We estimate that Tesla will earn about $55 a share in 2026.
We assume the stock will trade for about 45 times earnings, versus 75 times earnings today. That gives us a price of about $2,475. Discounting that back at a 12% cost of equity gets us to a $1,600 price target today.
Do you see any risk in the CEO spending more of his time on a company called Twitter [TWTR]?
Black: Elon Musk can handle many projects. He's also founder and CEO of SpaceX, and founder of The Boring Co. I am not a fan of the distraction caused by his pursuit of Twitter, but he's not using Tesla's capital to do so. If he acquires Twitter, he could easily install another CEO to run it. [Musk subsequently agreed to buy Twitter for $44 billion.]
Pierre, you're also a Tesla fan. Explain your bullish view.
Ferragu: Electrification is a dynamic system in which the more adoption you get, the more possibilities there are for people to buy new cars. At this point, demand for Teslas has vastly exceeded existing capacity. I am focused on supply growth. Today, Tesla has to increase prices almost every month to rein in demand and try to get away from a nine-to-12-month lead time. The company is rapidly increasing the cost efficiency of its manufacturing operation, and the cost of assembling a car is falling fast. The only constraint over the next five to 10 years will be manufacturing capacity.
If Tesla maintains the current pace of growth in its production capacity, it should be in a position to sell about 20 million units in 2030, versus barely one million last year. Between now and 2030, Tesla has what it takes to get there. Then there's the question of how fast other auto companies can ramp up their EV production. Recently, we heard from the CEO of Rivian Automotive [RIVN] that it is going to be tough. The battery market is competitive, and it is difficult to get the supply chain lined up. It is going to be a fascinating decade.
In the meantime, Tesla is leading the charge on the three most important fronts, which are on the demand side. Their cars are the most appealing; they have the best charging network, and the best visibility. On the technology front, Tesla innovates at an unheard-of rate. Tesla retooled its pilot battery-manufacturing line seven times in two years, which means almost once a quarter. The average manufacturer would do that every two to three years. Tesla is innovating eight to 12 times faster than anyone else in the world in terms of manufacturing.
The last aspect is that Tesla is accumulating scale. Even if some other companies manage to move faster in the early stages of EV development over the next few years, Tesla will still have a significant advantage related to its expenses and scale.
What is your Tesla price target?
Ferragu: My price target is $1,580. Between now and the end of the decade, Tesla will be a hypergrowth business. It can grow its cash flow by 30% a year. I arrive at my price target by applying a multiple of 75 times forward earnings, and I expect earnings that are 30% to 50% above the consensus in the next couple of years.
What happens once Tesla can make two million cars a year, but sell only 1.7 million? Also, unlike Apple, the company manufactures its own products. Is that an advantage, or a risk?
Ferragu: On the first question, I don't have a strong conviction that will happen over the next eight years. Tesla has an immediate addressable market today of less than 10 million units, limited by the number of people who can afford a car that costs nearly $40,000, or more. But it has already demonstrated that its effective addressable market is 2 ½ times that, because for every two drivers coming from this premium market, Tesla attracts three from the non-premium market who are trading up to Tesla.
There is so much pent-up demand coming from that trade-up. Tesla will need two to three years to meet that demand with cars at today's price points, and will continue to generate 30% gross margins. In three years, Tesla will have a car priced at $25,000, which will extend its addressable market to more than 50 million units per year. I don't know when the company becomes demand-constrained.
As for the comparison with Apple, the companies are more similar than you might think. Apple doesn't manufacture its own products—it has a symbiotic relationship with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing [TSM] and Foxconn Technology [2354.Taiwan]—but it controls the product end to end, from the hardware to the software, service fees, and platform. That is also the Tesla model. Apple came into a world in which contract manufacturing was already mature. It didn't exist in the same way in the car-manufacturing industry. Apple had the possibility to leverage a flexible, efficient, third-party manufacturing system, and Tesla didn't.
Before this becomes the Tesla roundtable, where do the rest of you see investment opportunities?
Jolly: We foresee 35% EV penetration [of new car sales] in the U.S. by 2030. There are 17 million new cars sold in the U.S. in a normalized year, but there are almost 300 million vehicles on the road already. We focus on the companies that service and repair those cars. The average age of vehicles on the road today is 12 years. We like companies such as Genuine Parts [GPC] and O'Reilly Automotive [ORLY]. They generate over $1.5 billion in free cash flow per year from the distribution of aftermarket parts.
We also like Monro [MNRO], which has 50% exposure to tires. Lastly, Universal Technical Institute [UTI] trains technicians; automotive is a big part of their business. The industry is going to need technicians, especially as Tesla's Model S and Model Y come off warranty.
How will greater EV adoption impact traditional service providers, such as Genuine Parts and O'Reilly?
Jolly: We estimate that EVs will account for about 2% of the U.S. aftermarket, or vehicles more than six years old, by 2030. Those vehicles will require about 30% less work than traditional vehicles. EV adoption will be a small drag on aftermarket outfits like Genuine Parts and O'Reilly in the next few years, crimping demand by about 60 basis points [six-tenths of a percentage point] through 2030. The big four aftermarket distributors can double their market share in a bull case, going from 40% to 80%, as they have significant ability to invest in the future.
Ganguly: From our standpoint as a tire company, electrification is a tremendous opportunity. EVs demand very different performance characteristics. We also recognize the need to manage the duality in the near term—namely, the different types of vehicles coexisting in the marketplace. And, we see an opportunity in infrastructure, both in the software used in EV chargers and in putting chargers in the right places. We are investing in companies that make charging easier for end-users, whether consumers or fleets. We're studying the vehicle-to-grid intersection, and the potential for vehicles to return energy to the grid. These and other areas allow for new software-development opportunities. There are also hardware opportunities in the charging-station infrastructure.
Which start-ups in these areas should investors keep an eye on?
Ganguly: Revel is a Brooklyn, N.Y.–based EV-only ride-share company in our portfolio. It has installed its own charging infrastructure in Brooklyn, and is building it out in other places to support its fleet operations, which include 100% electric cars and electric mopeds. And, it has opened up the charging infrastructure to third parties.
We have also invested in AmpUp, which makes charging more convenient for users, fleets, and facilities managers. AmpUp's software allows for choice and control. For drivers, AmpUp offers a dedicated mobile app to locate chargers and schedule charging. For charging-station owners, it helps control who receives access to charging, provides analytics, and optimizes energy usage. For fleets and utilities, AmpUp can provide energy controls to deliver higher uptime.
These are two examples of companies facilitating the software/hardware combination required for EV charging to work broadly.
What is the revenue opportunity, or total addressable market, for EV connectivity?
Ganguly: There's a lot to be done once you put hardware in the ground. There are simple things, like remotely managing hardware and performing diagnostics. We envision a world of SaaS [software as a service] opportunities based on this installed hardware base.
On the connectivity side, we are still in the process of understanding the TAM. The connected car allows for new value propositions. Car components can be connected to the internet to provide better safety and efficiency and predictive maintenance. For example, an intelligent, connected tire can communicate tire health and, in the future, alert road conditions to drivers.
In addition, we are expecting blockchain-enabled smart contracts to help connected cars with unique VIN numbers make payments automatically for tolls, fuel, and such, and also interact with city infrastructure and other cars. Web 3.0 start-ups may also help allow connected cars to display vehicle data in a user-friendly way, and allow users to share data to help get services such as insurance tailored to their driving needs and styles.
We are extremely excited about connectivity—the ability to digitize the contact point of the car to the road, which happens through the tire. If you can do that, you can achieve much greater safety and efficiency.
We're almost an hour into this discussion, and no one has mentioned Ford Motor [F] or General Motors [GM]. They are spending tens of billions of dollars to develop EVs—and catch up to Tesla. What are their prospects?
Black: Ford and GM are going to struggle. Ford's new Mustang Mach-E [an all-electric Mustang] has gotten the most traction, but even then, the company can't produce enough. ICE [internal combustion engine] vehicles still account for 91% of industry sales. Ford and GM have deliberately tried not to cannibalize their base business. That's a mistake.
You have to go after the heart of your business and not be afraid to cannibalize yourself, recognizing that EVs at some point are going to be 100% of the market. We are starting to see that with the introduction of the Ford F-150 Lightning and Porsche Taycan. Traditional car makers will be more successful in the EV world if they bring out EV versions of their best-selling brands, rather than trying to launch new brands with an EV moniker.
Jolly: I might take the other side of that argument, even though I agree with some of Gary's points. GM generates about $150 billion of revenue annually. It has said it will double that revenue by 2030, including $50 billion in Cruise [autonomous] and $90 billion in EV. ICE vehicles will account for 65% of sales through 2030, but traditional auto makers also have dealership networks that provide parts and service. Currently, pure-EV manufacturers don't have this. GM generates significant cash flow, but trades for only a mid-single-digit earnings multiple. From an enterprise-value perspective, once you back out stakes in Cruise, the FinCo [finance company] book, and the net cash on the balance sheet, GE trades for one to two times Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization]. To me, GM's stock could be a great value play.
Black: To continue the Apple analogy, who were the dominant players in mobile phones before the iPhone launched? Nokia [NOK], BlackBerry [BB], Motorola, and Samsung Electronics [005930.Korea]. Three of the four really don't exist anymore as mobile-phone companies. They couldn't compete with Apple. I put the iPhone in the same category as Tesla. From a technology standpoint, Apple didn't stand still. It kept improving the product, and that's what you're seeing with Tesla. I don't see GM and Ford out-innovating Tesla. Unless Ford and GM separate their EV businesses from their ICE businesses and build separate EV companies almost from scratch, they are going to have a hard time gaining traction in EVs in the same way that Motorola, Nokia, and Blackberry failed to gain traction, even though they had a huge head start versus the iPhone.
Ferragu: Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y are very competitive in price against an equivalent ICE Mercedes or BMW. But Tesla has a 30% gross profit margin. It costs a traditional auto maker typically $10,000 to electrify a car. This is an enormous challenge for them. How can they compete with Tesla if it makes electric cars more cheaply than their ICE cars, and they have to spend $10,000 more to make an electric car?
But Carolina is saying something important: You don't want to underestimate the economic momentum of the legacy auto makers. Also, the U.S. auto industry has enormous political support. I expect the industry to survive, but the next 10 to 20 years are going to be extremely challenging. These companies will need financial lifelines from their governments. In some ways, they are too big to fail, or too big to lose significant market share to new entrants.
How do non-U.S. auto makers stack up?
Black: Volkswagen [VOW3.Germany] has been pretty aggressive about going after the EV business. Toyota Motor [TM] is still the world's No. 1 auto maker. It has two best-selling brands: the Camry and RAV4. Toyota has been slow at adapting to the EV world. That could hurt them, so I would put them in the loser's box. The negative argument for Tesla is: Can they produce 10 million units per year by 2030 with only two models? No auto maker has been able to do more than about a mil-lion per year.
Autonomous driving is an alluring concept, but it hasn't yielded much yet in the way of real-world applications. What is the outlook?
Ganguly: We have made a few investments in the autonomous world. We are investors in Starship Technologies, a mobility company whose autonomous robots handle last-mile delivery of groceries and meals; last mile is the most expensive part of delivery. The robots operate on sidewalks, which eliminates many of the regulatory hurdles that come with operating on roads. On-demand ordering and contactless delivery saw explosive growth during the Covid pandemic.
We have also invested in Gatik, an autonomous trucking company working on middle-mile logistics—that is, business-to-business logistics for the retail industry. We are working on connected-tire technology. We see ourselves playing an important role in making autonomy safe and efficient. Focusing on point-to-point delivery seems a more solvable problem than full-scale autonomy. Both of these companies allow us to work on a subset of the autonomy problem, but there are people looking at this space through a much wider lens.
Are there attractive public companies in the autonomy arena?
Jolly: Our focus, again, isn't on who is going to win in EVs or autonomous vehicles, but which companies are going to benefit from these trends. Greater penetration of autonomous technology over the next five years means more-advanced sensors and sensor-based parts on vehicles. The addition of this technology means two things: People probably will be able to do less work themselves on their cars, so companies with exposure to repair will do well. Second, those sensors likely will require more frequent recalibration, so cars will go in for repairs more often than in the past.
In addition to Monro, Genuine Parts, and O'Reilly, we like Snap-on [SNA], which sell tools to repair shops. We expect them to make more-valuable tools as autonomous technology penetrates the market. We also like Copart [CPRT], which auctions salvaged vehicles.
As the market transitions to autonomous vehicles, new technologies, especially sensor-based tech, are driving up the cost and value of repair. Increasingly, it is more expensive for insurance companies to pay for the repair of these vehicles than it is to scrap and auction them out. This creates an opportunity for Copart.
Pierre, what are your thoughts on the future of autonomy?
Ferragu: We are making good progress on autonomous cars driving safely, but the real challenge is mission delivery: making sure the car does the job in finding the person to pick up and figuring out where to drop her off, for instance. Autonomous technology needs the right environments to flourish, meaning an existing infrastructure, with an existing fleet of human drivers already delivering a service, into which we'll be able to progressively introduce driverless vehicles.
When it comes to assisted driving—a car driving by itself but with the driver still behind the wheel, ready to take over and able to supervise—we are particularly bullish on Tesla. They have the best technology. For driverless services, we are bullish on ride-sharing leaders such as Uber Technologies [UBER], Grab Holdings [GRAB], and DiDi Global [DIDI], which are best positioned to introduce driverless vehicles in their fleets. We are more prudent on players like Waymo [a subsidiary of Alphabet (GOOGL)] and Cruise, which are trying to develop driverless fleets by themselves.
Black: Pierre, how much of your $1,580 Tesla price target reflects autonomy?
Ferragu: None of it. For now, I am forecasting 30% gross profit margins for Tesla, in line with their current performance. In the long run, autonomous might contribute to that level of profitability, or add to it. It will depend on how unique their technology is.
Black: We put no valuation on Tesla's autonomy offerings, either. Every innovation you've seen in the automobile in the past 60 years, whether automatic transmission, anti-lock brakes, or turbo-charging, has been copied by all companies. It is hard to say that any one company will gain significant market share.
Right now, the take rate on FSD [full self-driving] at Tesla is under 10% globally, and about 15% in the U.S. People will say that's because it doesn't work yet; it's only a Level 2 system [partial automation]. But even once Tesla gets to Level 4 or Level 5, other companies will reach the same point.
Practically speaking, how will autonomous driving roll out over the next few years?
Black: Elon has been promising it will be this year for at least five or six years, and we're still not there. First, we are several years away from the point where regulators will approve autonomous vehicles that don't require you to sit in the driver's seat and keep both hands on the wheel. Second, everybody in the industry is working on this.
Tesla believes in what it calls a generalized solution, meaning FSD beta features have all been perfected. Tesla can push a button and FSD will work everywhere. Other companies are using more of a geofenced framework, whereby they master one market and then roll it out to additional markets. It is hard to see how this scales quickly, so I struggle with it from an investment standpoint. More important, regulators aren't going to favor one company over another; they are going to try to give everybody an equal playing field. Hence, it is hard to value.
Ganguly: We are watching point-to-point applications, and expect those problems to be solved earlier than some of the broader, more challenging problems the AV industry is pursuing. We expect to see a lot happen on the sidewalk, including autonomous delivery of goods. We are also working with and watching robo-taxi-type applications. We see autonomy happening first in segments where safety can be assured more quickly.
Pierre mentioned Uber. Do the rest of you have favorites in the ride-sharing industry?
Ferragu: In ride-sharing and delivery, we see a strong network effect. It is a competitive market with no barriers to entry on greenfields. But as competition intensifies, scale becomes critical and only the largest two players survive. We call that natural duopolies, and natural duopolies usually result in very strong economics for the market leader, whereas the No. 2 will have a harder time. We like Uber and Grab, and we would like DiDi as much in a different political setup.
The pinnacle of that world is when you have the No. 1 food-delivery company and No. 1 ride-sharing player combined in one company, and that is the case with Grab. It is No. 1 in five countries in Southeast Asia in both delivery and ride sharing. Uber is No. 1 in about 40% of the world in ride sharing, and has exited other markets. In addition, in most of their markets they are a very strong No. 2—and sometimes even No. 1—in food delivery, as well.
Black: We like Uber, too, for the reasons discussed. Also, it is a reopening play. Uber is selling for less than two times enterprise value to revenue, and will be profitable in 2023. They have formed a duopoly with a lot of pricing discipline. We own Uber in the Future Fund.
Thanks, Gary, and everyone.

 It's Not Just Tesla. 8 Other Stocks to Play the Future of Transportation.

181,8-May-22,St. Louis Post - Dispatch,"Nicklaus: As a business, Twitter needs fixing. Can Musk do it?",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2660641489/BFD812D457A14912PQ/540?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has said a lot about making Twitter a free-speech zone, but little about how he'll make it more profitable.
In fact, the world's richest man has said he doesn't care whether he makes money on his $44 billion purchase of the social media site. Other people do care, including banks that are lending Musk money and private equity funds and wealthy individuals who are investing alongside him.
As a business, Twitter needs fixing. It controls a meager 3% of the online advertising market, and it's been criticized for slow user growth and subpar profit margins.
Twitter's stock price was higher at the end of 2013, the year it went public, than it is now. It lost $221 million last year and $1.1 billion the year before that.
Going private, by relieving pressure to meet quarterly earnings targets, can let managers make tough, transformative changes. In Twitter's case, however, Musk is also adding $13 billion in debt.
The company's annual interest bill will be about $1 billion, which is more than last year's cash flow from operations.
""Taking the company private with so much leverage is not going to help it achieve long term success,"" said Armando Gomes, associate professor of finance at Washington University's Olin Business School. ""This is going to make it very difficult to move away from the current business model.""
Twitter gets 90% of its revenue from advertising. Musk has mentioned ways to reduce that dependence, such as charging ""a slight fee"" to corporate and government users.
He also must realize, though, that his vision of Twitter as a freewheeling ""virtual town square"" could alienate advertisers. Big brands may stay away if the site becomes less diligent about policing hate speech, bullying and election lies.
Musk, an avid Twitter user whose tweets have sometimes gotten him in legal trouble, says his main goal is to improve the user experience. He wants to add an edit button, make direct messages more secure and eliminate spambots, which are automated accounts that send out large volumes of tweets.
James Fisher, professor of marketing at St. Louis University, isn't sure that will attract more users. ""There seems to be a contradiction"" between eliminating content moderation and a better user experience, he said. ""When you put a megaphone in everyone's hands, there's so much ugliness that comes out of that.""
Being indifferent to profits is in character for Musk, who famously says he didn't have a business plan when starting PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX and other companies.
""He's kind of a crazy genius, and maybe he's thinking of this as a big experiment on the future of social connections,"" said Perry Drake, an associate marketing professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. ""Maybe it will be socially constructive, or maybe he will kill Twitter.""
It's a bit far-fetched to think a social media site with 229 million daily users might somehow implode, but Gomes does see elements of danger in this deal. Higher interest rates will raise the cost of Twitter's floating-rate debt, and advertising is a cyclical business.
If a recession were to hit, Musk could begin feeling pressure from his bankers. They could even force him to sell the Tesla shares that are collateral for some of his loans.
""This acquisition is creating a significant exposure for Elon Musk to a downturn scenario,"" Gomes said.
Musk can say he doesn't need to make a profit, but if he doesn't turn Twitter around, his new debt will cause him a lot of grief.

182,9-May-22,Barron's (Online),It's Not Just Tesla. 8 Other Stocks to Play the Future of Transportation.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2660777232/BFD812D457A14912PQ/34?accountid=13946,"We once thought the future of transportation meant George Jetson's flying car. Instead, we got Elon Musk's Tesla—the company and the electric car—whose twin successes jolted the global automotive industry and are speeding the (eventual) demise of the internal combustion engine.
One might think, from the stock market or Twitter, that Tesla and electrification are the only things that matter today in the world of transportation. But there's a lot more to the story, including autonomous driving, ride-sharing, robotics, and mobility technology, to name just a few salient trends. Plus, there are 300 million vehicles already on the road in the U.S. alone that still need care and repair.
What does all of this mean for investors? That's the subject of Barron's first-ever transportation roundtable, which explores the outlook for auto makers old and new, and the technologies shaping the industry's future. Our panelist include Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, whose Future Fund Active exchange-traded fund (ticker: FFND) invests in companies capitalizing on ""secular megatrends""; Pierre Ferragu, head of the global technology infrastructure research team at New Street Research; Abhijit Ganguly, managing director of Goodyear Ventures, the venture-capital arm of Goodyear Tire & Rubber (GT); and A. Carolina Jolly, senior research analyst at Gamco Investors (GBL).
Transportation Roundtable Panelists
* Gary Black Managing Partner,The Future Fund
* Pierre Ferragu Global Team Head Technology Infrastructure, New Street Research
* Abhijit Ganguly Managing Director, Goodyear Ventures
* A. Carolina Jolly Senior Research Analyst, Gamco Investors
The roundtable took place in mid-April. An edited version of the discussion follows.
Barron's: Let's start with an overview of this sprawling subject. What are the most important trends in transportation that investors need to follow and understand?
Gary Black: The No. 1 trend is that EV adoption is exploding. Battery-operated EVs were about 6.6% of total industry sales globally last year. We estimate they were 9% in this year's first quarter, and will be about 30% in 2025, rising to 60% by 2030. That is reshaping the competitive landscape, similar to the way Apple [AAPL] reshaped the mobile-phone landscape when it introduced the iPhone in 2007.
The No. 2 trend is autonomy, and it involves two factors: self-driving cars and robo-taxis. An industry will develop around summoning a self-driving car that will take you where you want to go, as you can do today in Phoenix and San Francisco. The global ride-hailing industry today is about $300 billion in revenue, including taxis.
Third, Tesla (TSLA) has developed a direct-to-consumer sales model within the EV industry. It avoids dealerships, and uses social media instead of advertising. That's a big trend that we have to pay attention to.
Fourth, as we take out gas stations and install EV charging stations, a lot of infrastructure will need to be built. Range anxiety is still the No. 1 reason why people don't buy EVs. We need much better infrastructure to enable drivers to go from New York to California without worrying about running out of juice. These are the four big trends we're watching.
Pierre Ferragu: To me, the most important trend is electrification. The first order of transformation is that an oil-consuming, polluting powertrain is being replaced by an electric powertrain, itself a monster evolution of a $2 trillion industry. Then, there is the spin that Tesla is bringing to it. Tesla is revolutionizing this market the way Apple revolutionized the $50 billion mobile-phone market. It is redefining the category and attracting a large number of buyers to a significantly more expensive, higher-value product.
Second, the gig economy and more autonomous mobility are transforming personal transportation. This means delivery eventually can become real-time, and cheap. We will be able to leverage technology to make customer transportation and delivery much more efficient.
A. Carolina Jolly: I want to talk about the vehicles we currently have, and how much we rely on them. I am focused on logistics: housing and servicing these vehicles, and warehousing parts, and how these segments of the auto industry will adapt to trends such as EVs, autonomous vehicles, and shared mobility. The supply chain is also important. As the industry trends toward EVs, how is it going to source components and raw materials? And, how is it going to educate technicians in the future? Many auto companies are being driven by great ideas, but for these ideas to fully penetrate the market, people need to learn to support them.
Abhijit Ganguly: We see three big plays from a corporate venture-capital-deployment standpoint. Robotics is intersecting with mobility, and at that intersection, we find autonomous driving. Advanced driver-assistance systems are improving.
We also see the connected car. More vehicle components are getting smarter, which creates opportunities for the automotive industry to onboard value-added products that improve safety and efficiency.
Then, we see contactless digital technologies that were pulled forward by the Covid pandemic. The convenience these technologies can deliver to end users will become a big deal. In our world, that plays out in a few different ways. Mobile car care is one example: People are choosing to have their cars serviced in their own driveways, at the airport, or elsewhere. Also, companies are starting to use sidewalk robots to deliver groceries, improving the last-mile delivery space.
Last, but not least, sustainability is becoming a big factor in mobility. Sustainability at Goodyear means we balance environmental, social, and financial demands without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. We are stressing sustainability in our Goodyear Ventures investments by enabling electrification, accessibility, driving safety, and less congestion through tire-intelligence collaborations.
EVs represent about 5% of the U.S. market. Penetration is around 10% in Europe, and 15% in China. How will EV market share evolve?
Black: We call it EV adoption. Our numbers are a bit different: We estimate that EV market share is 4% in the U.S. and 16% in Europe, with China in the lead, at 17%. It just feels like it's a better product. You charge your car at night like you charge your phone. EVs' cost per mile is a lot cheaper than internal combustion engines, and is getting cheaper as gas prices soar. And, as the technology gets more sophisticated, EVs will drive themselves.
We are bullish on Tesla because it is the market leader. Tesla has about a 20% share of the global EV market. As the TAM [total addressable market] expands for Tesla—as the company launches its Cybertruck pickup, an under-$30,000 EV, cheaper versions of its best-selling Model Y—we think it can hold its EV market share. The TAM for EVs is growing by about 50% a year. Competition is coming for Tesla, but even if the company just holds its EV market share, it will keep growing by about 50% a year.
What are the key constraints to faster EV adoption?
Black: Tesla has to build a new manufacturing plant or two every couple of years. It just opened a plant in Berlin that has the capacity to manufacture 500,000 vehicles. The Austin, Texas, plant has the same capacity.
Both plants are in the process of expanding their initial capacity.
[Tesla Shanghai announced this past week that it will open a second factory with a 450,000-unit capacity.]
What is your price target for Tesla?
Black: Our target is $1,600 a share. We estimate total global SAAR [seasonally adjusted annual rate of auto sales] of 80 million vehicles a year by 2026. We estimate EV adoption at 36% by 2026, and assume that Tesla will retain 20% of the EV market.
That means Tesla will deliver about 6.2 million [vehicles] by 2026, versus 936,000 last year. We assume the average selling price stays about where it is, and the company's auto gross margin will grow to about 31.5% from 29% in 2022. We estimate that Tesla will earn about $55 a share in 2026.
We assume the stock will trade for about 45 times earnings, versus 75 times earnings today. That gives us a price of about $2,475. Discounting that back at a 12% cost of equity gets us to a $1,600 price target today.
Do you see any risk in the CEO spending more of his time on a company called Twitter [TWTR]?
Black: Elon Musk can handle many projects. He's also founder and CEO of SpaceX, and founder of The Boring Co. I am not a fan of the distraction caused by his pursuit of Twitter, but he's not using Tesla's capital to do so. If he acquires Twitter, he could easily install another CEO to run it. [Musk subsequently agreed to buy Twitter for $44 billion.]
Pierre, you're also a Tesla fan. Explain your bullish view.
Ferragu: Electrification is a dynamic system in which the more adoption you get, the more possibilities there are for people to buy new cars. At this point, demand for Teslas has vastly exceeded existing capacity. I am focused on supply growth. Today, Tesla has to increase prices almost every month to rein in demand and try to get away from a nine-to-12-month lead time. The company is rapidly increasing the cost efficiency of its manufacturing operation, and the cost of assembling a car is falling fast. The only constraint over the next five to 10 years will be manufacturing capacity.
If Tesla maintains the current pace of growth in its production capacity, it should be in a position to sell about 20 million units in 2030, versus barely one million last year. Between now and 2030, Tesla has what it takes to get there. Then there's the question of how fast other auto companies can ramp up their EV production. Recently, we heard from the CEO of Rivian Automotive [RIVN] that it is going to be tough. The battery market is competitive, and it is difficult to get the supply chain lined up. It is going to be a fascinating decade.
In the meantime, Tesla is leading the charge on the three most important fronts, which are on the demand side. Their cars are the most appealing; they have the best charging network, and the best visibility. On the technology front, Tesla innovates at an unheard-of rate. Tesla retooled its pilot battery-manufacturing line seven times in two years, which means almost once a quarter. The average manufacturer would do that every two to three years. Tesla is innovating eight to 12 times faster than anyone else in the world in terms of manufacturing.
The last aspect is that Tesla is accumulating scale. Even if some other companies manage to move faster in the early stages of EV development over the next few years, Tesla will still have a significant advantage related to its expenses and scale.
What is your Tesla price target?
Ferragu: My price target is $1,580. Between now and the end of the decade, Tesla will be a hypergrowth business. It can grow its cash flow by 30% a year. I arrive at my price target by applying a multiple of 75 times forward earnings, and I expect earnings that are 30% to 50% above the consensus in the next couple of years.
What happens once Tesla can make two million cars a year, but sell only 1.7 million? Also, unlike Apple, the company manufactures its own products. Is that an advantage, or a risk?
Ferragu: On the first question, I don't have a strong conviction that will happen over the next eight years. Tesla has an immediate addressable market today of less than 10 million units, limited by the number of people who can afford a car that costs nearly $40,000, or more. But it has already demonstrated that its effective addressable market is 2 ½ times that, because for every two drivers coming from this premium market, Tesla attracts three from the non-premium market who are trading up to Tesla.
There is so much pent-up demand coming from that trade-up. Tesla will need two to three years to meet that demand with cars at today's price points, and will continue to generate 30% gross margins. In three years, Tesla will have a car priced at $25,000, which will extend its addressable market to more than 50 million units per year. I don't know when the company becomes demand-constrained.
As for the comparison with Apple, the companies are more similar than you might think. Apple doesn't manufacture its own products—it has a symbiotic relationship with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing [TSM] and Foxconn Technology [2354.Taiwan]—but it controls the product end to end, from the hardware to the software, service fees, and platform. That is also the Tesla model. Apple came into a world in which contract manufacturing was already mature. It didn't exist in the same way in the car-manufacturing industry. Apple had the possibility to leverage a flexible, efficient, third-party manufacturing system, and Tesla didn't.
Before this becomes the Tesla roundtable, where do the rest of you see investment opportunities?
Jolly: We foresee 35% EV penetration [of new car sales] in the U.S. by 2030. There are 17 million new cars sold in the U.S. in a normalized year, but there are almost 300 million vehicles on the road already. We focus on the companies that service and repair those cars. The average age of vehicles on the road today is 12 years. We like companies such as Genuine Parts [GPC] and O'Reilly Automotive [ORLY]. They generate over $1.5 billion in free cash flow per year from the distribution of aftermarket parts.
We also like Monro [MNRO], which has 50% exposure to tires. Lastly, Universal Technical Institute [UTI] trains technicians; automotive is a big part of their business. The industry is going to need technicians, especially as Tesla's Model S and Model Y come off warranty.
How will greater EV adoption impact traditional service providers, such as Genuine Parts and O'Reilly?
Jolly: We estimate that EVs will account for about 2% of the U.S. aftermarket, or vehicles more than six years old, by 2030. Those vehicles will require about 30% less work than traditional vehicles. EV adoption will be a small drag on aftermarket outfits like Genuine Parts and O'Reilly in the next few years, crimping demand by about 60 basis points [six-tenths of a percentage point] through 2030. The big four aftermarket distributors can double their market share in a bull case, going from 40% to 80%, as they have significant ability to invest in the future.
Ganguly: From our standpoint as a tire company, electrification is a tremendous opportunity. EVs demand very different performance characteristics. We also recognize the need to manage the duality in the near term—namely, the different types of vehicles coexisting in the marketplace. And, we see an opportunity in infrastructure, both in the software used in EV chargers and in putting chargers in the right places. We are investing in companies that make charging easier for end-users, whether consumers or fleets. We're studying the vehicle-to-grid intersection, and the potential for vehicles to return energy to the grid. These and other areas allow for new software-development opportunities. There are also hardware opportunities in the charging-station infrastructure.
Which start-ups in these areas should investors keep an eye on?
Ganguly: Revel is a Brooklyn, N.Y.–based EV-only ride-share company in our portfolio. It has installed its own charging infrastructure in Brooklyn, and is building it out in other places to support its fleet operations, which include 100% electric cars and electric mopeds. And, it has opened up the charging infrastructure to third parties.
We have also invested in AmpUp, which makes charging more convenient for users, fleets, and facilities managers. AmpUp's software allows for choice and control. For drivers, AmpUp offers a dedicated mobile app to locate chargers and schedule charging. For charging-station owners, it helps control who receives access to charging, provides analytics, and optimizes energy usage. For fleets and utilities, AmpUp can provide energy controls to deliver higher uptime.
These are two examples of companies facilitating the software/hardware combination required for EV charging to work broadly.
What is the revenue opportunity, or total addressable market, for EV connectivity?
Ganguly: There's a lot to be done once you put hardware in the ground. There are simple things, like remotely managing hardware and performing diagnostics. We envision a world of SaaS [software as a service] opportunities based on this installed hardware base.
On the connectivity side, we are still in the process of understanding the TAM. The connected car allows for new value propositions. Car components can be connected to the internet to provide better safety and efficiency and predictive maintenance. For example, an intelligent, connected tire can communicate tire health and, in the future, alert road conditions to drivers.
In addition, we are expecting blockchain-enabled smart contracts to help connected cars with unique VIN numbers make payments automatically for tolls, fuel, and such, and also interact with city infrastructure and other cars. Web 3.0 start-ups may also help allow connected cars to display vehicle data in a user-friendly way, and allow users to share data to help get services such as insurance tailored to their driving needs and styles.
We are extremely excited about connectivity—the ability to digitize the contact point of the car to the road, which happens through the tire. If you can do that, you can achieve much greater safety and efficiency.
We're almost an hour into this discussion, and no one has mentioned Ford Motor [F] or General Motors [GM]. They are spending tens of billions of dollars to develop EVs—and catch up to Tesla. What are their prospects?
Black: Ford and GM are going to struggle. Ford's new Mustang Mach-E [an all-electric Mustang] has gotten the most traction, but even then, the company can't produce enough. ICE [internal combustion engine] vehicles still account for 91% of industry sales. Ford and GM have deliberately tried not to cannibalize their base business. That's a mistake.
You have to go after the heart of your business and not be afraid to cannibalize yourself, recognizing that EVs at some point are going to be 100% of the market. We are starting to see that with the introduction of the Ford F-150 Lightning and Porsche Taycan. Traditional car makers will be more successful in the EV world if they bring out EV versions of their best-selling brands, rather than trying to launch new brands with an EV moniker.
Jolly: I might take the other side of that argument, even though I agree with some of Gary's points. GM generates about $150 billion of revenue annually. It has said it will double that revenue by 2030, including $50 billion in Cruise [autonomous] and $90 billion in EV. ICE vehicles will account for 65% of sales through 2030, but traditional auto makers also have dealership networks that provide parts and service. Currently, pure-EV manufacturers don't have this. GM generates significant cash flow, but trades for only a mid-single-digit earnings multiple. From an enterprise-value perspective, once you back out stakes in Cruise, the FinCo [finance company] book, and the net cash on the balance sheet, GE trades for one to two times Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization]. To me, GM's stock could be a great value play.
Black: To continue the Apple analogy, who were the dominant players in mobile phones before the iPhone launched? Nokia [NOK], BlackBerry [BB], Motorola, and Samsung Electronics [005930.Korea]. Three of the four really don't exist anymore as mobile-phone companies. They couldn't compete with Apple. I put the iPhone in the same category as Tesla. From a technology standpoint, Apple didn't stand still. It kept improving the product, and that's what you're seeing with Tesla. I don't see GM and Ford out-innovating Tesla. Unless Ford and GM separate their EV businesses from their ICE businesses and build separate EV companies almost from scratch, they are going to have a hard time gaining traction in EVs in the same way that Motorola, Nokia, and Blackberry failed to gain traction, even though they had a huge head start versus the iPhone.
Ferragu: Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y are very competitive in price against an equivalent ICE Mercedes or BMW. But Tesla has a 30% gross profit margin. It costs a traditional auto maker typically $10,000 to electrify a car. This is an enormous challenge for them. How can they compete with Tesla if it makes electric cars more cheaply than their ICE cars, and they have to spend $10,000 more to make an electric car?
But Carolina is saying something important: You don't want to underestimate the economic momentum of the legacy auto makers. Also, the U.S. auto industry has enormous political support. I expect the industry to survive, but the next 10 to 20 years are going to be extremely challenging. These companies will need financial lifelines from their governments. In some ways, they are too big to fail, or too big to lose significant market share to new entrants.
How do non-U.S. auto makers stack up?
Black: Volkswagen [VOW3.Germany] has been pretty aggressive about going after the EV business. Toyota Motor [TM] is still the world's No. 1 auto maker. It has two best-selling brands: the Camry and RAV4. Toyota has been slow at adapting to the EV world. That could hurt them, so I would put them in the loser's box. The negative argument for Tesla is: Can they produce 10 million units per year by 2030 with only two models? No auto maker has been able to do more than about a mil-lion per year.
Autonomous driving is an alluring concept, but it hasn't yielded much yet in the way of real-world applications. What is the outlook?
Ganguly: We have made a few investments in the autonomous world. We are investors in Starship Technologies, a mobility company whose autonomous robots handle last-mile delivery of groceries and meals; last mile is the most expensive part of delivery. The robots operate on sidewalks, which eliminates many of the regulatory hurdles that come with operating on roads. On-demand ordering and contactless delivery saw explosive growth during the Covid pandemic.
We have also invested in Gatik, an autonomous trucking company working on middle-mile logistics—that is, business-to-business logistics for the retail industry. We are working on connected-tire technology. We see ourselves playing an important role in making autonomy safe and efficient. Focusing on point-to-point delivery seems a more solvable problem than full-scale autonomy. Both of these companies allow us to work on a subset of the autonomy problem, but there are people looking at this space through a much wider lens.
Are there attractive public companies in the autonomy arena?
Jolly: Our focus, again, isn't on who is going to win in EVs or autonomous vehicles, but which companies are going to benefit from these trends. Greater penetration of autonomous technology over the next five years means more-advanced sensors and sensor-based parts on vehicles. The addition of this technology means two things: People probably will be able to do less work themselves on their cars, so companies with exposure to repair will do well. Second, those sensors likely will require more frequent recalibration, so cars will go in for repairs more often than in the past.
In addition to Monro, Genuine Parts, and O'Reilly, we like Snap-on [SNA], which sell tools to repair shops. We expect them to make more-valuable tools as autonomous technology penetrates the market. We also like Copart [CPRT], which auctions salvaged vehicles.
As the market transitions to autonomous vehicles, new technologies, especially sensor-based tech, are driving up the cost and value of repair. Increasingly, it is more expensive for insurance companies to pay for the repair of these vehicles than it is to scrap and auction them out. This creates an opportunity for Copart.
Pierre, what are your thoughts on the future of autonomy?
Ferragu: We are making good progress on autonomous cars driving safely, but the real challenge is mission delivery: making sure the car does the job in finding the person to pick up and figuring out where to drop her off, for instance. Autonomous technology needs the right environments to flourish, meaning an existing infrastructure, with an existing fleet of human drivers already delivering a service, into which we'll be able to progressively introduce driverless vehicles.
When it comes to assisted driving—a car driving by itself but with the driver still behind the wheel, ready to take over and able to supervise—we are particularly bullish on Tesla. They have the best technology. For driverless services, we are bullish on ride-sharing leaders such as Uber Technologies [UBER], Grab Holdings [GRAB], and DiDi Global [DIDI], which are best positioned to introduce driverless vehicles in their fleets. We are more prudent on players like Waymo [a subsidiary of Alphabet (GOOGL)] and Cruise, which are trying to develop driverless fleets by themselves.
Black: Pierre, how much of your $1,580 Tesla price target reflects autonomy?
Ferragu: None of it. For now, I am forecasting 30% gross profit margins for Tesla, in line with their current performance. In the long run, autonomous might contribute to that level of profitability, or add to it. It will depend on how unique their technology is.
Black: We put no valuation on Tesla's autonomy offerings, either. Every innovation you've seen in the automobile in the past 60 years, whether automatic transmission, anti-lock brakes, or turbo-charging, has been copied by all companies. It is hard to say that any one company will gain significant market share.
Right now, the take rate on FSD [full self-driving] at Tesla is under 10% globally, and about 15% in the U.S. People will say that's because it doesn't work yet; it's only a Level 2 system [partial automation]. But even once Tesla gets to Level 4 or Level 5, other companies will reach the same point.
Practically speaking, how will autonomous driving roll out over the next few years?
Black: Elon has been promising it will be this year for at least five or six years, and we're still not there. First, we are several years away from the point where regulators will approve autonomous vehicles that don't require you to sit in the driver's seat and keep both hands on the wheel. Second, everybody in the industry is working on this.
Tesla believes in what it calls a generalized solution, meaning FSD beta features have all been perfected. Tesla can push a button and FSD will work everywhere. Other companies are using more of a geofenced framework, whereby they master one market and then roll it out to additional markets. It is hard to see how this scales quickly, so I struggle with it from an investment standpoint. More important, regulators aren't going to favor one company over another; they are going to try to give everybody an equal playing field. Hence, it is hard to value.
Ganguly: We are watching point-to-point applications, and expect those problems to be solved earlier than some of the broader, more challenging problems the AV industry is pursuing. We expect to see a lot happen on the sidewalk, including autonomous delivery of goods. We are also working with and watching robo-taxi-type applications. We see autonomy happening first in segments where safety can be assured more quickly.
Pierre mentioned Uber. Do the rest of you have favorites in the ride-sharing industry?
Ferragu: In ride-sharing and delivery, we see a strong network effect. It is a competitive market with no barriers to entry on greenfields. But as competition intensifies, scale becomes critical and only the largest two players survive. We call that natural duopolies, and natural duopolies usually result in very strong economics for the market leader, whereas the No. 2 will have a harder time. We like Uber and Grab, and we would like DiDi as much in a different political setup.
The pinnacle of that world is when you have the No. 1 food-delivery company and No. 1 ride-sharing player combined in one company, and that is the case with Grab. It is No. 1 in five countries in Southeast Asia in both delivery and ride sharing. Uber is No. 1 in about 40% of the world in ride sharing, and has exited other markets. In addition, in most of their markets they are a very strong No. 2—and sometimes even No. 1—in food delivery, as well.
Black: We like Uber, too, for the reasons discussed. Also, it is a reopening play. Uber is selling for less than two times enterprise value to revenue, and will be profitable in 2023. They have formed a duopoly with a lot of pricing discipline. We own Uber in the Future Fund.
Thanks, Gary, and everyone.

183,9-May-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),A Short Seller Warns Elon Musk's $44 Billion Twitter Deal Faces 'Significant Risk' of Getting Repriced Lower; Hindenburg Research says Twitter could lose 50% in equity if the world's richest person walks away from the deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2661172509/BFD812D457A14912PQ/588?accountid=13946,"A prominent short seller said Elon Musk's proposal to buy Twitter Inc. for $44 billion is overpriced and that there is ""significant risk"" that the deal could get repriced lower.
Mr. Musk has offered to buy Twitter at $54.20 a share and take the social-media company private with the intent to return to the public markets again after a few years. He recently lined up $7 billion in financing to help close the sale.
Hindenburg Research LLC, an activist short seller, said Mr. Musk's proposal to buy Twitter has artificially inflated the company's stock price.
 PHOTOS: How Elon Musk Made the Fortune He'll Need to Buy Twitter 
Multiple developments have occurred in recent weeks that makes the firm think Mr. Musk's proposed purchase price of the company could decline from his original offer. This includes Twitter's stock outperforming the broader market, the company's recently disclosed quarterly results and the risk of Mr. Musk walking away from the deal, the firm says.
Hindenburg said in its report that it is currently shorting Twitter, but didn't disclose the size of its position. Short sellers borrow shares and sell them, with a plan to repurchase them at lower prices and pocket the difference.
The firm didn't respond to a request for comment.
""As a result of these developments, we believe that if Elon Musk's bid for Twitter disappeared tomorrow, Twitter's equity would fall by 50% from current levels,"" Hindenburg Research said in a research note published Monday. ""Consequently, we see a significant risk that the deal gets repriced lower.""
Twitter declined to comment. Shares fell 3.7% on Monday, closing at $47.96.
""Interesting. Don't forget to look on the bright side of life sometimes!"" Mr. Musk said in a tweet responding to the note from Hindenburg Research. Mr. Musk, the world's richest person and chief executive of electric-car maker Tesla Inc., has been known to publicly lash out against short sellers betting against him and his companies .
Hindenburg Research, which has targeted electric-vehicle company Nikola Corp. and other companies , noted that Twitter has recently outperformed the Nasdaq Composite since Mr. Musk revealed his position in the company, implying that the stock price could fall significantly if Mr. Musk walks away from the deal.
Also, Twitter recently reported disappointing quarterly earnings and disclosed it overstated its users , suggesting the company's share price would fall further if Mr. Musk's acquisition falls through, the investment-research firm said.
Mr. Musk has also indicated that he would sell his stake in Twitter if his offer to buy the company isn't accepted, another risk for the company's value if the sale falls apart, Hindenburg Research said. Mr. Musk holds a 9.2% stake in Twitter and is the company's largest individual shareholder.
Mr. Musk holds an advantage at this point, Hindenburg Research said, adding that Twitter's board will be under pressure to accept a lower offer for the company.
""In our view, Musk holds all the cards here,"" Hindenburg Research said. ""The board quickly agreed to the deal when conditions were vastly more favorable. We think they'd make the right decision again when faced with the present reality.""

 A Short Seller Warns Elon Musk's $44 Billion Twitter Deal Faces 'Significant Risk' of Getting Repriced Lower

184,10-May-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk Says His Twitter Plans Align With EU's New Social-Media Rules; Tech entrepreneur has emphasized free speech, leading to speculation he might relax content moderation on the social-media platform",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2661266769/BFD812D457A14912PQ/386?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk said his plans for Twitter Inc. are aligned with new European Union rules aimed at compelling social-media companies to do more to police illegal content, after his initial vision for the platform raised concerns among regulators in Europe.
Mr. Musk made the comments in a video posted Monday to the Twitter account of Europe's commissioner for the internal market, Thierry Breton. Mr. Breton met Mr. Musk during a visit to Austin, Texas, where the two discussed the EU's new Digital Services Act, or DSA, which lawmakers agreed to last month .
""I think we're very much of the same mind,"" Mr. Musk said in the video, in which he is standing with Mr. Breton. ""Anything that my companies can do that would be beneficial to Europe, we want to do that.""
The new rules, which aren't yet in effect, would require major social-media platforms to swiftly address illegal content and conduct regular risk assessments, among other measures, or face hefty fines.
Mr. Musk, the chief executive of Austin-based Tesla Inc. whose $44 billion bid to buy Twitter was accepted last month, has previously said that he views the company as an important platform for free speech, leading to speculation that he intends to relax Twitter's content moderation rules. Mr. Musk has said Twitter should be more cautious about removing content and permanently banning users, but hasn't given precise details on how the company's policies could change .

Twitter declined to comment. Mr. Musk didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. He wrote on Twitter on Monday that his preference is ""to hew close to the laws of countries"" in which the company operates. ""If the citizens want something banned, then pass a law to do so, otherwise it should be allowed.""
The exchange with Mr. Breton came two weeks after the EU official cautioned on social media and in interviews that a Twitter under Mr. Musk's ownership would need to comply with the bloc's new rules . ""They can do whatever they want outside of Europe,"" Mr. Breton said at the time. ""But in Europe they will just have to fulfill rules and obligations which are very clear now.""
In the video Monday, Mr. Breton said he was ""happy to be able to explain"" the DSA to Mr. Musk. He said he thinks Mr. Musk understands the new rules well.
After Mr. Breton posted the video to Twitter, Mr. Musk responded, saying: ""Great meeting! We are very much on the same page.""
Mr. Musk, at times, has had an adversarial relationship with U.S. regulators . For instance, he has criticized the Securities and Exchange Commission and has been seeking to overturn a settlement he agreed with the SEC in 2018. Mr. Musk also has made fun of the Federal Aviation Administration after it criticized Space Exploration Technologies Corp., the space launch company known as SpaceX that he runs, for launching a rocket without all the required paperwork.
In China, where Tesla has a large car factory, he has struck a more conciliatory tone . Tesla issued a humbling apology last year after a driver at an auto show publicly blamed Tesla brakes for an accident, after which China's top legal-affairs agency chimed in, calling the company arrogant.

185,11-May-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Says Tesla Sales Are Growing Faster Than the Model T,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2661967333/BFD812D457A14912PQ/85?accountid=13946,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk said his company will be expanding its Shanghai factory and said Tesla was scaling production of a large, complex product faster than any manufacturer ever.
Musk covered a lot of ground during an 80-minute talk at the
Financial Times ""Future of the Car"" conference. Here are the main topics he discussed:
Faster Than Henry Ford
""Our growth rates are faster than any large manufacture production in the history of the earth,"" said Musk ""We're faster than the Model T.""
Faster than the Model T is an impressive boast. But Tesla (ticker: TSLA) seems to be on track. Since Tesla started delivering the Model S in 2012 the company will deliver roughly 3.8 million vehicles, including expected 2022 delivers of about 1.4 million. Ford's Model T had cumulative sales of about 3.2 million units over the same span.
These days, manufacturing scale always comes up with Tesla (ticker: TSLA). Investors and analysts want to know how long the company can maintain 50%-plus unit growth rates into the future.
Fifty-percent is the company's rough guide for investors. Deliveries have grown at about 65% a year on average for the past five years. Deliveries are expected to grow at about 56% in 2022.
China
""We will be expanding our Shanghai factory,"" said Musk.
China is an important market for Tesla and every other auto maker. China is the world's largest market for new cars and electric vehicles. Musk believes that China will account for 25% or 30% of Tesla's total business in the long run.
China is also where he sees the stiffest EV competition coming from. ""There's a lot of super talented, hard working people in China,"" added Musk. ""They won't be just burning the midnight oil, they will be burning the 3 a.m. oil.""
Self Driving Cars
""We are actually quite close to achieving self driving at a safety level that is better than human,"" Musk said. ""Best guess, we will get there this year.""
He's said that before, of course. Even Tesla bulls are split on the company's autonomous driving opportunity. Future Fund Active ETF (FFND) co-founder Gary Black attributes nothing for self-driving in his $1,600 price target for Tesla Stock. ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood believes Tesla's full self-driving technology will be generating roughly $150 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, by the middle of this decade. That very bullish view underpins her very bullish $4,600 target price for Tesla. That is Wood's target for 2026.
Manufacturing
""I've said many times prototypes are easy. Production is hard.""
Musk has said that many time, but he added a few interesting numbers. He says a car prototype takes 100 people and six months. To bring that prototype to production takes Tesla 10,000 people and, at least, 2 years.
Tesla stock closed up 1.6% at $800.04 a share. The S&P 500 rose 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 0.3%.

186,11-May-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk's Belated Disclosure of Twitter Stake Triggers Regulators' Probes; SEC is investigating Tesla CEO for tardy notification after buying 5% of Twitter's stock; FTC has separate probe under way of purchase reporting,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2662086624/BFD812D457A14912PQ/146?accountid=13946,"WASHINGTON—Federal regulators are investigating Elon Musk's late disclosure last month of his sizable stake in Twitter Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, a lag that allowed him to buy more stock without alerting other shareholders to his ownership.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing Mr. Musk's tardy submission of a public form that investors must file when they buy more than 5% of a company's shares, the people said. The disclosure functions as an early sign to shareholders and companies that a significant investor could seek to control or influence a company.
The Tesla Inc. chief executive made his filing on April 4, at least 10 days after his stake surpassed the trigger point for disclosure. Mr. Musk hasn't publicly explained why he didn't file in a timely manner.
 PHOTOS: How Elon Musk Made the Fortune He'll Need to Buy Twitter 
The SEC investigation hasn't been previously reported. An SEC spokesman declined to comment. An attorney for Mr. Musk didn't respond to a message Wednesday seeking comment.
Mr. Musk likely saved more than $143 million by not reporting that his trades had crossed the 5% threshold, said Daniel Taylor, a University of Pennsylvania accounting professor, since the share price could have been higher had the market known of the billionaire's growing stake.
Investors who cross that line are required to file a form with the SEC revealing their stake within 10 days. Mr. Musk's holdings topped 5% on March 14, securities filings show, meaning he should have disclosed his stake by March 24 under SEC rules.
After March 24, Mr. Musk purchased roughly $513 million of stock at prices between $38.20 and $40.31 a share, according to a regulatory filing. The total buying spree made him Twitter's largest individual shareholder with 9.2% of its shares.
Based on Twitter's closing price of $49.97 on April 4, the day Mr. Musk disclosed his stake, he likely saved more than $143 million on those trades, Dr. Taylor estimated.
""The case is easy. It's straightforward. But whether they're going to pick that battle with Elon is another question,"" said Dr. Taylor, referring to the prospect of a regulatory lawsuit against the outspoken entrepreneur.
The SEC could drop its investigation without bringing civil claims, as not every probe results in formal action. An SEC lawsuit against Mr. Musk would be unlikely to derail the Twitter deal because the company's board of directors has endorsed it and the SEC generally lacks the power to stop mergers or take-private transactions, said Jill E. Fisch, a securities and corporate law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.
Regulators could seek a court order preventing Mr. Musk from voting shares he acquired without proper disclosure, but the SEC generally hasn't pursued that remedy, Ms. Fisch said.
On his initial form disclosing his Twitter share purchases, Mr. Musk said he was a passive shareholder, meaning he didn't plan to take over Twitter or influence its management or business. The following day, he submitted another form that showed deeper involvement with the company, including an April 4 offer to join its board of directors .
Mr. Musk offered a week later to buy Twitter for $44 billion . The deal is scheduled to close later this year and must be approved by Twitter stockholders . SEC investigators, who have sought documents from Twitter, are probing whether Mr. Musk's initial disclosure should have revealed more about his plans for the investment, the people said.
Mr. Musk is a prolific user of Twitter who says the platform is languishing under a corporate approach to content moderation that censors some users . ""I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,"" he tweeted on April 25.
He also has a long history of feuding with the SEC, an agency that sued him in September 2018 over allegedly fraudulent statements he made on Twitter about having obtained funding to take Tesla private. Mr. Musk settled the case by paying a $20 million fine, giving up his role as Tesla's chairman, and agreeing to have certain tweets about Tesla precleared by the company's lawyers.
Recently, Mr. Musk has denied lying in 2018 about taking Tesla private and said he felt pressured to settle the SEC investigation. A federal judge last month denied his petition to scrap the deal and dump the policy of having his tweets monitored by lawyers.
Separately, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating whether Mr. Musk violated a law that requires companies and people to report certain large transactions to antitrust-enforcement agencies, according to a person familiar with the matter. After making the filing, an investor generally waits at least 30 days—giving the government time to review the purchase for whether it hurts competition—before buying more shares.
Activist investors are subject to the antitrust filing requirements if their purchases of a company's shares exceed a threshold—generally $92 million—and their existing assets are greater than $20 million. Passive investors who hold less than 10% of a company's shares and don't plan to be involved in governance or steer basic business decisions are exempt from the requirement.
If the FTC alleges violations of the law, it can seek fines of up to $43,792 a day. The FTC investigation was earlier reported by the website The Information.

 Elon Musk's Belated Disclosure of Twitter Stake Triggers Regulators' Probes

187,11-May-22,Philadelphia Daily News,Musk says he’ll reverse Twitter ban on Trump,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2661862404/BFD812D457A14912PQ/636?accountid=13946,"LONDON —Elon Musk, who is offering to buy Twitter, has given his support to a new European Union law aimed at protecting social media users from harmful content after he met with the bloc’s single market chief.
EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton told The AP on Tuesday that he outlined to Musk how the bloc’s online regulations aim to uphold free speech while also making sure whatever is illegal “will be forbidden in the digital space,” which Musk “fully agreed with.”
In a video Breton tweeted late Monday, Musk said the two had a “great discussion“ and that he agrees with the Digital Services Act, which is expected to get final approval later this year. It will make big tech companies like Twitter, Google and Facebook parent Meta police their platforms more strictly for illegal or harmful content like hate speech and disinformation or face billions in fines.
Musk’s plan to buy Twitter for $44 billion has raised fears he would make changes to the platform that would prioritize free speech over online safety — potentially putting him at odds with the looming rules in Europe, which has led a global movement to crack down on the power of tech giants.
The 65-second clip indicates Musk’s and the EU’s views may be closer than they appear. Breton says in the video that he explained the Digital Services Act to Musk in a meeting at Tesla’s Texas headquarters. Musk responds by saying it’s “exactly aligned with my thinking.”
“I agree with everything you said, really,” Musk said. “I think we’re very much of the same mind and, you know, I think anything that my companies can do that can be beneficial to Europe, we want to do that.”
The attempted Twitter acquisition by Musk, a billionaire and self-described free speech absolutist, had raised concerns that he would take a hands-off approach to content moderation.
Breton told AP he explained to Musk that the new law means “we need also to have more moderators, and in the language where we operate. So he fully understood.“
The pair agreed on the importance of being able to inspect algorithms that determine what social media users are being shown, Breton said. — AP"
188,11-May-22,Daily Herald,"No ban on Trump, Musk says Musk: Who else besides Trump returns? -BYLN- By MATT O’BRIEN, KELVIN CHAN and TOM KRISHER AP Business Writers -CLMN-",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2661975170/BFD812D457A14912PQ/680?accountid=13946,"LONDON — Elon Musk said Twitter would reverse its ban of former President Donald Trump if his purchase of the social media company goes through, signaling just how permissive the platform could become toward free speech under his ownership.
Speaking virtually at an auto conference, the Tesla CEO said Tuesday that Twitter’s ban of Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol was a ""morally bad decision"" and ""foolish in the extreme.""
""I think that was a mistake because it alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice,"" said Musk, adding that he preferred temporary suspensions and other narrowly tailored punishments for content that is illegal or otherwise ""destructive to the world.""
Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey voiced his agreement in a Tuesday tweet in which he said ""generally permanent bans are a failure of ours and don’t work.""
Shares of Twitter dropped 1.5% Tuesday to $47.24 per share. That’s 13 percent below the offer of $54.20 per share — or $44 billion — that Musk made on April 14, a reflection of Wall Street’s concerns that the deal could still fall through. Musk emphasized Tuesday that it is ""certainly not a done deal.""
Musk has repeatedly criticized Twitter’s content moderation decisions, including banning Trump for ""incitement of violence,"" but had mostly avoided saying what he would do about Trump’s account. He was pressed for more details Tuesday by Peter Campbell, an automotive correspondent for the Financial Times, which hosted the auto conference.
""If Musk is concerned that many people were upset that Trump was banned, he should see how many more people would be upset if Trump was not banned,"" said Kirsten Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame. ""Musk only appears to be worried about the opinion of a small group of individuals who incite violence or perpetuate hate speech.""
Trump has previously said that he had no intention of rejoining Twitter even if his account was reinstated, telling Fox News last month that he would instead focus on his own platform, Truth Social, which has been mired in problems since its launch earlier this year.
Musk appeared to take those claims at face value, saying Tuesday that Trump will be going to Truth Social along with a ""large part"" of the U.S. political right, creating a situation that’s ""frankly worse than having a single forum where everyone can debate.""
A Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment in response to Musk’s remarks.
While Trump was president, his Twitter persona functioned as a mix of policy announcements, often out of the blue; complaints about the media; disparagement of women, minorities and his perceived enemies; and praise for his supporters, replete with exclamation marks, all-caps, and one-word declarations such as ""Sad!""
In announcing its ban of Trump in 2021, Twitter said his tweets amounted to glorification of violence when read in the context of the Capitol riot and plans circulating online for future armed protests around the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden.
Musk’s remarks Tuesday raise questions about whether those banned besides Trump could also return. The long list of people banned from Twitter includes QAnon loyalists, COVID deniers, neo-Nazis and former reality star Tila Tequila, who was suspended for hate speech.
Other Trump allies kicked off Twitter include Michael Flynn and Sidney Powell, Lin Wood and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was permanently banned in January for repeatedly spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccine safety.
White supremacist David Duke and the often violent Proud Boys organization have been banned, along with far-right trolls like one who goes by the name Baked Alaska, who promoted anti-Semitic tropes and faces charges stemming from his involvement in the Jan. 6 attack.
Alex Jones, the creator of Infowars, was permanently banned in 2018 for abusive behavior.
Twitter, Musk said Tuesday, currently has a strong bias to the left, largely because it is located in San Francisco. This alleged bias prevents it from building trust in the rest of the U.S. and the world, he said: ""It’s far too random and I think Twitter needs to be much more even handed.""
Earlier on Tuesday, Musk said he supported a new European Union law aimed at protecting social media users from harmful content after he met with the bloc’s single market chief."
189,12-May-22,The New York Observer,Elon Musk’s Rosy Outlook On Tesla’s Fate in China May Disappoint Investors,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2663142773/BFD812D457A14912PQ/42?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk says lockdowns that are hampering production at Tesla Shanghai won’t be a significant issue in the coming weeks. Theo Wargo/WireImage
While other tech giants are preparing for a recession-induced business slowdown, Tesla has no shortage of demand for its electric cars; rather, CEO Elon Musk says, the company has a production problem to fulfill its massive backlog of orders, some of which have a wait time longer than 12 months.
At the center of Tesla’s production challenge at the moment is its Gigafactory in Shanghai, China, which, in a normal year, manufactures nearly half of Tesla’s global orders. That powerhouse has faced unprecedented disruptions in recent weeks as a result of China’s stringent Covid-19 lockdown measures.
In April, Giga Shanghai produced just over 10,000 electric vehicles, 81 percent down from the previous month, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association. The plant was closed for 18 days in April to comply with local lockdown orders and was only able to partially operate for the remaining 12 days.
Musk is quite optimistic about getting Giga Shanghai back up and running in full speed soon. In an interview with the Financial Times on May 10, the Tesla CEO said he’d had some conversations with the Chinese government in recent days and concluded that “it’s clear the lockdowns are being lifted rapidly, so I would not expect this to be a significant issue in the coming weeks.”
Will China lift its lockdowns?
The reality, however, may not be as rosy as he thinks. Although Shanghai has reported fewer new Covid cases lately, there is no sign of lockdowns being relaxed. In fact, in many areas of the city, authorities have tightened quarantine measures after Chinese President Xi Jinping doubled down on his controversial “zero-Covid” policy, declaring on national TV last week that anyone who doubts the approach is the enemy of the Chinese Communist Party.
Across Shanghai and its neighboring cities, the vast majority of offices and factories are still shut. Most ports and highways are closed, effectively cutting off logistics—an essential part of a carmaker’s supply chain. Tesla was one of the roughly 600 companies deemed important enough to reopen first. But many of its suppliers are still under lockdown, leaving the company no place to procure raw material and parts.
Tesla was able to operate using parts in inventory for most of April, churning out about 1,000 cars a day. The company had aimed to ramp up output to 2,600 cars a day as soon as next week. But as of this week, daily output has dropped to less than 200, Reuters reported, citing an internal memo.
How low will Tesla stock sink?
It’s estimated more than 30 cities in China were under various degrees of lockdown for all of April, causing a crash in passenger car sales. Tesla’s China sales, which accounted for a quarter of its global business in 2021, dove 98 percent in April from the previous month. It’s not an immediate concern for the company, since it has plenty of back orders to fulfill. However, if lockdown across China continues into the summer, it could eventually put a dent in Tesla’s second-quarter and third-quarter financial results.
Tesla’s share price has already plummeted 30 percent in the past month, largely due to a market-wide selloff. Many investors, including Bill Gates, believe it could fall further. Gates has a $500 million short position on Tesla stock, he confirmed last month.
If Tesla stock falls below a certain level, it could jeopardize Musk’s plan to acquire Twitter. Under his financing plan for the $44 billion deal, he will sell about $21 billion worth of Tesla shares (he has already sold $8.5 billion) and borrow the rest against Tesla shares as collateral."
190,12-May-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",SEC Eyes Musk's Twitter File Lag,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2662325389/BFD812D457A14912PQ/610?accountid=13946,"WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators are investigating Elon Musk's late disclosure last month of his sizable stake in Twitter Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, a lag that allowed him to buy more stock without alerting other shareholders to his ownership.

191,13-May-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk Says His $44 Billion Twitter Deal Is 'On Hold'; Twitter shares fall after tweet; Tesla CEO later says he is still committed to his acquisition of social-media platform,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2663380118/BFD812D457A14912PQ/171?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk said his planned acquisition of Twitter Inc. was ""temporarily on hold"" because of concerns about fake accounts, a surprise twist that jolted investors and raised questions about his willingness to go through with the $44 billion transaction.
Mr. Musk's grenade came in a tweet posted at 5:44 a.m. Eastern Time that was followed just over two hours later by another saying he was ""still committed to acquisition."" Lawyers close to Mr. Musk urged him to send that follow-up tweet, according to people familiar with the matter.
The initial announcement was unorthodox not just in its timing and format, but because Mr. Musk referenced a recent Twitter disclosure about fake and spam accounts that it has made consistently for years—and because Mr. Musk has already signed an agreement for the purchase and waived detailed due diligence on the deal.
The sudden shake-up fueled questions about whether Mr. Musk is committed to a deal that was struck amid a sharp decline in technology stocks that has made Twitter less valuable on paper than it was a month ago when he made his offer of $54.20 a share. Twitter shares, which were already trading well below that level, closed down 9.7% in afternoon trading at $40.70.
People in Twitter's camp said Mr. Musk's first tweet was a surprise and that he hadn't reached out to the company ahead of time. But they played down its significance and said the second tweet, indicating that the deal is still on, is the one that matters. The company continues working to complete the acquisition and is supplying Mr. Musk with all the relevant information under the terms of the contract, according to a person familiar with Twitter's response.
Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal on Friday said ""while I expect the deal to close, we need to be prepared for all scenarios,"" a day after he internally announced a hiring freeze and cost cuts .
Mr. Musk was aware of questions about fake and spam accounts on Twitter when he agreed to the acquisition—he has raised concerns about it in his own tweets for years. In Friday's post on his verified Twitter account, he said: ""Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users.""
He linked to a May 2 report about a Twitter securities filing that said it estimates that false or spam accounts represented fewer than 5% of its daily active users. The company has reported the same figure in its annual reports since it went public in 2013.
It couldn't be determined if the latest tweets were a negotiating tactic to abandon the transaction or reprice the deal.
The tweets come as many big tech stocks have been falling on Wall Street, including shares of Tesla, which retreated 29% since Mr. Musk's investment in Twitter became public. Mr. Musk is using his Tesla holdings to help fund the Twitter deal. Meanwhile, Twitter's stock price had traded below Mr. Musk's offer price as investors wondered if the deal might get reworked or not get done .
Susannah Streeter, an investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said there will be skepticism whether the fake accounts are the real reason for the delaying tactic. ""The $44 billion price tag is huge, and it may be a strategy to row back on the amount he is prepared to pay to acquire the platform,"" she said.
After Hindenburg Research LLC, an activist short seller, this week called the Twitter deal overpriced and said that there is ""significant risk"" it could get repriced lower, Mr. Musk tweeted in response: ""Interesting. Don't forget to look on the bright side of life sometimes!""
If the deal does fall apart , Mr. Musk could owe Twitter $1 billion depending on the reason for the breakup. The size of the breakup fees, at just over 2% of the deal value, is about average for similar transactions. Also called termination fees, the penalties are meant to deter parties from breaking agreements and address the expense and inconvenience of a failed deal.
Because Mr. Musk waived doing detailed due diligence on the deal, it could make it more difficult for him to back out over something like a discrepancy in the number of spam accounts. If he tries to, the company could attempt to force him to complete the deal under a legal protection called ""specific performance,"" though that maneuver is rarely successful in practice.
In 2020, luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE tried to back out of a deal to buy Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 billion after the pandemic hurt demand for high-end jewelry. Tiffany sued to enforce the agreement and LVMH countersued, arguing the business had been so deeply damaged that their original agreement was no longer valid. The two sides later agreed to cut the price by a relatively modest $430 million and settle related litigation.
Mr. Musk's initial tweet Friday could be seen as critical of Twitter, which could further complicate things. The merger agreement stipulates that he can tweet about the deal so long as he doesn't disparage the company or any of its representatives.
Before Friday, Mr. Musk had appeared to be moving forward on the deal in meetings with Twitter and hadn't attempted to restart negotiations, but he had started asking questions about the number of spam accounts on the platform, people familiar with the matter said. A Twitter spokesman said Mr. Musk had visited the company May 6 as part of the transaction-planning process.
Twitter has warned that its estimate of fake and spam accounts is based on a sampling of accounts and that ""the actual number of false or spam accounts could be higher than we have estimated.""
Mr. Musk's tweets Friday are the latest twist in the unorthodox attempt to take over the social-media giant by the world's richest man. It began with Mr. Musk buying a large chunk of Twitter shares on the open market earlier this year as a passive investor, which soon turned into a full-fledged buyout offer, outlined in a four-paragraph letter and several text messages to Twitter's chairman.
The per-share offer price of $54.20 contained a veiled reference to marijuana. The latest bombshell comes on a superstitious date: Friday the 13th.
Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali said he could see a scenario where Mr. Musk tries reducing the offer price by 15% to 20%, to $46 or $43 a share. ""If he's successful, then his ability to secure funding while lowering his reliance on Tesla shares increases pretty dramatically,"" Mr. Squali said.
In addition to financing from Wall Street, Mr. Musk has had to sell at least $8.5 billion worth of Tesla shares to fund the deal. He has also assembled a cast of 19 investors , from a Saudi prince to Silicon Valley stalwarts, to put up another $7 billion.
Meanwhile, federal regulators are investigating Mr. Musk's late disclosure last month of his sizable stake in Twitter, a lag that allowed him to buy more stock without alerting other shareholders to his ownership, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Musk made his filing on April 4, at least 10 days after his stake surpassed the trigger point for disclosure. He hasn't publicly explained why he didn't file in a timely manner. An attorney for Mr. Musk didn't respond to a message seeking comment.
Amid Mr. Musk's takeover attempt, Twitter has been dealing with the disruptions in the digital advertising market from global economic turmoil and the war in Ukraine . The company said Thursday that it was pausing hiring and looking to cut costs and announced the departure of two senior executives.
""Effective this week, we are pausing most hiring and backfills, except for business critical roles,"" Twitter's Mr. Agrawal wrote in a memo, which was viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Twitter's move adds to broader upheaval in the tech industry in recent weeks in which several companies have been cutting staff and spending or slowing hiring.

192,13-May-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Twitter Stock Falls After Elon Musk Says Deal Is 'On Hold'; Shares of Twitter shed almost 10%, hitting the lowest level since early April",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2663430879/BFD812D457A14912PQ/259?accountid=13946,"Shares of Twitter Inc. fell Friday after Elon Musk said his deal to buy the social-media company was ""on hold .""
Shares of Twitter shed $4.36, or 9.7%, to $40.72, its the lowest level since April 1, just before Mr. Musk disclosed a surprise 9% stake in the company. The stock was the worst performer in the S&P 500 on Friday.
Mr. Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc., last month struck a deal to buy Twitter and take it private, capping a topsy-turvy month for the social-media company and its stock, which has fallen 17% so far this month. But on Friday morning, he tweeted, ""Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users."" He linked to a May 2 Reuters report about a recent Twitter securities filing with those statistics.
Twitter shares fell as much as 26% in premarket trading Friday, to $33.51, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
Later Friday morning, Mr. Musk added on Twitter that he was ""still committed"" to the acquisition. That helped Twitter trim its losses.
Still, Twitter's shares are now trading 25% below the deal price of $54.20 a share. Shares of the company had already been falling recently, reflecting investor worries about the outlook for the deal. Like many technology stocks, Twitter has also been hit hard lately by a broad market selloff of riskier assets.
Tesla shares jumped 5.7% Friday.
Tesla shares have slipped since Twitter accepted Mr. Musk's buyout offer. Mr. Musk plans to borrow against his Tesla stake to finance the deal. Tesla investors also worry that owning Twitter could distract Mr. Musk from running Tesla.

 Twitter Stock Falls After Elon Musk Says Deal Is 'On Hold'

193,13-May-22,Barron's (Online),Twitter Stock Plunges as Elon Musk Tweets About Acquisition,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2663380117/BFD812D457A14912PQ/312?accountid=13946,"A tweet from Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent Twitter shares sharply lower. Another sent the stock in the other direction.
The Tesla (ticker: TSLA) CEO said Friday his deal to buy Twitter (TWTR) was ""temporarily on hold"" pending a calculation related to the number of fake accounts on Twitter.
Hours later, Musk tweeted again saying ""Still committed to acquisition.""
Twitter stock was down more than 18% in premarket trading. Following the second tweet, the shares were off 9.2% at $40.96 in late morning trading. That is close to the level Twitter traded at before Musk's initial 9%-plus stake in Twitter was disclosed.
The original tweet was attached to a Reuters article from May 2 about the number of accounts on the social media platform that were bots and spam accounts. Twitter, in its first-quarter financial filing, said that those type of accounts represented less than 5% of what it calls its mDAU, or monetizable daily active usage.
Twitter and Musk didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
Holding the deal because of bots is a little surprising, given that bots aren't a new issue. Musk has said several times that removing spammers and bots are important to increasing Twitter's value . He hit the theme again this week when he spoke at the Financial Times Car of the Future conference.
Twitter ""is the least bad public square, a forum for the exchange of ideas,"" said Musk Tuesday. ""It could be a lot better … in order to be better it needs to really get rid of the bots and the scams, scammers. Anyone trying to create fake influence on the site.""
If fake accounts represent more of Twitter's registered users than he originally believed, Musk may not want to pay his original offer price of $54.20 a share. Future Fund Active ETF (FFND) cofounder Gary Black suggested Friday that Musk might want to renegotiate terms after the latest decline in Tesla stock.
Coming into Friday trading, Tesla stock is down about 36% since Musk's stake in Twitter emerged. The Nasdaq Composite is down about 22% over the same span. It's hard to say exactly how much of the excess decline in Tesla stock, relative to the index, is Twitter-related. Tesla is typically more volatile than the Nasdaq, rising more in good times and falling more in bad times.
Whatever the exact split, the decline in Tesla stock has wiped out about roughly $400 billion in market value since early April. Tesla stock was up 5.5% in Friday trading to $768.
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 2.2% and 1.5%, respectively.
If the deal doesn't happen. Musk might be on the hook for the $1 billion breakup fee which was negotiated as part of the deal. Musk paid about $36.15 a share, on average, for his initial 73 million shares of Twitter. He is still in the black at current levels.

 Twitter Stock Plunges as Elon Musk Tweets About Acquisition

194,13-May-22,Barron's (Online),What's an 'Arb Spread?' Here's How to Calculate It for Elon Musk's Twitter Deal.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2663483363/BFD812D457A14912PQ/544?accountid=13946,"Twitter shares are trading about $13 below Elon Musk's takeout price of $54.20. Investors betting the deal will close can earn a cool 30%—a nice return in a market like this .
On Friday, though, the Tesla CEO put his $44 billion buy on hold , tweeting to his nearly 93 million followers that he wasn't going forward until he knows how Twitter calculated its estimate of bogus accounts.
His declaration raises the question of what the risk is for investors that the deal won't go through. It's called the arbitrage spread, or arb spread, which is the difference between the share price and the acquisition offer—and it's usually expressed as a percentage.
In the case of Twitter ticker: TWTR), for example, the $13 difference between the stock price and Musk's price divided by the stock price implies the market believes there is a roughly 60% probability the deal falls apart.
The math is relatively simple—an expected value calculation. To do the work, you need a normal arb spread, the deal price, and where Twitter shares will go if the deal breaks.
As for a normal spread, a few percentage points seems fair. There are a couple of reasons for that. First, stocks always trade below deal prices until closing. Second, a spread always reflects some risk of a deal not closing since a deal can break for any reason, traders in the know explained to Barron's.
So, if there wasn't much doubt that the deal would break, Twitter shares should be at $51 or $52 each, or $2 or $3 below the deal price. At that stock price, investors would earn 5% when they received their $54.20 in cash from Musk. And if the deal closes in the fourth quarter, about 6 months from now, the annualized return on that $2 or $3 would be 11%. That seems fair for a well financed, call-cash deal.
As for where Twitter will go if the deal falls apart, that's trickier to figure out. The 52-week low is $31.30 and it was trading at $39.31 when Musk disclosed that he already owned 9% of the social media platform. Call it $35 if the worst happens. The stock traded around $36 in premarket trading Friday after Musk's tweet.
So 40% times $51.50—where the stock should be with no deal risk—plus 60% times $35 is just about equal to today's stock price of about $41.
That's the math. There are more sophisticated arbitrage models, but this gives investors an idea of what's going on. The harder bit is figuring out exactly what Musk is thinking.
The better question might be what's the price Musk will renegotiate at. Twitter stock might trade as low as $28 if there is no deal, based on what the Nasdaq has done of late. Investors can plug in the number for a new takeout price to get their own odds.
Coming into Friday trading, Twitter stock had dropped about 12% since the post deal pop sent shares above $50 in early April. Deal fears are a part of that, but so is the overall market. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have declined about 13% and 20%, respectively, over the same period.

Elon Musk said early Friday (May 13) his deal to acquire Twitter was on hold pending details on the number of “fake accounts” on the platform.
“Twit­ter deal tem­porarily on hold pend­ing de­tails sup­port­ing cal­cu­la­tion that spam/fake ac­counts do in­deed rep­re­sent less than 5% of users,” Musk tweeted. Two hours later, Musk added that he is still committed to the deal.

Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of usershttps://t.co/Y2t0QMuuyn
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 13, 2022
Musk’s tweet linked to a Reuters article published on May 2 concerning a Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Twitter revealing that false or spam accounts represented fewer than 5 percent of its monetizable daily active users.
Musk has vowed to delete all fake accounts on Twitter once he owns the platform. It’s a key part of his plan to make Twitter a true platform for free speech and a profitable business. His plan also involves expanding Twitter’s subscription program in order to tap a new revenue stream and reduce its reliance on advertising sales. All these ideas seem to be based on Musk’s understanding of Twitter’s active user number and how many of them are legitimate accounts. His latest tweet suggests that, if the information he has is wrong, it could throw off his calculation.
Twitter currently has 229 million daily active users, and it’s estimated less than 5 percent of those are spam accounts, according to the company’s earnings report for the quarter ended March 31. Twitter didn’t immediately respond to a press inquiry about what information Musk is seeking regarding fake account statistics.
Musk announced his intention to buy Twitter for $44 billion on April 14 after acquiring 9.2 percent of the company’s shares on the public market. Twitter’s board accepted his offer on April 24. Since then, the billionaire has been working to raise cash and secure loans to fund his deal. He has sold about $8.5 billion worth of Tesla shares and lined up 18 co-investors who will contribute over $7 billion—which might lead to a complicated ownership structure after Twitter is taken private. Musk still needs to come up with $12 billion in cash.
In an interview with the Financial Times on May 11, Musk said it will take at least two to three months to complete the takeover. Under the deal’s terms, Musk will have to pay $1 billion in breakup fee if the acquisition falls apart.
Still committed to acquisition

196,13-May-22,Barron's (Online),Corporate Law Expert Says Musk Can't Just Walk Away From Twitter Deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2663561150/BFD812D457A14912PQ/612?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk seemed to throw another wrench in his own deal for Twitter on Friday, but an expert on corporate law and M&A says walking away, for Musk, isn't as simple as paying a $1 billion breakup fee.
Musk said on Twitter that his acquisition of the platform was ""temporarily on hold"" pending details about a calculation on the amount of Twitter's fake accounts. He referred to a disclosure earlier this month that fewer than 5% of monetizable daily active users were fake or spam accounts. Musk followed up the post with a clarification: ""Still committed to acquisition.""
Twitter declined to comment on Musk's posts. Tesla didn't return a request to make Musk available for comment.
Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, told Barron's that for Musk to successfully walk away from the deal, he would need to prove revelations about bots and how Twitter disclosed their presence among its user counts had a ""material adverse effect"" on the firm.
""These kinds of claims tend not to be strong,"" Quinn says. ""So there's a lot of bravado, a lot of back and forth, but they tend not to be strong. You do find people renegotiating prices downward, but not by a whole lot.""
Musk's comments follow a broader slide for technology stocks, which likely would have included Twitter had there not been a deal at $54.20 in place. Quinn says that though potential acquirers often have buyer's remorse after signing a deal shortly before a market slide, the way the merger agreement is structured, that doesn't count for anything. He says if Musk tries to walk away, Twitter has the option to take Musk to court instead of accepting a $1 billion breakup fee.
If Twitter can prove to a Delaware court that Musk's financing is still in place, the court could issue an order for specific performance that would compel Musk to close the merger, Quinn says.
""A Delaware court that looks at this merger agreement will give an order for specific performance if this deal is capable of being closed,"" Quinn says. ""And if Musk just says 'I'm not going to do it,' they will get the order and they'll force him to close.""
Merger arbitrage traders are still skeptical. Twitter stock fell 9.5% in Friday trading. At $40.80, shares are off 25% from the deal price Musk agreed to, implying traders don't believe a deal is a sure thing, at least at $54.20.

197,13-May-22,Boston Globe (Online),Elon Musk sows doubt over his $44 billion Twitter takeover,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2663397943/BFD812D457A14912PQ/654?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk caused chaos over his takeover bid for Twitter Inc, first claiming his bid was was “temporarily on hold,” then maintained he is “still committed” to the deal, sending the social media giant into a tailspin.The billionaire initially sent an early tweet saying the $44 billion deal is pending until he receives more information about the proportion of fake accounts on the social media site, which sent Twitter stock tumbling as much as 25% in premarket trading. A few hours later he sent another tweet saying he is “still committed” to the deal. Twitter's shares recouped some of their losses but were down about 10%.Musk said he was waiting for details on a recent filing from Twitter that fake accounts on the social media platform contributed less than 5% of its users. Twitter said in its latest quarterly results “that the average of false or spam accounts during the first quarter of 2022 represented fewer than 5% of our monthly daily active users during the quarter.” However, Twitter said it applied “significant judgment” to its latest estimate, and the true number could be higher.Fighting fake accounts has been a cornerstone of Musk's bid to reform Twitter. In a statement announcing his deal to buy the company last month, he revealed he wanted to defeat spam bots, authenticate all humans, and make its algorithms open source. Musk has also said he'd like to make the platform a bastion of free speech, taking the guardrails off of content moderation.Bots are currently allowed on Twitter, though under the company's policy such accounts are supposed to indicate that they're automated. The platform has even launched a label for “good” bots, such as @tinycarebot, an account that tweets self-care reminders. Spam bots, however, are not permitted, and the company has policies meant to combat them.Why Spam Bots are Top of Elon Musk's Twitter Hit List: QuickTakeDoubts have grown in recent days that Musk would be able to pull off his acquisition of Twitter, and that the entrepreneur may consider dropping his bidding price for the micro-blogging site.“There will also be questions raised over whether fake accounts are the real reason behind this delaying tactic,” said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, “given that promoting free speech rather than focusing on wealth creation appeared to be his primary motivation for the takeover. The $44 billion price tag is huge, and it may be a strategy to row back on the amount he is prepared to pay to acquire the platform.”The proposed takeover includes a $1 billion breakup fee for each party, which Musk will have to pay if he ends the deal or fails to deliver the acquisition funding as promised. It is unclear whether an update by Twitter on the number of fake accounts -- if materially larger than 5% -- would trigger a so-called material adverse effect clause, releasing Musk from the breakup fee.The spread on the deal, which offers an indication of how much Wall Street believes the takeover will be completed, swelled further on Thursday to $9.11 from $8.11 in the previous session. That was the widest level since the billionaire launched his bid last month to purchase the Twitter for $54.20 -- and double where it was last week when he announced a roughly $7.1 billion financing commitment.Musk's latest tweet landed just hours after news that Twitter was freezing hiring as part of pre-deal cost-cutting efforts. Two of Twitter's top leaders are also departing. Kayvon Beykpour, head of consumer product, and Bruce Falck, in charge of revenue product, were both asked to leave the company by Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal, the two executives said in separate public posts.The changes reflect Twitter's current state of limbo while it awaits a new owner. Hindenburg Research LLC, an investment research firm that focuses on activist short-selling, said on Monday that it sees a “significant risk” that Musk's proposed offer gets repriced lower.The analysts cited the ongoing meltdown in technology shares, Twitter's own weak first-quarter results, including restating several years of user numbers, and the prospect that Musk will sell his 9% stake if the deal doesn't come together.Aside from doubts over the extent of spam bots on Twitter's platform, the world's richest person is still working to secure the money to actually complete the deal. Musk has been in talks with investors to raise enough equity and preferred financing to eliminate the need for any margin loan linked to his Tesla shares, according to people with knowledge of the matter.He recently disclosed $7.1 billion in equity commitments from investors including Larry Ellison, Sequoia Capital, Qatar Holding and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, with the latter rolling his Twitter stock into the deal.“Musk has never had the full funding – we know that from his constant attempts to get financial support – but he also held all the cards,” said Neil Campling, head of TMT research at Mirabaud Equity Research. “The Twitter board have been held hostage and only have themselves to blame for this mess. No other buyer will emerge – if Musk decides he is still interested he can name his price and it won't be higher.”"
198,14-May-22,The Washington Post,Twitter shares slide as Musk says takeover bid is on hold,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2663822455/BFD812D457A14912PQ/318?accountid=13946,"Mogul is 'committed,' 
but analysts suspect he's angling for a lower price

SAN FRANCISCO - Elon Musk tweeted early Friday that his $44 billion bid to buy Twitter was temporarily on hold, opening up a potential door for renegotiation and raising uncertainty about his push to take the social media site private.
His declaration cast fresh doubt on the seriousness of his offer just as he was scrambling to find new investors to help him fund the deal. It also played into his hand by sending Twitter's stock price tumbling, though the tweet had the potential to draw regulatory scrutiny.
""Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users,"" Musk tweeted, linking to a Reuters article last week citing a Twitter filing. Roughly two hours later, he added, ""Still committed to acquisition.""
Spam bots, accounts that peddle cryptocurrency scams and otherwise seek to exploit vulnerable users, have long been a pet peeve of the technology mogul, who regularly encounters impersonators in his activity on the site.
But his public declaration was an unusual and unexpected maneuver at this stage of the negotiations, according to financial experts and people familiar with the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. The deal was expected to close in the next three to six months, but the tweets Friday could represent an effort by Musk to return to the negotiation table to buy Twitter for less than previously agreed upon.
It also sent Tesla's stock price, which had declined steeply this year, upward while Twitter's stumbled. Musk owns a major stake in Tesla and had committed billions of dollars of his personal wealth toward funding the deal. The increase in prices Friday allowed Musk to recoup some of his net worth, while also reducing the market value of the company he is seeking to buy.
Twitter shares fell by nearly 10 percent Friday, while Tesla shares rose nearly 6 percent. Investors in the electric automaker, led by Musk, have been concerned about the billionaire leveraging his stake to fund the Twitter deal.
Musk's cold feet over the concern that there might be more spam bots than he thought may represent an attempt to trigger a clause in the contract that allows the deal to be called off if an unforeseen event significantly hurts Twitter's business prospects, according to legal experts and people close to the deal.
Still, at least one person familiar with the negotiations cast doubt on the impact of Musk's strategy. ""We haven't seen one iota of evidence that the deal is on hold,"" said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the discussions. ""Things continue today just as they were yesterday."" Bots would be a ""routine"" subject of discussion for such a deal, the person said.
Urska Velikonja, a law professor at Georgetown University, said of the saga: ""Anyone trying to predict how this ends up is a fool.""
Musk and Twitter did not comment for this article.
Twitter continued to spiral into further management chaos this week, with chief executive Parag Agrawal firing two top deputies and announcing a hiring freeze. On Friday, Agrawal tweeted that he needed to cut costs because of the macroeconomic environment. ""I won't use the deal as an excuse to avoid making important decisions for the health of the company, nor will any leader at Twitter,"" he said.
Musk's statement that the deal was on hold has the potential to draw the eye of securities regulators, who would examine whether his public declarations about the deal while in active pursuit of the company ran afoul of securities laws.
Musk is prone to brash statements on Twitter, where he has more than 90 million followers, something that has drawn scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The terms of the deal require a $1 billion breakup fee, though his tweet left some pondering whether he was seeking to circumvent that cost. And securities law experts said Musk backing out at this stage could result in a protracted and messy legal battle, leaving the tech mogul incurring costs well over the penalty for walking away.
Before the tweet, Musk already was seeking additional investors for the purchase as a market downturn put pressure on his financing. Advisers close to Musk, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing discussions, said the about-face probably was a negotiating tactic, but it also signaled possible buyer's remorse.
Tesla has lost about $400 billion in market value since Musk's interest in Twitter became public in April, driving a wedge in his acquisition plans at a time when he has committed $21 billion of his wealth to finance the purchase. Musk had planned to buy Twitter with a combination of loans and equity commitments, leveraging into the deal much of his stake in the most valuable automaker, from which he derives most of his wealth.
His net worth, which makes Musk the richest man in the world, has fallen by as much as roughly $50 billion in recent weeks, according to the Forbes wealth index. And Tesla stock has shed nearly 30 percent of its value in just the past month. Musk disclosed more than $7 billion of financing last week from sources including investment firms, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, the Qatar sovereign wealth fund and Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal.
Now Musk is seeking out additional investments beyond what he had initially planned, because of the economic downturn and the weakening of Tesla stock, according to people familiar with the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.
In part because of the downturn, Musk and the bankers involved in the deal have been under pressure to solidify partners, including Yahoo owner Apollo Global Management, which is expected to extend more than $1 billion of financing with a group of partners, according to one of the people.
Prospective investors who have spoken with The Washington Post said interest in the bid remains high because of the belief Musk would make good on his investment, despite his declaration that the economics of Twitter are not his concern.
""To do this in a tweet and not in a filing is unconscionable, and it sends the market into a circus show,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.
The problem of Twitter bots also is not new to Musk. He has cited ridding the social media site of spam bots, or automated accounts that often promote products or schemes, as one of his main focuses for improving Twitter.
""If our twitter bid succeeds, we will defeat the spam bots or die trying!"" he tweeted last month. In a broadcast interview this week, he reiterated that the company needs to crack down on the bots and build trust with users.
Experts explained how Musk could seek to use the bot issue to renegotiate the price of the deal.
 ""I can only say that in merger terms, it's a fairly slender reed for canceling a deal,"" said Ann Lipton, a law professor at Tulane University. ""Sometimes this kind of thing is used as a basis for renegotiating a deal price, but again, unless the problem is having far more impact on Twitter financially than has been reported, it's not strong ground for that, either.""
The terms of Musk's deal to buy Twitter allow him to tweet about his acquisition ""so long as such tweets do not disparage"" the company or any of its representatives.
Musk has put Twitter between a rock and a hard place, said Velikonja, the Georgetown University law professor. If Musk walks away from the deal, Twitter would be forced into an expensive and lengthy legal battle to recover damages for the havoc Musk has wreaked on the company. If Twitter's board renegotiates a lower price with Musk, it probably will face shareholder lawsuits claiming the company took a lower-than-necessary price.
Musk launched his ownership bid with a goal to promote ""free speech"" on the site, a stance some employees worry could lead to the rollback of safety policies the company has put in place to protect users online. In recent weeks, Musk has cautioned that he is not yet the owner of Twitter, although he has laid clear plans for the social media service, such as restoring the account of former president Donald Trump, who was banned after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
The deal also could be affected by outside factors, such as regulatory scrutiny. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the SEC was investigating Musk for late notification that he had purchased a 5 percent stake in Twitter.
The Post previously reported that such a delay might have earned him $156 million. Musk has leveraged much of his Tesla stock as collateral for his loans, making the recent economic downturn a particular issue for his bid. Tesla has warned of the risks it faces because of the amount of Tesla stock Musk has committed as collateral.
Tesla stock was trading at under $770 on Friday, a slight recovery from earlier in the week but well below the more than $1,100 mark from early April. A drop by several hundred more dollars could trigger requirements that would force Musk to sell some shares, analysts said.

199,14-May-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Musk Says Twitter Deal Is 'On Hold',https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2663888645/BFD812D457A14912PQ/393?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk said his planned acquisition of Twitter Inc. was ""temporarily on hold"" because of concerns about fake accounts, a surprise twist that jolted investors and raised questions about his willingness to go through with the $44 billion transaction.
Mr. Musk's grenade came in a tweet posted at 5:44 a.m. Eastern Time that was followed just over two hours later by another saying he was ""still committed to acquisition."" Lawyers close to Mr. Musk urged him to send that follow-up tweet, according to people familiar with the matter.
The initial announcement was unorthodox not just in its timing and format, but because Mr. Musk referenced a recent Twitter disclosure about fake and spam accounts that it has made consistently for years -- and because Mr. Musk has already signed an agreement for the purchase and waived detailed due diligence on the deal.
The sudden shake-up fueled questions about whether Mr. Musk is committed to a deal that was struck amid a sharp decline in technology stocks that has made Twitter less valuable on paper than it was a month ago when he made his offer of $54.20 a share. Twitter shares, which were already trading well below that level, fell 10% in Friday trading to $40.72.
People in Twitter's camp said Mr. Musk's first tweet was a surprise and that he hadn't reached out to the company ahead of time. But they played down its significance and said the second tweet, indicating that the deal is still on, is the one that matters. The company continues working to complete the acquisition and is supplying Mr. Musk with all the relevant information under the terms of the contract, according to a person familiar with Twitter's response.
Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal on Friday said, ""While I expect the deal to close, we need to be prepared for all scenarios,"" a day after he internally announced a hiring freeze and cost cuts.
Mr. Musk was aware of questions about fake and spam accounts on Twitter when he agreed to the acquisition -- he has raised concerns about it in his own tweets for years. In Friday's post on his verified Twitter account, he said: ""Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users.""
He linked to a May 2 report about a Twitter securities filing that said it estimates that false or spam accounts represented fewer than 5% of its daily active users. The company has reported the same figure in its annual reports since it went public in 2013.
Late Friday, Mr. Musk signaled he would try to check the figure and urged others to do the same. ""To find out, my team will do a random sample of 100 followers of @twitter. I invite others to repeat the same process and see what they discover,"" he wrote in a tweet. Prompted by some of his more-than 90 million Twitter followers, Mr. Musk then proceeded to spell out ideas on how to proceed. ""If we collectively try to figure out the bot/duplicate user percentage, we can probably crowdsource a good answer,"" he added.
Mr. Musk, asked on Twitter whether he had thought about the issue before making his $44 billion purchase commitment, said ""I relied upon the accuracy of Twitter's public filing.""
It couldn't be determined if the latest tweets were a negotiating tactic to abandon the transaction or reprice the deal.
Many big tech stocks have been falling, including shares of Tesla, which have retreated 29% since Mr. Musk's investment in Twitter became public. Mr. Musk is using his Tesla holdings to help fund the Twitter deal. Meanwhile, Twitter's stock price has traded below Mr. Musk's offer price as investors wondered if the deal might get reworked or not get done.
Susannah Streeter, an investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said there will be skepticism whether the fake accounts are the real reason for the delaying tactic. ""The $44 billion price tag is huge, and it may be a strategy to row back on the amount he is prepared to pay to acquire the platform,"" she said.
After Hindenburg Research LLC, an activist short seller, this week called the Twitter deal overpriced and said that there is ""significant risk"" it could get repriced lower, Mr. Musk tweeted in response: ""Interesting. Don't forget to look on the bright side of life sometimes!""
If the deal does fall apart, Mr. Musk could owe Twitter $1 billion depending on the reason for the breakup.
Because Mr. Musk waived doing detailed due diligence on the deal, it could make it more difficult for him to back out over something like a discrepancy in the number of spam accounts. If he tries to, the company could attempt to force him to complete the deal under a legal protection called ""specific performance,"" though that maneuver is rarely successful in practice.
In 2020, luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE tried to back out of a deal to buy Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 billion after the pandemic hurt demand for high-end jewelry. Tiffany sued to enforce the agreement and LVMH countersued, arguing the business had been so deeply damaged that their original agreement was no longer valid. The two sides later agreed to cut the price by a relatively modest $430 million and settle related litigation.
Mr. Musk's initial tweet Friday could be seen as critical of Twitter, which could further complicate things. The merger agreement stipulates that he can tweet about the deal so long as he doesn't disparage the company or any of its representatives.
Before Friday, Mr. Musk had appeared to be moving forward on the deal in meetings with Twitter and hadn't attempted to restart negotiations, but he had started asking questions about the number of spam accounts on the platform, people familiar with the matter said.
Twitter has warned that its estimate of fake and spam accounts is based on a sampling of accounts and that ""the actual number of false or spam accounts could be higher than we have estimated.""
Mr. Musk's tweets Friday are the latest twist in the unorthodox attempt to take over the social-media giant by the world's richest man. It began with Mr. Musk buying a large chunk of Twitter shares on the open market earlier this year as a passive investor, which soon turned into a full-fledged buyout offer, outlined in a four-paragraph letter and several text messages to Twitter's chairman.
The per-share offer price of $54.20 contained a veiled reference to marijuana. The latest bombshell comes on a superstitious date: Friday the 13th.
Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali said he could see a scenario where Mr. Musk tries reducing the offer price by 15% to 20%, to $46 or $43 a share. ""If he's successful, then his ability to secure funding while lowering his reliance on Tesla shares increases pretty dramatically,"" Mr. Squali said.
In addition to financing from Wall Street, Mr. Musk has had to sell at least $8.5 billion of Tesla shares to fund the deal. He has also assembled a cast of 19 investors, from a Saudi prince to Silicon Valley stalwarts, to put up another $7 billion.

200,16-May-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla's Shanghai Plant Isn't at Full Production. Here's When Things Get Back to Normal.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2664729400/BFD812D457A14912PQ/79?accountid=13946,"Tesla has delayed returning production at its plant in Shanghai to levels before the city's strict Covid-19 lockdowns by at least a week. Pandemic restrictions remain a problem for the entire auto industry, but the end appears to be in sight.
That's good news for the stock, although its tough to figure out what's been driving Tesla (ticker: TSLA) shares lately. Reuters, citing an internal memo, reported Monday that Tesla plans to stick to one shift at the plant for the current week, with output per day of about 1,200 units. Shanghai is still locked down. And Tesla, as a result, has been operating its most productive plant in a closed loop setting with workers, essentially, living at the plant. Tesla, of course, wants to restore full output but that is dependent on the parts supply ramping back up and Tesla restoring its second shift.
The decision to delay by a week, or perhaps two, appears to align with local decisions to gradually lift lockdown restrictions. Recent reports have officials gradually lifting restrictions with a return to more normal life starting in June . That's if infection rates fall in late May.
When the plant returns to normal production, Tesla will be aiming for making roughly 2,600 vehicles per day. That implies average monthly output of about 78,000. That's if everything goes perfectly. Tesla shipped almost 71,000 vehicles from the Shanghai plant in December 2021. Shipments amounted to just 1,512 units in April. The plant didn't operate for much of the month.
Before Covid lockdowns, Wall Street expected Tesla global shipments to reach about 350,000 vehicles in the second quarter, up from 310,000 in the first quarter. Now estimates are around 280,000, according to FactSet. The lost 70,000 vehicles are all due to China.
Tesla stock has fallen about 30% since the end of March, around the time Covid lockdowns shut the plant. It's difficult to figure how much Shanghai-related angst is in the stock. The entire stock market has declined sharply. The Nasdaq Composite has fallen about 18% over the same span.
Tesla stock has dropped more, but it is usually more volatile than the overall market, rising faster in good times and falling faster in bad times.
Along with the market decline, Tesla investors have also seen some stock volatility from Elon Musk's bid for Twitter (TWTR). It's been a wild few weeks for shareholders.
Second-quarter deliveries numbers will be released the first couple of days of July. Investors will have to brace for more volatility between now and then. The plant will be ramping back up, the market will be dealing with inflation and there will surely be more headlines about Musk and Twitter.
Tesla stock was down 1.9% Monday to $754.17.
Tesla stock jumped 5.7% on Friday after CEO Elon Musk said his recently announced deal to buy Twitter was "" temporarily on hold "" pending a calculation related to the number of fake accounts on the social media platform.

201,16-May-22,The New York Observer,"Why Elon Musk Is Having Second Thoughts About Buying Twitter, According to a Top Tesla Analyst",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2664949697/BFD812D457A14912PQ/202?accountid=13946,"Cold feet. Sean Zanni/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images
Elon Musk says his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter is temporarily on hold because he is investigating how many of the platform’s users are real. It’s possible the world’s richest man didn’t conduct proper due diligence before submitting his offer. Or perhaps he’s having second thoughts about buying Twitter and looking for an excuse to back out.
The takeover, which has involved multiple investment banks and more than a dozen co-investors, now has a less than 50 percent chance of going through, according to Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst known for his coverage of Tesla stock.
“Our view is while Musk is committed to the deal, the massive pressure on Tesla’s stock since the deal, a changing stock market/risk environment the last month, and a number of other financing factors has caused Musk to get ‘cold feet’ on the Twitter deal,” Ives’ team wrote in a note to clients on May 16.
Ives added that the proportion of spam account on Twitter, which Musk claims is slowing down the deal, is “not a new issue and likely more of a scapegoat to push for a lower price.”
Under Musk’s agreement with Twitter, he will have to pay $1 billion in breakup fee if the deal falls apart.
Pushing for a lower price might be necessary, given Musk’s struggle finding the money to pay for the deal.
Tesla’s falling share prices complicates Musk’s plans
Musk has said he plans to sell $21 billion worth of his Tesla stock to fund the Twitter purchase. Tesla’s share price has fallen sharply in recent weeks, meaning that he would have to sell a lot more shares than he initially wanted to get the cash.
Tesla’s share price is down 28 percent since the acquisition was announced on April 24. The anticipation of Musk’s heavy unloading of his shares, Tesla’s manufacturing turmoil in China, and a broad market selloff all contributed to Tesla’s decline.
Yet Musk is pointing at Twitter for pausing the deal. He suspects bot accounts make up a bigger portion of Twitter users than the less than 5 percent claimed by the company. Since Musk said removing bot accounts is a key goal once he owns Twitter, he won’t move forward until he has definitive information about its user makeup.
The exact number of bot accounts is something that can only be calculated internally because it requires the use of private user information, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal explained in a series of tweets on May 16.
“We don’t believe that this specific estimation can be performed externally,” Agrawal wrote in one of the tweets, adding that, without private data such as geolocation and IP addresses, it’s not even possible to know which accounts are counted as daily active users.
Musk dismissed Agrawal’s arguments by replying with a turd emoji. In a text response later, he suggested bot information should be at least available to Twitter’s advertisers. “So how do advertisers know what they’re getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,” Musk tweeted."
202,16-May-22,Barron's (Online),The Market Is Losing Confidence Elon Musk Will Buy Twitter at $54.20,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2664930846/BFD812D457A14912PQ/230?accountid=13946,"The Elon Musk -Buying- Twitter saga took more dramatic turns Monday. Twitter investors don't appear convinced the ordeal will end with Musk buying the social media platform.
Twitter (ticker: TWTR) stock closed down 8.1% Monday at $37.39. That is $16.81 below Musk's original offer price of $54.20. That implies gains of about 45% if the deal were to happen as originally envisioned.
The market believes the odds of that happening are very low. Arbitrage calculations imply less than 20%.
There is good reason the market is abandoning the hope for $54.20. The biggest reason comes from Musk. He paused his purchase, according to a tweet sent Friday, over Twitter math that spam bots are less than 5% of daily usage.
Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal wrote a detailed thread about the difficulty of calculating spam as a percentage of the platform's daily active usage. Musk responded to the thread with a poop emoji.
Twitter didn't respond to a request for comment about spam calculations.
""Our view in a nutshell is that the $54.20 deal price for Twitter is now out the window …it's about either driving a lower deal price or Musk could walk away,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a Monday report.
Although Ives covers Tesla, not Twitter, he believes Musk could walk. Tesla investors would probably welcome that. Tesla stock closed down 5.9% Monday at $724.27 a share.
There is still some hope for a deal though. Evidence comes from recent stock trading as well as from Musk himself.
Twitter stock was $39.31 before Musk's initial 9%-plus stake was disclosed in early April. The Nasdaq Composite is down about 17% since then. If Twitter traded with the market, adjusted for its typical volatility, shares would be, roughly speaking, between $32 and $33 a piece now.
Twitter shares are still about $5 above that. That is one sign the market seems to be betting on renegotiation.
And Bloomberg reported that Musk said a new deal at a lower price wasn't ""out of the question"" while speaking at the All-In Summit .
Twitter and Musk declined to comment about renegotiation.
Given all the news, Twitter shareholders, as well as arbitrage traders, appear to be building in a bigger margin of safety. The same market move that would put Twitter shares between $32 and $33 would adjust Musk's original bid price to about $44 or $45 a share. Twitter stock is about $7, or almost 20%, below that level.
A bigger margin of safety is probably sensible at this point. There are many more chapters left in this saga.

203,17-May-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk Says Twitter Deal Can't Move Forward Without Clarity on Fake Accounts; Tesla CEO's comments add to questions about whether he is committed to concluding a $44 billion deal struck during a selloff in tech stocks,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2665018747/BFD812D457A14912PQ/223?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk said his $44 billion purchase of Twitter Inc. can't move forward until the company is clearer about how many of its accounts are fake, casting fresh doubt on his planned takeover of the social-media company.
Mr. Musk's latest comments add to questions about whether he is committed to concluding a deal that was struck amid a steep selloff in technology stocks. Last week, he said the deal was ""on hold"" over concerns about fake accounts on the platform— a problem that has long dogged social-media companies .
In a tweet early Tuesday, Mr. Musk said that Twitter's chief executive had refused to show proof that less than 5% of Twitter's accounts were fake. ""This deal cannot move forward until he does,"" he said.
Mr. Musk said his offer was based on Twitter's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission being accurate, and added: ""20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be *much* higher.""
Mr. Musk's tweet was in response to an article covering his own estimate, made at a conference a day earlier, in which he estimated that fake users make up at least 20% of all Twitter accounts. Mr. Musk's figure roughly matches one in a new report from a market-research firm, SparkToro. The firm says it includes in its figures automated accounts that could be considered legitimate, such as ones that post a feed of news headlines.
In securities filings, Twitter has long estimated that false or spam accounts represent less than 5% of its total number of active users, but has also said that the actual number ""could be higher than we have estimated.""
In a statement Tuesday, Twitter said it ""is committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable.""
Twitter's board said in a separate statement that Mr. Musk agreed to pay $54.20 a share for Twitter. ""We believe this agreement is in the best interest of all shareholders,"" it said. ""We intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement.""
On Monday, Twitter Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal defended his company's efforts to fight spam .
""First, let me state the obvious: spam harms the experience for real people on Twitter, and therefore can harm our business,"" Mr. Agrawal said as part of a series of posts on Monday. ""As such, we are strongly incentivized to detect and remove as much spam as we possibly can, every single day. Anyone who suggests otherwise is just wrong.""
 PHOTOS: How Elon Musk Made the Fortune He'll Need to Buy Twitter 
He said Twitter suspends more than half a million spam accounts a day and locks millions of accounts suspected of being fake weekly if they can't be verified by humans.
Last week, Mr. Musk, the CEO of Tesla Inc., said he would try to verify Twitter's numbers and said others should do the same. Mr. Agrawal suggested that external estimates of spam accounts wouldn't be accurate.
""Unfortunately, we don't believe that this specific estimation can be performed externally, given the critical need to use both public and private information [which we can't share],"" Mr. Agrawal said Monday. ""Externally, it's not even possible to know which accounts are counted as mDAUs on any given day,"" he added, referring to monetizable daily active users.
Mr. Musk responded with a number of tweets, with one showing a poop emoji .
Twitter, in a regulatory filing early Tuesday that detailed how the deal came together, said that Mr. Musk had raised the prospect of a takeover early on in discussions with its board, well before his stake in the firm became public.
Mr. Musk initiated outreach on March 26, according to the filing, separately contacting Jack Dorsey, Twitter's former CEO and current board member, and another director, Egon Durban, co-CEO of private-equity firm Silver Lake.
That led to a meeting the next day with Mr. Agrawal and Bret Taylor, Twitter's chairman, in which they discussed Mr. Musk potentially joining the board. Mr. Musk also said he was considering taking Twitter private or starting a rival service, according to the filing.
That meeting came more than a week before Mr. Musk first publicly disclosed his Twitter stake, on April 4, when it had grown to around 9.2% of the company's stock. He declared himself a passive investor, signaling he had no intention to change or influence control of the company. The disclosure, which came days after a required filing deadline, is now subject to a Securities and Exchange Commission probe .
Mr. Musk on April 9 said he wouldn't join the board, and instead planned to make an offer to take the company private, which led to a deal on April 25 for him to buy the company.
Tuesday's filing, which runs to 235 pages, contains no mention of discussions between Mr. Musk and Twitter officials about fake, spam or bot accounts.
Twitter stock closed up 2.49% at $38.32, leaving shares still well below the $54.20 a share at which Mr. Musk had agreed to buy the company, and below where Twitter's shares traded before Mr. Musk first disclosed that he took a stake in the company on April 4.
Mr. Musk's insistence on the issue of fake accounts has raised speculation that he may try to renegotiate or walk away from the purchase—though he has already signed an agreement and waived detailed due diligence on the deal. Mr. Musk and Twitter would each owe the other $1 billion if either walks away from the deal in certain circumstances, according to securities filings, but such a clause wouldn't preclude a renegotiation—or a lawsuit.
Some outside analyses have found that Twitter may have more fake accounts than it discloses—though they use different methodology than Twitter and include accounts that the company excludes from its estimates.
SparkToro says its analysis of a representative sample of active Twitter accounts found that 19% fit what it calls a conservative definition of fake or spam accounts.
But SparkToro specifies that its definition of fake accounts includes all accounts that don't regularly have a human composing their tweets, which are common on Twitter for sending such information as news updates, inspirational quotes and stock-price changes. Twitter offers tools for developers to build automated bots.

204,17-May-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Might Sell Some SpaceX Stock at 25% Bump in Value. That Makes Sense.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2665077454/BFD812D457A14912PQ/320?accountid=13946,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk might sell some SpaceX stock if the price is right.
The New York Post reported that Musk might sell stock to help finance his purchase of Twitter (ticker: TWTR).
Musk owns about 44% of the aerospace giant, which is currently valued at about $100 billion in private markets. The Post said Musk was looking for a 25% bump in value, giving SpaceX a $125 billion market value.
SpaceX didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the sale or recent valuations.
The 25% bump would be impressive for the company, but it makes some sense. The $100 billion valuation was achieved late in 2021 . And while the overall market is down — the S&P 500 is off about 12% since the start of December —aerospace and defense companies in the S&P 500 have risen about 5% since then.
The performance of the industry index looks even better if Boeing (BA) is backed out. Boeing has declined about 37% since late 2021. Excluding that stock, the aerospace & defense index would be up about 20%. Lockheed Martin (LMT) shares, for instance, have jumped more than 30% since the start of December.
The valuation bump would make Musk's SpaceX stake worth roughly $55 billion. His Tesla (TSLA) stake, excluding vested stock options, is worth about $118 billion. That value has been declining dramatically. Tesla stock has been badly beaten up in the recent tech selloff. Shares are down about 37% since Musk's initial 9%-plus stake in Twitter was disclosed in early April.
Overall, Musk's Tesla stake is worth about $69 billion less, compared with the early April level.
In late April, Musk sold about $8.5 billion in Tesla stock, also presumably to fund his Twitter purchase. That sale, plus equity raised by third parties along with committed debt financing, totals roughly $33 billion. Musk needs, very roughly, to raise another $7 billion or so to buy the 91% of Twitter he doesn't own.
That's if Musk pays $54.20 a share , and that's a big if. Musk raised the possibility of a lower price on Monday at a conference . He has raised concern about the how much spam accounts represents of Twitter's active daily usage.
Ultimately, if Musk isn't satisfied with the what he finds out about spam accounts, he could scuttle the deal. Then he wouldn't have to sell the SpaceX shares.
Musk tweeted Tuesday that the Twitter deal "" cannot move forward ' until there is some validation of Twitter's assertion that spam accounts represent less than 5% of daily active usage.
That tweet was sending Twitter stock lower. Shares fell 1.6% in premarket trading after falling 8.2% Monday. Tesla stock, on the other hand, is up 2.8%. S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose about 1.8% and 1.5%, respectively.

205,17-May-22,Barron's (Online),Twitter Is a Buy if Elon Musk Is Negotiating. It's a Sell if He's Walking Away.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2665065598/BFD812D457A14912PQ/586?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk's latest broadside against the management of Twitter, the company he has offered to buy for $44 billion, looks like either a negotiating tactic or an excuse to abandon the deal.
The hard part is figuring out which.
Musk on Tuesday tweeted that he needed to see proof of management's claim that fewer than 5% of daily Twitter users are spam or bot accounts for the deal to go ahead.
That was a more considered response than the one he gave on Monday, after CEO Parag Agrawal wrote a detailed thread about the difficulty of calculating spam as a percentage of the platform's usage. Musk replied with a poop emoji.
Musk's Tuesday statement added that his offer was conditional on the company's public statements being accurate. Maybe it's a way to dispute paying the well-known $1 billion breakup fee Musk agreed to if the deal falls through. Even though, as the world's richest man worth more than $200 billion, the fee wouldn't exactly break the bank.
On the other hand, there are also signs that Musk is still very serious about making the deal happen. Bloomberg reported that he told a conference that doing the deal at a lower price wasn't ""out of the question.""
The Tesla CEO may also be selling SpaceX shares, the proceeds from which could be used to finance the deal, the New York Post reported. He already has financial backing from big names such as Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison and the Qatari sovereign-wealth fund.
Twitter fell more than 8% on Monday and continued dropping in the premarket. Whatever price Musk eventually is able to get, it will almost surely be higher than the current share price. The only thing an investor has to determine is what Musk wants. He may not even know that himself.

Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Loaded Up on Stocks in Q1
Berkshire Hathaway snapped up $51 billion of stocks in the first quarter, more than in any other three-month period in its history. Most of the buying was around the time the market tumbled in early March, heeding CEO Warren Buffett's call to be ""greedy when others are fearful.""
* In new activity, Berkshire held 55 million shares of Citigroup on March 31, now valued at $2.6 billion. Berkshire also owned 69 million shares of Paramount Global, the media company, valued at $1.9 billion.
* Energy was another focus. Berkshire held 159 million shares of Chevron as of March 31, now valued at $27.5 billion and 137 million shares of Occidental. With a share purchase last week, Berkshire now has 143 million shares of Occidental valued at $9.7 billion.
* The energy stakes, in particular, reflect Buffett's preference for low valuations and shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Dividend-paying stocks offer a steady stream of cash in the face of volatile markets.
* Berkshire eliminated nearly all of its Verizon Communications stake in the quarter, holding just 1.4 million shares on March 31, down from almost 159 million shares on Dec. 31. Barron's wrote earlier this month that Berkshire likely sold all or most of the stake.
What's Next: Berkshire's investments in Chevron and Occidental might reflect a bet that commodities prices will stay elevated for a while, analysts said. Energy stocks are the best-performing group in the S&P 500 this year, benefiting from a surge in commodities prices that began after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Abbott Could Start Baby-Formula Production in 2 Weeks
Abbott Laboratories could restart the Michigan baby-formula plant that closed during a product recall after the company reached an agreement with the Food and Drug Administration. If the FDA approves, formula production could begin in two weeks, though the product won't hit shelves for six to eight weeks.
* Abbott confirmed guidance for adjusted earnings of $4.70 a share for the year, saying it would face one-time charges related to the agreement but it doesn't expect those charges will be material. Abbott's shares are down 22.1% this year.
* Abbott in February voluntarily recalled powdered formulas including Alimentum, EleCare, and Similac brands, after possible contamination with a bacterial infection called Cronobacter sakazakii. Four babies got sick and two died after consuming formula.
* But Abbott said Monday that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ended its investigation with no findings of a link between Abbott formulas and infant illnesses. It also said retained product tested at the facility came back negative for Cronobacter sakazakii and Salmonella.
* The FDA agreement comes amid a nationwide shortage that has sent parents and caregivers into panicked hunts for formula. Nationally, 43% of baby formula is out of stock, The Wall Street Journal reported.
What's Next: The FDA on Monday encouraged foreign baby-formula manufacturers to apply to ship their formula to the U.S., saying it set up a more flexible process for imports to the U.S. as it also works to boost domestic production.

Wall Street Pros Lower Their Outlooks for 2022
Four and a half months into 2022, a Barron's panel of forecasters appears to have underestimated the odds of slower economic growth, more persistent inflation, and tighter monetary conditions this year. The S&P 500 has declined about 15% so far this year, to around 4000 points.
* The Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases are the culprit. The S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio has dropped to about 17 times today, from nearly 22 times at the beginning of 2022.
* Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, now sees an S&P 500 floor at around 3400 based on technical indicators and valuation support around 14 or 15 times forward earnings. That would be another 15% drop. In December, Wilson expected it to be at 4400 at the end of 2022.
* Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities' head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, has trimmed her year-end S&P 500 target to 4500, from 4600 in December.
* Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, expects S&P 500 earnings per share of $265 in 2023 and for a forward P/E ratio of 16 times to 19 times at year end. That would put the S&P at between 4200 and 5000 at the end of 2022.
What's Next: Goldman Sachs' economists pared their forecasts for U.S. economic growth to 2.4% this year and 1.6% in 2023, down from earlier projections of 2.6% and 2.2%, respectively, as some analysts float the idea of a recession ahead.

Ford Now Owns Less than 10% of Rivian's Shares
Ford Motor is likely done selling part of its stake in the electric-vehicle start-up Rivian Automotive months after the company went public, according to an analysis by Barron's. Ford still owns about 87 million Rivian shares.
* Ford's sale of seven million shares of Rivian on Friday, at an average of $26.88, put its shares at below the 10% ownership level. That means Ford would no longer be required to disclose such transactions, said accounting consultant Robert Willens.
* Ford told Barron's that the sale locked in some of the gains on its Rivian investment. But getting below the 10% threshold also means investors won't hear about further sales until Ford reports its quarterly earnings.
* Rivian investor Amazon.com on Monday reiterated to Barron's that ""Rivian is an important partner for Amazon."" The companies are working on getting 100,000 electric delivery vehicles on the road by 2030.
* Rivian is suing a key supplier of seats, warning that a pricing dispute could hamper production of the electric van ordered by Amazon, The Wall Street Journal reported. Amazon was also an early investor in Rivian, with a roughly 18% stake.
What's Next: Rivian in the first quarter delivered about 1,200 of about 25,000 vehicles it expects to deliver in 2022. Both analysts and management expect production to ramp up, with Wall Street estimates calling for about 2,500 trucks for the current quarter.

Lockdowns in Shanghai Will Finally Ease, Boosting Optimism
Shanghai announced plans to gradually reopen after more than six weeks in Covid-19 lockdowns, which contributed to a slowdown in China's economic activity and disrupted global supply chains.
* Deputy Mayor Zong Ming said on Monday that 15 out of Shanghai's 16 districts had eliminated coronavirus transmission and that the city would carry out a phased reopening with the aim of returning to normal life from June 1.
* Lockdowns in Shanghai and other cities across China have taken a toll on the world's second-biggest economy, with retail sales falling 11.1% year-over-year in April, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics released on Monday. That was a steeper decline than the 6.6% projected fall from economists polled by Bloomberg.
* Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index on Tuesday rallied 3.3% as optimism over the regulatory picture for Chinese tech companies built on the news that Hong Kong would ease Covid-19 curbs this week.
What's Next: Restrictions in China risk a downturn in the world's second-largest economy and ripple effects through the disruption of supply chains, potentially further stoking inflation. The easing of lockdowns in Shanghai is a small step in the right direction.

DETROIT — Tesla CEO Elon Musk gave the strongest hint yet Monday that he would like to pay less for Twitter than his $44 billion offer made last month.
Musk told a Miami technology conference that a viable deal at a lower price would not be out of the question, according to a report by Bloomberg News, which said it viewed a livestream video of the conference posted by a Twitter user.
Also at the All In Summit, Musk estimated that at least 20% of Twitter’s 229 million accounts are spam bots, a percentage he said was at the low end of his assessment, according to the report.
The appearance came a few hours after Musk began trolling Twitter CEO Paraj Agrawal, who posted a series of tweets explaining his company’s effort to fight bots and how it has consistently estimated that less than 5% of accounts are fake.
Twitter shares closed Monday down just over 8% at $37.39, below where the stock was just before Musk disclosed that he was Twitter’s largest shareholder. Musk made the offer to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share on April 14.
Trader Joe’s workers seek union HADLEY, Mass. Employees are seeking to unionize at a Trader Joe’s grocery store in western Massachusetts, joining a nationwide surge of labor organizing among retail and food service workers.
Organizers at the store sent an open letter to company CEO Dan Bane dated Saturday citing concerns about pay, benefits and safety. They asked for a union election ""without interference or obstruction.""
At the start of the pandemic, some Trader Joe’s workers who were concerned about safety discussed organizing. But those efforts ultimately fizzled under pressure from management, who in a letter to workers said that unions ""drive discontent.""
""Since that letter arrived in our mailboxes, Trader Joe’s has continued to slash our benefits, as our wages stagnate and our safety concerns go unaddressed,"" the Hadley workers said in their letter to Bane. ""A union is the only way to protect and improve our pay and benefits. The company’s actions have made this clear.""
Unlimited vacation Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will allow senior staff to take an unlimited number of vacation days, the latest move by a Wall Street bank to retain talent in a heated job market. Partners and managing directors at the New York investment bank can take time off when needed ""without a fixed vacation day entitlement,"" according to a company memo seen by Bloomberg.
Junior employees still have limits on vacation but will be given at least two extra days off each year under the new policy."

Elon Musk isn't pleased.
In a slew of tweets, Mr. Musk, Tesla's chief executive, called ESG "" an outrageous scam ,"" lamented that Exxon Mobil Corp. remained in the index and claimed the company behind the move has "" lost their integrity .""
""Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social & governance (ESG) by S&P 500, while Tesla didn't make the list!"" Mr. Musk, the world's richest person, said on Twitter .
""ESG is a scam,"" he added. ""It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors.""
Exxon wasn't immediately available to comment.
The tweets come after S&P Dow Jones Indices recently removed the electric-vehicle maker and several other companies from its ESG index as part of its yearly rebalancing. In an explanation of the move, the index operator said Tesla lagged its peers for a variety of reasons including its carbon strategy, working conditions and handling of a regulatory investigation.
""While Tesla may be playing its part in taking fuel-powered cars off the road, it has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider ESG lens,"" S&P said in a blog post detailing the index changes.
An S&P spokesman didn't comment on Mr. Musk specifically. ""We would simply reiterate the explanation laid out"" that detailed changes to the index, the spokesman said.
S&P Dow Jones Indices is a joint venture between S&P Global Inc. and CME Group Inc. Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, is not a stakeholder in the venture.
 ESG investing has grown in popularity in recent years as investors look to put their money into more socially conscious companies. At the end of 2021, assets in ESG funds hit $2.74 trillion , Morningstar said. The popular three-letter acronym is a category that encompasses how companies perform in areas like diversity, their impact on the environment and more.
Mr. Musk, who has agreed to buy Twitter for $44 billion but has recently indicated the deal is ""on hold,"" said he thinks ""political attacks on me will escalate dramatically in coming months.""
 In a separate tweet he added that Tesla does ""more for the environment than any company ever!"" The comment included a meme that shows a person asking what an ESG score is, and another responding saying ""it determines how compliant your business is with the leftist agenda.""
Mr. Musk followed that tweet with one saying he now plans to vote Republican after voting for Democrats in the past.
Tesla was the largest company left out of the ESG index when measured by its weighting in the S&P 500. Other companies bumped from the index include Johnson & Johnson and Meta Platforms Inc.
For Tesla specifically, S&P said its lack of a low carbon strategy, claims of racial discrimination, poor working conditions at its Fremont factory and the handling of an investigation by regulators related to injuries and deaths tied to its vehicles.
The changes to the index were effective May 2, according to S&P.

208,18-May-22,The New York Observer,"As Tesla Stock Falters, Elon Musk is Considering Selling SpaceX Shares to Fund His Twitter Deal",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2666065108/BFD812D457A14912PQ/49?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk’s SpaceX is reportedly valued at $125 billion. Britta Pedersen-Pool/Getty Images
Elon Musk appears to be hesitating over his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter as a key funding source, his ownership in Tesla, quickly loses value. Financial activities at his other company, SpaceX, however, suggest the billionaire may be considering cashing out some shares there to pay for Twitter.
Tesla’s share price has tumbled nearly 30 percent since Musk signed an agreement to buy Twitter on April 24. According to his financing plan, Musk will sell $21 billion worth of Tesla stock, about 20 million shares, and borrow the rest to fund the deal. However, with Tesla stock now in the deep of a bear market, selling millions of shares is equivalent to accepting a huge loss. Musk might be eager to find alternatives to cashing out Tesla stock at a deep discount.
Meanwhile, SpaceX’s value is soaring. The rocket company, which is privately held, is looking to raise more than $1 billion in fresh capital at a valuation of $125 billion while some existing shareholders plan to sell their equities via a private placement concurrently, Bloomberg reported on May 17. One of the sellers is Musk, according to The New York Post, citing people familiar with the matter.
Elon Musk’s SpaceX stake is worth $55 billion
SpaceX’s new valuation represents a nearly 70 percent jump in just over a year. It’s not uncommon for highly valued private companies to sell shares in the secondary market to allow early investors to cash out.
SpaceX did not immediately respond to a press inquiry about whether Musk is selling his SpaceX shares. It’s also unclear how many shares are available for sale.
Musk owns 47 percent of SpaceX, according to the company’s Federal Communications Commission disclosure, which SpaceX is required to file because it launches communications satellites. Under the $125 billion valuation, that stake is worth $55 billion, more than enough to pay for the Twitter acquisition.
However, SpaceX’s fundraising campaign is being met with “very tepid demand,” according to The New York Post, as investors carefully evaluate uncertain market conditions.
“No one is paying up for anything in this market,” one of the Post’s sources said.
On the business side, SpaceX’s launch demand is stronger than ever. In 2022 so far, the company has launched 19 crewed and cargo missions, including contracts with NASA and flights delivering its own Starlink satellites. Last year, SpaceX launched 31 mission in total."
209,18-May-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla Got Kicked Out of the S&P 500 ESG Index. Elon Musk Calls ESG a 'Scam.',https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2665601856/BFD812D457A14912PQ/140?accountid=13946,"Tesla no longer qualifies for inclusion in the S&P 500 ESG Index. It's a call that is likely to surprise investors, with the potential for a modest impact on the stock price.
Tesla (ticker: TSLA), a company that CEO Elon Musk says he founded to put the world on a path to a sustainable-energy future, doesn't have a comprehensive low-carbon strategy, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.
""A few of the factors contributing to its 2021 [ESG] Score were a decline in criteria level scores related to Tesla's [lack of a] low carbon strategy and codes of business conduct,"" wrote Maggie Dorn, senior director and head of ESG Indices, North America, at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a blog post.
Tesla, of course, is responsible for shifting the entire car industry toward electric vehicles. Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) are two auto makers spending billions on EVs. Shares of both are in the SPDR S&P 500 ESG exchange-traded fund (EFIV).
Read More: Tesla Stock Price Targets Are Falling as Earnings Estimates Rise 
Driving an EV doesn't eliminate all carbon emissions because electricity can be generated by burning natural gas or coal. But the U.S. now generates about 40% of its electricity from nuclear plants and renewable sources, and that percentage is going up over time.
There were other reasons for Tesla's exclusion, too. ""A Media and Stakeholder Analysis, a process that seeks to identify a company's current and potential future exposure to risks stemming from its involvement in a controversial incident, identified two separate events centered around claims of racial discrimination and poor working conditions at Tesla's Fremont factory, as well as its handling of the NHTSA investigation after multiple deaths and injuries were linked to its autopilot vehicles,"" Dorn wrote.
Tesla certainly would take exception to the safety assertion. The company produces quarterly reports that indicate Teslas compare favorably with other vehicles on some safety metrics. It didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
But Musk doesn't appear happy, tweeting that S&P Global Ratings ""has lost their integrity"" and describing environmental, social, and governance investing as a ""scam.""
""For any element of an ESG score, whether it's the E, S, or G, disclosure is hugely important,"" Ray McConville, an S&P spokesman, told Barron's via email. ""If there isn't a lot of information available, whether its publicly available information or information provided in our Corporate Sustainability Assessment survey, then that would negatively impact a score. So in the case of Tesla and others, the issue is partly a lack of disclosure.""
One thing that might help Tesla is public relations . The auto maker doesn't have an active PR effort.
More to read
Tesla ""needs to invest in PR to improve its safety brand equity which is becoming increasingly important in the minds' of EV customers,"" said Future Fund Active ETF (FFND) co-founder Gary Black . ""Teslas are the safest cars in the world, but EV consumers don't know it.""
Exclusion from an index can matter to a stock because inclusion creates demand. But for Tesla, the ESG exclusion looks minor.

Roughly $65 billion in money is indexed to or benchmarked against the S&P ESG index. That is a lot, but it is relatively small in the asset-management world. The comparable figure for the S&P 500—Tesla is a component—is more than $13 trillion.
Tesla stock closed down 6.8% Wednesday, at $709.81 a share. The index news probably wasn't the reason. The entire market got hammered: The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 4% and 3.6%, respectively. Disappointing results from Target (TGT) were a big reason for the plunge. Target missed earnings estimates and warned inflation was changing consumer behavior and increasing costs. Shares finished down about 25%.
Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter cut his target for Tesla's stock price to $1,035 from $1,260. That also may have weighed on shares a little.

210,18-May-22,The Washington Post,Musk says bots number could scuttle Twitter purchase,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2665377664/BFD812D457A14912PQ/400?accountid=13946,"He says deal 'cannot go forward' until company proves its 5% figure
Elon Musk said Tuesday that his $44 billion bid to buy Twitter ""cannot move forward"" until the social media company can prove no more than 5 percent of its users are fake, seizing on an issue that might enable him to pull out of the deal.
The Tesla chief executive's tweet comes a day after he said he might try to negotiate a lower price and accused Twitter of potentially misleading him about the number of bots on the platform - a clear signal he was seeking an exit.
Musk polled his nearly 94 million followers on whether Twitter's figure was accurate, as he searched for proof for his claim that he was misled.
Despite speculation by some users on Twitter that Musk is running afoul of Securities and Exchange Commission rules by tweeting about the deal, securities experts said he was within his rights to raise the bot question publicly.
""As an investor, there's no prohibition against him speaking publicly about his investment and his intentions unless there's some restriction that may be imposed by virtue of a nondisclosure agreement or some other contractual element associated with the transaction,"" said Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC enforcement lawyer now with the law firm Dickinson Wright.
 Frenkel said the SEC might take an interest if it were determined that Musk's assertions about bots were knowingly false. ""I just don't think there's any evidence of that,"" he added.
Musk also indicated he believes the SEC should investigate the accuracy of Twitter's filings about bot accounts. After a Twitter user suggested an investigation, Musk posted, ""Hello, @SECGov, anyone home?""
Meanwhile, Twitter filed a proxy statement Tuesday requesting that shareholders approve the deal at the $54.20-per-share price Musk offered, saying in a news release that it was ""committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms."" The company has long maintained that bogus accounts amount to 5 percent of Twitter's users, but it also has acknowledged in securities filings that the true number ""could be higher.""
Musk has signaled that his focus on Twitter bots is part of an effort to find a way out of the deal before it closes - without remaining responsible for the agreement already in place.
If Musk can show he was misled about the number of fake accounts, it would give him the option of walking away through a ""material adverse effect"" clause, though legal experts have expressed doubt about the strategy. The terms of the agreement carry a $1 billion termination fee, and his withdrawal could trigger a messy legal battle, some experts have said.
The bots tussle marks the latest curveball in the quest for the influential social media platform, where Musk's 93.7 million followers make him one of the site's most popular users.
At a conference in Miami on Monday, Musk said buying Twitter at a lower price was not ""out of the question,"" an indication that he was distancing himself from the $44 billion offer announced April 25.
Tesla shares, a major source of Musk's massive wealth, have dropped more than 30 percent since Musk first disclosed his minority ownership in Twitter in April, wiping roughly $300 billion off the EV maker's market capitalization, according to Dan Ives, managing director of Wedbush Securities. Though he's still the world's richest man by Bloomberg estimates, his $213 billion fortune is down nearly $57 billion from the start of the year.
The deal has heaped pressure on Tesla's stock in a risky market environment, Ives said, and that in concert with other financing factors has ""caused Musk to get cold feet."" He noted that the bot question is not new but rather is probably ""more of a scapegoat to push for a lower price.""
""The stark reality for Twitter is that no other strategic/financial bidder will come near this deal and Musk knows that,"" Ives said in commentary Tuesday.
Twitter's stock has already given up all the gains it made in light of the deal, sliding more than 8 percent Monday before recovering about 2.5 percent Tuesday.
""If the merger is not completed, and depending on the circumstances that cause the merger not to be completed, the price of our common stock may decline significantly,"" Twitter warned in the proxy statement.
Tesla's shares climbed about 5 percent Tuesday.
The issue of bots - accounts that often peddle cryptocurrency scams or other schemes - prompted Musk to declare the deal on hold last week.
In a thread on Twitter's methodology, chief executive Parag Agrawal said Monday that the site suspends more than 500,000 spam accounts daily. He said its estimate of bots is based on reviews, conducted by people quarterly, of thousands of accounts that it counts as active and that are randomly sampled.
Musk responded to the thread with a poop emoji.
Musk said at Monday's conference that he thought the proportion of bots is higher than what Twitter has announced.
""It's a material adverse misstatement if they, in fact, have been vociferously claiming less than 5 percent of fake or spam accounts but in fact it is four or five times that number,"" he said. ""This is a big deal.""
The comments appear to refer to a contract clause that could allow him to back out in case of an occurrence that significantly changes the business.
To fund his push to take Twitter private, Musk had committed billions of dollars of his net worth, which the Bloomberg Billionaires Index estimates to be $213 billion. More recently, as the value of Tesla and other tech stocks plummeted, he sought more investors to lower his equity commitment in the deal, The Washington Post has reported.
Musk has said he wants to remove bot accounts after acquiring the company and promote ""free speech"" on Twitter, a view some employees worry could hurt safety policies put in place to protect users online. Musk's plans include restoring the account of former president Donald Trump, who was banned after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Last week, Agrawal announced a hiring freeze for Twitter and fired the company's heads of revenue and consumer product. In a memo to employees first reported by the Verge, Agrawal, who has called himself a ""lame duck CEO"" amid Musk's bid, cited a ""less favorable"" global economic backdrop and said the company had failed to hit ""intermediate milestones"" for audience and revenue goals it laid out at the pandemic's nascency.
""And, of course, we are in the middle of an acquisition and we don't yet know the timing of the close,"" Agrawal noted in the memo. ""In order to responsibly manage the organization as we sharpen our roadmaps and our work, we need to continue to be intentional about our teams, hiring and costs.""

211,18-May-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Is Elon Musk Actually Going to Buy Twitter? Can He Just Walk Away? Here are Musk's options should he try to abandon the $44 billion deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2665601857/BFD812D457A14912PQ/422?accountid=13946,"There are signs Elon Musk may be getting cold feet a few weeks after he agreed to buy Twitter Inc. for $44 billion.
The billionaire Tesla Inc. chief executive recently tweeted that the deal is ""on hold"" until he gets more information about the portion of the social-media platform's users that are spam accounts . Twitter has for years said in filings that it estimates they represent less than 5% of its daily active users, though has cautioned the number could be higher.
This is all happening as technology shares—including those of Tesla, which Mr. Musk is relying on to fund the deal— have been under pressure . Twitter's board, meanwhile, says it intends to enforce the agreement, which calls for him to pay $54.20 a share.
Here's what to know about how things could play out.
Can either side walk away at any time?
Not easily. Both sides signed a merger agreement, a detailed document stipulating exactly what each will do to ensure the agreed-upon deal closes, and what legal rights each has if the other doesn't hold up its end of the bargain. It is similar to going under contract on a house.
In this case, Mr. Musk was motivated to quickly negotiate a deal, and in doing so, agreed to a contract with several seller-friendly components. For example, he waived the detailed due diligence that buyers typically perform on targets (think of it like skipping a home inspection), and gave Twitter the right to sue him to follow through with the deal, a legal clause known as ""specific performance.""
Both sides also agreed to pay each other a $1 billion breakup fee if they cause the deal not to happen for certain reasons, but specific scenarios must unfold for those to become relevant. Also called termination fees, the penalties are meant to deter parties from breaking agreements and address the inconvenience and cost of a failed deal.
Can Mr. Musk just pay Twitter the $1 billion breakup fee to get out of the deal?
Not necessarily. There are three clear scenarios in which this could happen, and possibly more. If regulators try to block the deal or the debt financing falls through, he would likely have an out. The third is if he can show Twitter has significantly changed for the worse since the deal was agreed upon, under a concept known as a ""material adverse effect.""
If Mr. Musk believes Twitter's accounting of spam accounts was inaccurate when he signed the deal, his lawyers could attempt to litigate that issue in various ways, including as a material adverse effect, or possibly by alleging that Twitter misrepresented information in its filings. It is unclear whether they would succeed, though it could open the door to settlement discussions.
What will Twitter do?
Twitter's board feels strongly that the two sides had an agreement that remains in effect and is the best option for shareholders. ""We intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement,"" it said.
For that reason, Twitter appears willing to sue for specific performance if it comes to that, meaning it could try to force Mr. Musk to follow through with the deal or provide what it sees as fair compensation. In practice, that can be difficult but often opens the door to settlement discussions.
The agreement between the two sides also requires Mr. Musk to avoid disparaging Twitter and its representatives on the platform and his recent tweets could have crossed that line . While Twitter could challenge the behavior, it appears more focused at the moment on closing the deal rather than launching relatively minor litigation that could run the risk of complicating things further.
 Photos: How Elon Musk Made the Fortune He Will Need to Buy Twitter 
What is going to happen?
It is too early to say. The deal could still happen, and could close as soon as this summer if both sides keep moving forward. Another possible outcome is that the two sides negotiate a settlement, especially if it becomes clear that Mr. Musk is intent on getting out of the deal or trying to lower the price.
Even when contract terms are clearly spelled out, more often than not deal clashes end in negotiated settlements that can include a price cut or one-time payments.
In 2020, luxury-goods conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE tried to back out of a deal to buy Tiffany & Co. for $16.2 billion after the pandemic hurt demand for high-end jewelry. Tiffany sued to enforce the agreement and LVMH countersued, arguing the business had been so deeply damaged that their original agreement was no longer valid.
The two sides later agreed to cut the price by a relatively modest $430 million and settle related litigation.

But the decision to eject the world's largest maker of electric vehicles from a club that includes oil producers like Exxon Mobil attracted little notice until S&P Global, which manages the index, offered an explanation this week.S&P cited claims of racial discrimination and poor working conditions at Tesla's factory in Fremont, Calif.. Those claims have prompted a California state agency to file a lawsuit, which Tesla is contesting. S&P said its decision was also influenced by Tesla's handling of an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after multiple deaths and injuries were linked to the company's driver-assistance system, known as Autopilot.""While Tesla may be playing its part in taking fuel-powered cars off the road, it has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider E.S.G. lens,"" Margaret Dorn, head of E.S.G. indices in North America at S&P, said in the firm's explanation.Tesla stock was the fourth most heavily weighted in the index before it was removed, behind Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. Funds that track the index were obligated to own Tesla shares when it joined the index in May 2021 and to sell them when it was booted off.Exxon Mobil is the ninth most heavily weighted stock in the index, prompting a blast from Mr. Musk. ""Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social & governance (ESG) by S&P 500, while Tesla didn't make the list!"" he wrote on Twitter. ""ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors.""S&P did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why Exxon made the list and Tesla didn't.Tesla has previously faced criticism from investors who say it has released little information about the impact of its manufacturing or labor practices.""Elon has branded himself and the entire company on the importance of environmental sustainability,"" said Kristin Hull, the founder and chief executive of Nia Impact Capital, a fund in Oakland, Calif., that invests in companies with a positive social impact. Yet, Dr. Hull added, Tesla has been stingy with information about its water use or how it sources materials used in batteries.""You can't have a racial equity lawsuit and be considered a top E.S.G. name,"" she added.Passive index funds, which collectively direct about a third of all the assets invested in the stock market, are required to match their portfolios to the index they track. Getting included in or removed from an index can impact a company's stock price. General Electric's shares, for instance, fell 3 percent shortly after it was announced in mid-2018 that the company, an original member of the Dow Jones industrial average, was being removed from that index.But the drop in Tesla's share price of more than 30 percent since the end of March was more likely the result of concern about Mr. Musk's offer to buy Twitter and a broader shift in how investors view technology stocks.S&P reported that there were $65 billion in assets invested in funds tied to its E.S.G. index at the end of December 2020, the most recently available figure. That's far smaller than the $13 trillion that is in funds tied to the more widely followed S&P 500 index, of which Tesla remains a member. That $65 billion is also small compared to Tesla's overall market value of nearly $750 billion. And only a portion of the holdings of those E.S.G. funds are in Tesla.What's more, of the $65 billion tied to the E.S.G. index, only $11 billion of that money is invested in passive index funds, which would be required to sell their Tesla stakes. The rest of the money is in funds that benchmark their performance against the S&P 500 E.S.G. index. Many of those funds are actively managed by portfolio managers. Those funds aren't required to sell their Tesla holdings, but they might do so in order to not deviate too far from the index that they are compared to by investors.""Tesla is just simply not an open-and-shut E.S.G. case,"" said Jon Hale, who directs sustainability research at mutual fund tracking firm Morningstar. ""While it's clear the company's product is beneficial to the environment, Tesla is now a big company and it also has an impact on employees and customers, and those issues concern E.S.G. investors.""Several other prominent companies were also dropped from the index in April when S&P determined they no longer met the criteria for membership. They included Chevron, Delta Air Lines, Home Depot and News Corp.Even if ejections do not impact the value of a company's shares, they could have an impact on a company's actions. ""Elon Musk and Tesla may be the exception,"" Mr. Hale said. ""But the flip side of that is very few companies want to be E.S.G. laggards in the current environment.""PhotographCalifornia has sued Tesla over claims of racial bias at its factory in Fremont.

213,19-May-22,Los Angeles Times,BUSINESS; Musk switches to GOP as fortune shrinks,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2666229647/BFD812D457A14912PQ/433?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk spent Wednesday on Twitter, announcing his switch from Democrat to Republican, trashing a socially conscious investing trend and replying to users of the social media website he's agreed to buy.
The world's richest man declared in a tweet Wednesday that he is switching to the GOP.
""In the past I voted Democrat, because they were (mostly) the kindness party,"" he wrote. ""But they have become the party of division & hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican.""

The tweet followed comments this week in which he lobbed criticism at President Biden's administration, saying that it ""doesn't get a lot done."" Musk has also expressed dismay at Biden's reluctance to acknowledge Tesla's prominence in the electric vehicle industry; Tesla was not invited to an August 2021 event at the White House promoting electric vehicles.
Musk has donated to candidates and political committees of both parties, but his giving has leaned more to Republicans in the last year.
He has used his massive Twitter following to attack Democratic lawmakers, including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden of Oregon, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, all of whom have advocated higher taxes on billionaires.
Since announcing his bid to buy Twitter and promise to make it more of a ""free speech"" platform -- including restoring access to former President Trump -- Musk has become something of a hero for segments of the Republican Party. Conservatives praised his $44-billion bid to take Twitter private, saying he would eliminate the biases they contend social media companies have against them.
GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, who represents Musk's new home state of Texas, tweeted last month that Musk's purchase of Twitter ""is the most important development for free speech in decades.""
Musk said that it was ""flat out stupid"" for the platform to ban Trump after his supporters raided the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
Also on Wednesday, Musk tweeted that environmental, social and governance investing, or ESG, was ""a scam"" after Tesla lost its spot on an S&P Global index that tracks companies on their ESG standards. He also predicted that ""political attacks"" on him would ""escalate dramatically in coming months.""
Tesla shares, meanwhile, sank to their lowest level this year, wiping $12.3 billion from his wealth, while Twitter extended its slide.
All told, Musk has lost $49 billion since launching his bid for Twitter, partly as the market tumbled and as some investors in Tesla grew concerned over how he'd fund his offer for the social media giant. Recently, Musk has said the deal is ""on hold"" while he confirms Twitter's internal data on the prevalence of bots.
He's still the world's richest person, with a fortune of $209.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He's had $60.4 billion shaved off his wealth this year, trailing Binance Chief Executive Changpeng Zhao, whose net worth is down $81 billion, and Jeff Bezos, whose fortune fell $6 billion.

214,19-May-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Some Suspect Musk of Spam Exit Ploy,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2666303386/BFD812D457A14912PQ/471?accountid=13946,"In the classic hostile takeover, an aggressive acquirer pursues a reluctant quarry.
But Elon Musk's bid for Twitter Inc. appears headed to a bizarre place: Could Twitter force him to buy a company he might not actually want?
Whether smokescreen, negotiating tactic, genuine concern or flight of fancy, Mr. Musk's insistence that Twitter is overrun by spam bots has upended a deal that was eccentric from the outset and left both sides in difficult positions.
Twitter shares continue to slide, and they fell nearly 4% Wednesday to $36.85 in a broad stock selloff, a sign that investors no longer believe that Mr. Musk's cash offer of $54.20 a share -- now 47% above market price -- will stand. For Twitter's board, securing that price would be a victory, and it said it intends to close the deal and enforce the merger agreement.
Its other options seem few. Twitter makes about 90% of its revenue from digital advertising, a slumping market. Chief Executive Parag Agrawal, who has described himself as a lame duck, has announced a hiring freeze and spending cuts to employees and signaled more changes may be ahead. Several high-ranking executives have recently left.
Mr. Musk, for his part, while still the world's richest person, has gotten considerably poorer: Tesla Inc. shares, which are the bulk of his fortune, have fallen 31% since he offered to buy Twitter. He has sold about $8.5 billion in Tesla shares and needs to borrow against more to fund the deal. Getting out of spending $44 billion on a social-media company would take pressure off his finances.
Mr. Musk's insistence that Twitter provide more information on spam bots has been particularly suspicious because of his history on the issue. He has been well aware of it for years -- tweeting about it at least as early as 2018 -- and he said in the days immediately before and after he struck the deal with Twitter that part of his goal was to ""defeat the spam bots"" and ""clear out bots, spam & scams.""
Twitter's own estimate that such accounts represent fewer than 5% of its monetizable daily users has been in its regulatory filings for years. Yet Mr. Musk never brought his concerns up as part of deal negotiations with Twitter, according to people familiar with the matter and a detailed account of the talks in a Twitter proxy filing on Tuesday -- and he waived the detailed due diligence that buyers typically perform on targets before closing.
A deal is usually a deal. The buyer and the seller sign a contract stipulating what each side will do to ensure it is completed, and what legal rights each has if the other doesn't hold up its end of the bargain. But nothing is usual with Mr. Musk.
He filed forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission asserting that he had only a passive interest in Twitter shares when -- in Twitter's account -- he had days before told Twitter he was thinking of taking the company over.
His forms were late. He agreed to join Twitter's board and then didn't.
Lawyers say the contract provides Mr. Musk few ways to back out. One is if the banks who agreed to finance the deal fail to lend him the money.
Another is if regulators block the deal. A third is if Twitter has changed significantly for the worse since the deal was signed, a concept known as a ""material adverse effect.""
What's more, Mr. Musk negotiated fast and agreed to a contract with several seller-friendly features. One gives Twitter the right to ask a court to make him follow through with the deal, a legal clause called ""specific performance.""
""The agreement doesn't really give a clean exit,"" said Andrew Freedman, a partner at Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP.
But suing Mr. Musk, who has 94 million Twitter followers, isn't simple either. Seeking specific performance means asking a Delaware judge to force him to go through with the purchase.
Lawyers say specific performance is a difficult remedy to win at trial and often specific-performance claims are preludes to negotiations or settlements.

215,19-May-22,The Times - Tribune,Uh-oh: Elon Musk emulates Henry Ford,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2715430231/BFD812D457A14912PQ/476?accountid=13946,"As Elon Musk tries to add Twitter to his expanding empire, he’s seeming a bit busy. When he’s not starting and buying complex companies, he’s sounding off about free speech, cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence and, well, just about everything.
The electric-car magnate is developing an eerie resemblance to another automotive visionary: Henry Ford. That’s not meant as a compliment. If Musk keeps courting celebrity and pursuing side ventures, the risk is that Tesla, will fall from its premier position just as Ford Motor Co. did in the 1920s.
Henry Ford famously parlayed visionary ideas about assembly-line manufacturing into unimaginable wealth and global fame. His headline-grabbing initiatives — paying his workers the princely sum of $5 a day, for example — made him an American folk hero, someone whose quest for market share and profit nonetheless held out the promise of a better life for all.
This adulation drove a transformation in Ford’s personality. Like Musk, Ford was originally a shy, awkward man. But as his business ventures made him a celebrity after 1910, he underwent a metamorphosis that foreshadowed Musk’s own transformation from tongue-tied savant to global guru.
Samuel Marquis, a friend of Ford’s, once recounted how the automaker “suddenly faced about, hired a publicity agent and jumped into the front page of every newspaper in the country.” Ford’s new philosophy, Marquis noted, boiled down to a belief that “it is a good thing to keep people talking about him, no matter what they say.”
There was plenty to say. In a side project launched in 1921, Ford proposed to lease the government-owned Wilson Dam on the Tennessee River. A longstanding proponent of hydroelectric power, Ford hoped to turn a large swath of dirt-poor Alabama known as Muscle Shoals into a hydro-powered industrial metropolis the size of Detroit.
He proposed to underwrite the business with a new techno-currency: the “energy dollar,” which would be backed by electricity generated by the river. By the time the plan fell apart, Ford was contemplating another modest project: a run for the U.S. presidency.
His wife nixed that idea. But the “Sage of Dearborn” started other ventures. He moved into the manufacture of airplanes and launched the nation’s first commercial airline in 1925. He started educational initiatives, including the Henry Ford Trade School.
He also started a sprawling historical museum in his hometown of Dearborn, Michigan. By the time it finally opened in the Great Depression, Ford had sunk today’s equivalent of a billion dollars into what was little more than a warehouse bulging with things that reminded Ford of his childhood.
He purchased a failing newspaper known as the Dearborn Independent, turning it into a national paper distributed through his dealerships. It featured columns that ghostwriters churned out under Ford’s name. It also published a horrific series of antisemitic screeds published as “The International Jew.” The addled conspiracy theories that appeared there attracted the admiration of Adolf Hitler.
Lost in all the celebrity and controversy was Ford’s iconic company. As he became ever more convinced of his own infallibility, Ford drove away many of his most capable lieutenants and engineers, replacing them with sycophants. He even sidelined his own son, Edsel, who correctly anticipated many of the challenges facing the company.
Ford had become someone who “would rather be a maker of public opinion than the manufacturer of a million vehicles a year,” Marquis observed.
Ford’s dethroning began with the arrival of Alfred P. Sloan, an engineer trained at MIT who by 1923 had gradually assumed control of a motley assortment of car companies known as General Motors.
Sloan was ruthless and calculating, using financial statistics to cut costs and foster efficiency. The language he used, one management theorist later observed, was as “cold as the steel he caused to be bent to form cars: economizing, utility, facts, objectivity, systems, rationality, maximizing — that is the stuff of his vocabulary.” He looked the part, too.
Sloan had no interest in being a public figure. He simply wished to usurp Ford. He began by bringing order to his own corporate empire. Instead of Ford’s singular Model T, General Motors had a “car for every purse and purpose,” as one advertisement put it. Sloan gave the executives in charge of different divisions — Chevrolet, Buick, Cadillac and so forth — enough latitude to run their own ships, but otherwise centralized management.
The differences multiplied. In the 1920s, Ford pursued a strategy of vertical integration, buying mines and forests to give him a steady supply of raw materials. (Musk has embarked on similar ventures.) Sloan opted for a more flexible reliance on suppliers that freed up capital to pursue the investments behind the strategy of market segmentation and planned obsolescence.
While Ford spent a fortune building Fordlandia, a bizarre utopian city in the Brazilian rainforest designed to oversee rubber production, Sloan focused on affordable and stylish cars. While Ford kept expecting buyers to pay cash, Sloan pioneered financing.
In 1929, General Motors became the world’s biggest car manufacturer. Though Henry Ford tried to stage a comeback with the Model A, it was too late: General Motors widened its lead during the Great Depression. Only when Ford’s grandson took over at the end of World War II and hired top managers did the company’s fortunes turn around.
In the case of Tesla, history is breathing down Musk’s neck. The automaker best positioned to overtake Tesla as the premier manufacturer of electric vehicles could be Ford, which is gearing up to beat Musk at his own game.
Today’s Ford executives don’t have tens of millions of Twitter followers. They’re not household names. They don’t have grand plans to transform the world.
In other words, they’re not at all like Henry Ford. And that spells trouble for Ford’s modern-day incarnation, Elon Musk."
216,19-May-22,The Washington Post,Elon Musk's incessant trolling could sabotage Twitter deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2666122642/BFD812D457A14912PQ/543?accountid=13946,"Needling of platform has lowered stock prices and alarmed employees
Billionaire Elon Musk fired off yet another tweet Tuesday potentially sabotaging his $44 billion bid to buy Twitter. His scorched-earth campaign may also be sabotaging Twitter itself.
For weeks, Musk has needled the social media company on its own platform, driving down its stock price and alarming employees who live in fear of being attacked by Musk's legions of online followers. Rank-and-file workers are polishing their résumés, saying they can't get straight answers to basic questions, such as whether there would be layoffs, whether there would be a board of directors after the acquisition, and whether Musk would change the company's content moderation policies. Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal's firing of top executives and reduction in hiring have added to the sense of chaos.
Twitter has seen its share of disruption in 16 years, from absentee leaders to employee uprisings. But over the past six weeks, Musk has brought next-level dysfunction to the company's San Francisco headquarters and beyond.
The impression among employees is that Musk is messing with Twitter ""like a dog playing with a toy,"" said a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. ""No matter what: The company is in play now. I don't think it's a situation where Elon walks away and things can go back to normal.""
Twitter's stock price has slumped 25 percent over the past two weeks, already far below the $54.20 a share Musk offered and way off its high of $77.06 in February 2021. Employees and Twitter investors fear that if Musk walks away, the company - long a coveted bauble for Silicon Valley's billionaire class because it is the Internet's town square - would be left battered and exposed. It would have a weakened CEO and board, vacancies in its executive ranks, and a low share price in a shaky market. But some employees also worry it would be easy prey for another buyer who could further damage its reputation.
Prominent conservatives - enthusiastic about Musk's absolutist stance on free speech - are already gaining followers since Twitter accepted his offer, according to a Washington Post analysis, while some liberals are losing their audience. The trend suggests that if Musk or a future buyer bends the platform to his or her political will, it could drive Twitter into irrelevance by sapping its mass-market appeal.
""I don't see how you come out a winner either way, except to make Twitter unusable,"" said Joan Donovan, research director of the Technology and Social Change Research Project at Harvard University's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.
Twitter's board issued a statement Tuesday indicating that it had no willingness to renegotiate with Musk.
""The Board and Mr. Musk agreed to a transaction at $54.20 per share. We believe this agreement is in the best interest of all shareholders. We intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement,"" the statement said.
Twitter declined to comment on the impact of Musk's actions. A person familiar with negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe ongoing deliberations, said the board's attitude was that Musk's campaign could come back to bite him because it risked damaging an asset he would eventually own.
Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Over the past 16 years, Twitter has emerged as one of the biggest and most influential social media platforms on the planet, with 229 million daily users. Moderators have gotten better at weeding out false information related to elections or the coronavirus and at protecting people from the worst types of harassment. But, like other big platforms, it is still used to amplify misinformation, and it can foster an atmosphere of bullying - one that Musk seems to enjoy participating in. It has also struggled to increase its revenue and user base.
Musk says he has grand plans to grow Twitter's business. But his motives - especially as he also runs Tesla, a much bigger and more valuable company - remain opaque even as he tweets incessantly about the deal. On Friday, he pronounced it ""temporarily on hold,"" citing concerns about Twitter's claim that less than 5 percent of its users are fake accounts, known as bots. Two hours later, he said he was still ""committed to acquisition.""
But on Monday, Musk tweeted a poop emoji at Agrawal after the Twitter CEO penned a lengthy thread on the nature of bots and Twitter's efforts to control them. Early Tuesday, Musk declared that the deal ""cannot move forward"" until Twitter shows ""proof of <5%.""
Investors and other Silicon Valley observers speculate that Musk is undercutting Twitter to drive down its share price, and Musk said at a conference Monday that he might try to renegotiate the deal. To purchase Twitter, he plans to take out a multibillion-dollar loan against his assets such as Tesla stock, which has fallen in value recently. He also signaled that he might pull out entirely.
Analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said Musk has ""cold feet"" and is using ""the bot issue as a scapegoat to get out of the Twitter deal.""
He said the board would be under significant pressure to renegotiate. ""There is a zero percent chance the deal price will stay the same, based on where the stock is trading right now,"" he said.
The gamesmanship has left Twitter executives on edge and divided about how to respond. Some are itching to fire back at Musk on Twitter, but others argue that ""it's not productive to engage publicly,"" according to another person familiar with the discussions about the deal, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
The company's usually prolific main account, @Twitter, hasn't tweeted since April 1 - three days before Musk disclosed that he had acquired a sizable stake in the company.
""It's difficult to have a meaningful dialogue against a troll with 80 million baby trolls following him,"" one of the people said. On Tuesday, Musk's following - which has also grown by roughly 15 percent since he announced his interests in the company - stood at nearly 94 million.
Meanwhile, swaths of Twitter's 7,500-person workforce are wavering between getting ready to leave the company and gearing up for battle, according to interviews with six current and former employees, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs or antagonizing their former employer. Some struggle simply to make it through to the next day.
On Monday, Twitter provided documentation to the Securities and Exchange Commission with more details about the deal, as well as a Q&A with commonly asked questions. But the answers said that Twitter employees were expected to carry on as if things were normal: The document used the phrase ""business as usual"" nine times.
Last week, Agrawal unexpectedly fired two long-standing senior executives, including one he had promoted as recently as December. In a companywide email obtained by The Washington Post, Agrawal said the immediate departures of Kayvon Beykpour and Bruce Falck, who oversaw Twitter's consumer and revenue products, were the result of the company needing to manage costs.
Three more senior executives - Vice Presidents Ilya Brown and Katrina Lane, and Max Schmeiser, head of data science - announced their departures on Tuesday, the company confirmed. Bloomberg News first reported the departures.
""Just when you think no more wheels can fall off!"" one of the former Twitter employees told The Post in reaction to the latest news.
Musk's trolling of Twitter has gone on for months. He has questioned the company's free speech practices, tweeted a meme critical of a Twitter executive, Vijaya Gadde, and polled his followers on whether Twitter should introduce an edit button for tweets. He has told his followers that they are being ""manipulated by [Twitter's] algorithm in ways you don't realize.""
His latest focus, on how many of its users are bots, is a sensitive subject for a social media company with a history of being manipulated by Russian trolls. The issue is a long-standing concern for Twitter, but the 5 percent number is standard across the industry. Twitter has been reporting the same figure for years - as has Facebook - despite Musk's tweets suggesting that the issue was new to him.
After Musk's Friday tweets about bots, he tweeted over the weekend that Twitter's legal department had called him to complain. By Monday, Agrawal tried to tamp down the problem. ""We suspend over half a million spam accounts every day, usually before any of you even see them on Twitter. We also lock millions of accounts each week that we suspect may be spam - if they can't pass human verification challenges (captchas, phone verification, etc),"" he tweeted.
But clearing out fake accounts is complicated, he wrote, because the most dangerous ones often look real. Meanwhile, ""many accounts which look fake superficially - are actually real people"" who don't deserve to be suspended or deleted.
His earnest and technocratic explanation of the company's methods for handling fake accounts failed to satisfy Musk and his followers. In addition to the poop emoji, Musk tweeted: ""Have you tried just calling them."" On Tuesday, he followed up by polling his users over whether their experience lined up with Twitter's claims.
Some Twitter workers are cheering Musk on, and many say that if an employee exodus occurs, other engineers will want to join because they are enthralled with Musk's reputation as an innovator. For now, the situation has gotten so tense that at least two senior executives have personal security details, according to one of the people familiar with the situation.
Other employees wonder what purpose Musk's attacks serve. Even though he appears destructive, they ask why he would want to destroy a service that he relies on as his main marketing tool and that he would be responsible for if the deal continues.
Harvard's Donovan said she believes that Musk's strong ideological views, including his opposition to mainstream media and his stated disagreement over Twitter's decision to ban former president Donald Trump, motivate him as much as his financial interests. The more he tweets, the more he can push people who disagree with him out of the company - before he becomes a formal owner. The blanker the canvas, the easier it becomes for Musk and his co-investors to mold the platform to suit their agendas and interests, she said.
""I don't see a viable business model where anyone makes back $44 billion,"" she said. ""But in terms of politics, culture and the economy, Twitter is an incredible influential space - and the value of that may be priceless.""

Fixing the social media company wouldn't be rocket science.
Musk took to Twitter (ticker: TWTR) Thursday evening, perhaps to reassure Tesla (TSLA) investor about the planned deal, saying that Twitter won't take up too much of his time. ""I'm spending
Musk, of course, knows something about rocket science. He runs SpaceX, the privately held aerospace company that pioneered reusable rockets.
Tesla stock was up 2% in premarket trading Friday. Musk's post on Twitter might explain part of the move. Tesla investors have been worried about management distraction since Musk's initial Twitter stake was disclosed in early April. Tesla stock is down about 38% since then. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are off 15% and 22%, respectively.
""While the Twitter situation in theory does not impact the Tesla fundamental story, the distraction risks for Musk (perception is reality) are hard to ignore,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives on Thursday. The Twitter bid comes ""at a time that the Tesla ecosystem have never needed Musk more with the worst supply chain crisis seen in modern history.""
Neither Tesla nor SpaceX immediately responded to a request for comment.
The overall market is stronger Friday. That obscures just how much benefit Tesla shares are deriving from Musk's Twitter. S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up about 1% and 0.8%, respectively.
Tesla stock is more volatile than the market. It tends to rise faster when things are going well and fall harder when investor fears rise.
Musk told investors, on Twitter, recently that the Twitter purchase was on hold pending his investigation into the issue of spam bots. Twitter believes spam accounts make up about 5% of daily active usage. Musk believes the number is far higher and said as much on a podcast earlier this week.
Investors don't seem to have a feel for how the Twitter-Musk saga will turn out. Future Fund Active ETF (FFND) co-founder Gary Black ran a poll on Twitter and found that while some 16% of respondent said they would wait and see the survey results, about 10% of active respondents, those who made a call, think the Twitter purchase will happen at the original $54.20 price. Some 40% of active respondents believe a lower price is coming and 50% think Musk will walk away.
Almost 10,000 people voted in the poll. About half think a deal happens. The other half doesn't. Tesla is the largest position in the Future Fund.
Coming into Friday trading, Tesla stock is off about 33% year to date. The Musk-related drama might be a part of that, but automotive stocks have been hurt by investor fears over inflation and rising interest rates. General Motors (GM) stock, for instance, is down about 38% year to date.

218,20-May-22,The New York Observer,Tesla is Kicked Off an Index For Socially Responsible Companies While Exxon Remains,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2667077076/BFD812D457A14912PQ/220?accountid=13946,"Tesla is a bigger air polluter than Exxon Mobile and Marathon Petroleum, according to a study. Nathan Stirk/Getty Images
Investors care about the ESG (environmental, social and governance) profiles of large corporations more than ever. In 2019, S&P Global, the ratings firm behind the S&P 500 Index, introduced a new benchmark called the S&P 500 ESG Index, a weighted selection of about 300 public companies the firm believes have achieved a good balance between financial return and sustainability performance.
One would think Tesla, the world’s largest electric vehicle maker, would easily make the list and it did for several years. But not any more. In April, S&P decided to exclude the company from its ESG Index after an annual re-balancing. Meanwhile, the firm assigned a higher ESG score to Exxon Mobil, the largest oil and gas producer in the U.S., and included it in this year’s index.
S&P isn’t the only third-party organization with this view. In environmental index compiled by the University of Massachusetts last year, Tesla was ranked as a bigger air polluter than Exxon Mobil and Marathon Petroleum.
As ESG investing becomes a multi-trillion segment of the financial market, there is growing skepticism about how ESG funds select portfolio companies. Along with oil producers, weapon manufacturers and tobacco companies are still included in some ESG funds, although fund managers having been reducing exposure to these industries.
Is Exxon Mobil more green than Tesla?
The University of Massachusetts’ 2021 Toxic Air Polluters Index, which ranks 100 large corporations by the amount of air pollution using 2019 data (the most recent available), placed Tesla at 22, higher than Exxon Mobil (26) and Marathon Petroleum (28). The vast majority of Tesla’s air pollution stems from battery production at the company’s Nevada factory, according to researchers.
The S&P’s issue with Tesla is more social than environmental. In a blog post on May 17 explaining the re-balancing, the ratings firm cited Tesla’s “lack of a low-carbon strategy” and “codes of business conduct” as main reasons for rejection.
Specifically, S&P took issue with claims of racial discrimination and poor working conditions reported at Tesla’s Fremont, Calif. factory, as well as the company’s handling of an investigation by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) regarding the safety of its driver-assistant system.
“While Tesla may be playing its part in taking fuel-powered cars off the road, it has fallen behind its peers when examined through a wider ESG lens,” wrote Margaret Dorn, S&P’s head of ESG Indices in North America, in the post. S&P didn’t explain in its blog post why Exxon is included in this year’s ESG index.
Also kicked off the index this year are Meta, Berkshire Hathaway, and Exxon’s rival, Chevron Corporation. S&P Global didn’t respond to a press inquiry why Exxon made the list while Chevron, Meta and Berkshire Hathaway didn’t.
The ESG Index’s methodology page lists a complex of selection criteria, including the type of business activity a company is engaged in, its financial performance, environmental impact, media reports, and how it treats stakeholders beyond shareholders including customers, employees and business partners.
The debate over how ESG is measured
S&P’s reshuffling of ESG companies prompted a blast from Tesla CEO Elon Musk. “ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors,” he tweeted on May 18.
Musk isn’t alone in questioning S&P’s scoring system. “All the top companies on the ‘rebalanced’ ESG Index list have been subject to discrimination issues and government probes,” said Rashida Salahuddin, president of the Corporate Citizenship Project, a consulting firm advising public companies on governance and ESG matters.
“The decision to remove Tesla is an illustration of how arbitrary and flawed the ESG rating and indexing system has become,” Salahuddin added.
Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social & governance (ESG) by S&P 500, while Tesla didn’t make the list!
ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 18, 2022
In its 2021 Impact Report released in early May, Tesla said current ESG reporting focuses too much on a company’s risk/return profile and not enough on social and environmental impact. “Individual investors—who entrust their money to ESG funds of large investment institutions—are perhaps unaware that their money can be used to buy shares of companies that make climate change worse, not better,” the report says."

And the tumble has called attention to the risks that the company faces. These include increasing competition, a dearth of new products, lawsuits accusing the company of racial discrimination and significant production problems at Tesla's factory in Shanghai, which it uses to supply Asia and Europe.Mr. Musk has not helped the stock price by turning his bid to buy Twitter into a financial soap opera. His antics have reinforced the perception that Tesla lacks an independent board of directors that could stop him from doing things that might damage the company's business and brand.""From a corporate good governance perspective Tesla has a lot of red flags,"" said Andrew Poreda, a senior analyst who specializes in socially responsible investing at Sage Advisory Services, an investment firm in Austin, Texas. ""There are almost no checks and balances.""Even longtime Tesla optimists are having doubts. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, has been one of the most steadfast believers in Tesla on Wall Street. But on Thursday, Wedbush lowered its target price for Tesla -- the firm's estimate of the shares' fair market value based on future earnings -- to $1,000 from $1,400. Mr. Ives cited Tesla's problems in China, where lockdowns have throttled the supply of crucial parts and materials and demand for cars.""There's a new reality for Tesla in China, and the market is reassessing the risks,"" Mr. Ives said.Production problems in China have undercut one of the rationales for making Tesla the world's most valuable car company. Tesla vehicles have been a hit with Chinese buyers, fueling hopes of supercharged growth in the world's largest car market. Tesla's market share in China topped 2.5 percent in the first quarter of 2022, closing in on luxury carmakers Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi.But supply chain headaches in China are compounded by flagging consumer demand, said Michael Dunne, chief executive of ZoZoGo, which advises companies on the electric car market.Chinese consumers ""are edgy, they're worried about the future,"" Mr. Dunne said. ""It's a double whammy that Tesla confronts in China.""Tesla shares are reacting in part to the same forces that are roiling stock markets around the world: war in Ukraine, rising interest rates, the threat of recession, supply chain chaos and surging inflation. But Tesla shares have fallen much more than other Silicon Valley giants like Apple or Alphabet, the company that owns Google.Tesla accounted for three-quarters of the electric cars sold in the United States last year. The company is several years ahead of competitors in battery technology and software. But two models -- the Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle -- accounted for 95 percent of Tesla's sales. Its next consumer vehicle, a pickup truck, has been delayed many times and is not expected until next year at the earliest.It's an axiom in the car industry that new models fuel sales. And competition from the likes of Hyundai, Ford and Volkswagen is growing, offering drivers many more choices.Jesse Toprak, an auto industry veteran who is chief analyst at Autonomy, a company that offers electric cars by subscription, said that Tesla's market share will fall below 40 percent by the end of 2023, though its sales will continue to grow as the overall market expands.""They will have a smaller share of a larger pot,"" Mr. Toprak said. ""But their near-monopoly on E.V. sales in the U.S. will slowly diminish.""Tesla already faces tough competition in Europe, where electric vehicles account for 13 percent of new car sales. That foreshadows what could happen in the United States, where sales of battery-powered cars are just beginning to take off. Volkswagen, which has invested heavily in electric vehicles, sold 56,000 battery-powered cars in Western Europe during the first three months of the year, just behind Tesla, which sold 58,000, according to figures compiled by Schmidt Automotive Research in Berlin.Tesla's ability to serve the European market will improve as a new factory near Berlin ramps up production. In the United States and elsewhere, the company has benefited from fanatically loyal buyers who regard Mr. Musk as a visionary and are willing to wait months or years for the company's cars.But as electric cars gain popularity because of skyrocketing gasoline prices, the next wave of customers may not be as tolerant or as enamored of Mr. Musk. ""The next generation of buyers will be average Joes who are buying E.V.s because it makes financial sense to them,"" Mr. Toprak said. ""The brand image of Tesla will be less helpful.""Tesla's image is under pressure in ways that could hurt the automaker among the environmentally conscious, politically liberal customers who have long been its biggest customer base. The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing is suing Tesla, accusing it of allowing racial discrimination and harassment to flourish at its factory in Fremont, Calif., near San Francisco. Tesla is contesting the lawsuit.In another blow, the S&P 500 ESG Index, a listing of companies that meet certain environmental, social and governance standards, ejected Tesla last month. S&P said it was disturbed by claims of racial discrimination and poor working conditions at the company's Fremont factory.Mr. Musk responded to S&P's decision by writing on Twitter that the movement to apply environmental, social and governance standards to corporations a ""scam"" that ""has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors.""Mr. Musk followed that Twitter post by declaring that he was switching his allegiance from the Democratic Party, which he said had ""become the party of division & hate,"" and would now vote for Republicans. Politically charged statements like those are certain to alienate some car buyers.""The more political he becomes, the more that might start to influence buyers,"" said Carla Bailo, chief executive of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich.Mr. Musk and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.Management turnover is another risk. Mr. Musk is a notoriously demanding boss who has warned Twitter employees that ""work ethic expectations would be extreme"" if he takes over the social media platform.The churn at Tesla is obvious. Many of its former senior managers are prominent in the start-up scene in the San Francisco Bay Area. Examples include Celina Mikolajczak, head of manufacturing at fledgling battery maker QuantumScape, who previously helped develop batteries at Tesla, and Gene Berdichevsky, another former Tesla battery developer who is chief executive of Sila Nanotechnologies. Sila announced this week that it would supply materials for advanced batteries to Mercedes-Benz.Lucid, maker of the only electric model to beat Tesla in the Environmental Protection Agency's tests of how far an electric car can go on a full charge, was founded by Peter Rawlinson, a former top Tesla engineer until he fell out with Mr. Musk. Lucid's headquarters is in Newark, Calif., a short drive from Tesla's Fremont factory.Mr. Musk's admirers say he has helped promote emission-free vehicles by seeding the industry with talent. But critics see a risk that Tesla will never develop a stable echelon of experienced managers who can run the company if anything ever happens to Mr. Musk.""You can't treat your workers poorly in a tight labor market like we have,"" said Mr. Poreda of Sage Advisory. ""One bright man can't make his vision into reality without a lot of really smart people.""Amid this litany of problems and risks, Mr. Musk has been spending time on acquiring Twitter, though he lately seems to be having second thoughts about the deal. The foray into social media has some investors wondering why the boss is spending so much time writing missives on Twitter while the world burns.""There is just a feeling,"" said Mr. Ives of Wedbush, ""that the pilot on the plane is watching some Netflix show while you're going through a massive thunderstorm.""PhotographCars leaving Tesla's factory in Shanghai.

220,22-May-22,Los Angeles Times,PERSPECTIVES; Why does Musk get away with flouting law?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2667342799/BFD812D457A14912PQ/304?accountid=13946,"In his takeover adventure with Twitter, it seems more likely than not that Elon Musk has broken the law.
In some respects, his lawbreaking is easily documented. According to Musk's own disclosure, his purchases of Twitter shares brought him to 5% ownership of the company stock on March 14.
Securities law requires that any such holding be divulged publicly and to the Securities and Exchange Commission within 10 days, or in this case by March 24; Musk didn't make the disclosure until April 4, which was 11 days late.

In financial terms, the consequences weren't trivial: By our calculations, the delay might have saved Musk more than $170 million in his Twitter purchases. To put it another way, he may have rooked the Twitter stockholders whose shares he bought out of $170 million.
This wouldn't be the first time Musk has run roughshod over laws or regulations. In the past, he has flouted not only securities rules but other public regulations as well, such as public health rules concerning the pandemic and rules regarding the safe operation of self-driving technologies on public roads.
Up to now, the general public reaction to this behavior has been limited to a bemused shaking of the head and the thought: ""How does he get away with it?"" But that's the wrong framing of the issue. The right framing is: ""Why do the authorities let him get away with it?""
Time and time again, Musk has gotten his way with regulators and municipal officials through bluster and intimidation.
Authorities seldom use their maximum enforcement powers against Musk. In a case involving a plainly misleading 2018 tweet about his intention to take his Tesla electric vehicle company private at a premium price, the SEC penalized Musk and Tesla $20 million each.
In the context of his personal wealth, which is estimated at about $219 billion based on the value of his Tesla stock, that's a wrist slap. The SEC, if it wishes, could move to hit him with a lifetime ban from association with a publicly traded company.
That would be exceptionally harsh -- the agency didn't impose the so-called bad boy penalty in cases involving banks complicit in the 2008 financial crash, and it is seldom even contemplated except when an executive is convicted of a felony. But it's on the books. In any event, the SEC's ability to impose much more stringent penalties on Musk than it has thus far is clear.
Among the adversaries that Musk has browbeaten, count the board of Twitter. The board responded to Musk's disclosure of a 9.2% stake in April by reaching an agreement for him to take a board seat. He then refused the seat and issued an offer to take over the company for $54.20 a share. The board quickly agreed.
But now Musk is acting as though he wants to bail out on the deal, leaving the Twitter board with few options: They could accept the $1-billion breakup fee written into the takeover contract, or try to force him to complete the deal on the agreed-upon terms.
Musk isn't the first entrepreneur, high-tech or otherwise, to act as though traditional rules and regulations don't apply to him.
Uber co-founder and former Chief Executive Travis Kalanick polished the technique to a high luster: When local officials tried to regulate or block his ride-hailing company's entry into their markets, he browbeat them with the accusation that they were standing in the way of a revolution that would bring cheap and reliable transportation to the people.
Often, the regulators backed down. In California, the Public Utilities Commission carved out a regulatory exception for Uber and Lyft, blocking local initiatives aimed at equalizing ride-hailing regulations with those of taxis, the drivers of which were generally subject to more stringent background checks and vehicle inspections than ride-hailing drivers.
As for the ostensibly indisputable benefits and virtues of the ride-hailing revolution, they're also highly illusory. Studies have found that when Uber and Lyft enter a market, their fleets are more polluting than autos on average; contribute to more traffic congestion, particularly in the central cities; undermine public transit systems; and devastate the local taxi industry.
Musk adheres to the tradition of taking legal and regulatory forbearance as an inducement and invitation to demand more. The Economist described his viewpoint succinctly: ""He paints stewards of fair play -- regulators and boards -- as pettifogging enemies of progress,"" wrote its pseudonymous business columnist ""Schumpeter.""
The evidence suggests that regulators have leaned over backward to satisfy Musk. The California Department of Motor Vehicles, for example, has consistently failed to hold Musk's electric vehicle company to the same standards for autonomous driving technology as it does other robot car developers.
Among other breaks given Tesla, as my colleague Russ Mitchell has documented, the company hasn't been required to report crashes and system failures associated with the Full Self-Driving iteration of its Autopilot feature to the DMV. Unlike competitors such as Waymo, Cruise, Argo and Zoox, Tesla allows its program to be tested on public roads by untrained drivers.
The harvest has been a flood of YouTube and Twitter posts showing Teslas driving into oncoming traffic, mistaking railroad tracks for paved streets, and aiming themselves into metal posts and traffic barriers.
In January, the California DMV said it would reassess its tolerant treatment of Tesla's self-driving testing. This is the opposite of the proactive approach that motorists should expect its regulators to take toward technical innovations that present manifest hazards to the public.
It is, however, similar to the approach of federal regulators such as the National Transportation Safety Board, which has been similarly lenient. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy, a Biden appointee, publicly questioned in October why Tesla had been allowed to ignore the board's 2017 safety recommendation for driver-assistance programs for years.
The board had made the recommendation to Tesla and five other companies with such programs, Homendy said in a letter addressed to Musk. ""Tesla is the only manufacturer that did not officially respond to us about the recommendation,"" she wrote.
Meanwhile, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has 14 deaths potentially associated with Tesla programs under investigation. These actions, also, are reactive rather than proactive. How many deaths must be investigated before the regulator stops allowing Tesla's program to be deployed in public?
During the pandemic, Musk took the attitude that the danger of COVID-19 had been exaggerated and that public health measures that affected his company were unwarranted. In March 2020, Tesla's Fremont, Calif., factory continued operating despite an order from Alameda County authorities that it be shut down in compliance with anti-pandemic policies.
""My frank opinion is that the harm from the coronavirus panic far exceeds that of the virus itself,"" Musk wrote in a message to employees. He predicted that COVID-19 cases ""will not exceed 0.1% of the population."" In the U.S., cases have reached about 25% of the population, and deaths alone have reached 0.3%.
Alameda authorities soon backed down, allowing the Fremont plant to continue operating. The plant emerged as a local hot spot for COVID infections, with more than 400 cases recorded between May and December 2020 among its 10,000 workers.
Then there's the relationship between the SEC and Musk. The agency took action against Musk in 2018 over his tweet declaring that he was intending to take Tesla private for $420 per share, a substantial premium over its price at the time. The tweet said funding for the transaction was ""secured.""
In fact, there was no funding, and Musk had taken no significant steps toward any such deal. His tweet set off a brief trading frenzy in Tesla stock.
The agency and Musk eventually settled the agency's lawsuit over the tweet with a deal requiring Musk and Tesla each to pay a penalty of $20 million, and for Musk to step down from his position as Tesla chairman. He was permitted to remain as CEO.
His future tweets about Tesla were to be reviewed by company lawyers before they could be posted, the settlement mandated.
Yet Musk continued to issue tweets that appeared to violate the deal, prompting the agency to return to court to make its terms crystal clear. The SEC may have thought that would settle the matter, but it didn't. Last November, Musk tweeted about possibly selling a sizable portion of his Tesla shares, without clearing the tweets in advance.
The SEC subpoenaed records related to the tweets, prompting Musk to ask a judge to invalidate the original deal on the claim that he had been coerced into signing it. The judge refused.
Musk's purported deal to buy Twitter and take the company private is chock-full of the same in-and-out running. When he finally disclosed his share buying on April 4, he did so on a form reserved for passive investors, those with no intention of controlling the target company.
At the time, however, according to a disclosure filed by Twitter on Tuesday, he already had told Twitter's chairman and CEO ""that he was considering various options with respect to his ownership, including potentially joining the Twitter board, seeking to take Twitter private or starting a competitor to Twitter.""
More recently, Musk has been signaling that he may not want to acquire Twitter after all, raising a manifestly thin excuse for putting the transaction ""on hold."" Whichever way you cut, at least some of Musk's comments have been fundamentally misleading.
These are by no means victimless offenses. Tesla shares soared by about 6% shortly after his taking-private tweet, which meant that at least some buyers were fooled into overpaying. Then there's Musk's delayed disclosure of his Twitter share purchases. In the trades between the date Musk was required to disclose his purchases and the day he finally did so, he acquired 13.1 million shares for about $513.2 million, or an average of about $39.05 each. Twitter closed at $38.29 Friday.
On April 5, the day after he disclosed, Twitter shares rose to about $51, based at least partly on investor enthusiasm about his interest in the company. Had he made a timely disclosure and shares hit that level on March 25, he would have spent about $670.2 million for the same shares, or about $157 million more.
Obviously, it's impossible to do more than conjecture about what Twitter's price would be between March 25 and April 4 if Musk disclosed as required, but it's reasonable to say that he saved a bundle by delaying his disclosure, and Twitter shareholders, for whom his buying plainly was of material interest, made that much less.
Musk's maneuvering over Twitter could be the high-water mark of his manipulative method. If the deal falls through, it could be harder for any potential partner to take him at his word. But more important is the corrosive effect Musk's actions have had on the rule of law and principles of fair dealing.
If he's allowed to skate on his evident violations of securities law and reckless treatment of the market, then more billionaires who care only about their own level of self-esteem will feel even freer to take advantage of the rest of us.

221,22-May-22,Pantagraph,"People, not corporations, pay taxes Varner: Corporations don't pay taxes - people do",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2698661713/BFD812D457A14912PQ/657?accountid=13946,"Students can be a little weak on past events, but they do know about O.J. and, if they know anything about the first President Bush, it is: ""Read my lips. No new taxes."" Has the current occupant of that office painted himself into a corner by saying that no one making less than $400,000 will pay more in taxes?
The 1040 line 12 is a favorite for me because it allows a $600 charitable contribution for those taking the standard deduction. I would like to see that raised substantially. To pay for it, why not reduce the maximum home mortgage deduction from a maximum $750,000 to $500,000? We want to encourage and help families to own the roofs over their heads, but $750,000?
But Biden wouldn't be able to agree, because some of those homeowners would probably earn under $400,000.
While no politician would vote for it these days, our roads need a fix. And why not raise the gas tax? Gasoline is about $9 a gallon in Germany today, but there is no word I know in their language for ""pothole.""
Yet we have been offered a vast array of government-sponsored goodies, and never has so much been offered to so many to be paid for by so few.
The top 1% and corporations would foot the bill for a vast infrastructure overhaul, free daycare under federal regulation, and much more. We need good daycare, but to federalize the system might well take one bureaucrat for every teacher in the classroom.
Tax rate revision
We will let the top 1% take care of themselves today, but let's focus on the corporation issue. For years, America's 35% corporate tax was the highest in the world. The 2017 reforms made our rate not low, exactly, but at least at an internationally competitive 21%. You may think if it goes back to 35% or whatever it has nothing to do with your personal well-being. One step at a time, but the bottom line is that corporations are YOU.
Money that a company brings in goes into a number of pots, taxes being one. Think of the competition our new neighbor Rivian faces in finding high-quality employees. A profitable company will use some of their money to increase wages - not as charity, but for sound business reasons.
Obviously, higher wages can reduce profits, but when those wages attract the best workers, the business can make up for that with increased productivity. When the employees have been taken care of, next come taxes and shareholders. Every dollar more in taxes is a dollar less for shareholders. So, you ask, what does that have to do with me? Who are these shareholders, anyway? Look in your mirror.
Institutions own corporations
It is often imagined that corporate America is owned by a few millionaires and billionaires. Bill Gates owns less than 2% of Microsoft, Jeff Bezos about 10% of Amazon and Elon Musk a whopping 17% of Tesla, although if his planned purchase of Twitter goes through, that number will surely go down.
I was surprised to learn that a full 80% of the stock market is owned by what are called institutions. This includes various kinds of mutual funds, IRA retirement accounts, and company and government pension plans. The California system (CALPERS), which is the largest, has assets of over $500 billion. Nearer to my heart, Illinois' own State University Retirement System has a mere $23 billion.
At Illinois State University we are not under Social Security. We put 8% of our earnings into SURS and it is matched, we hope, by the state. That money is out there in the markets working very hard to give you a comfortable retirement. If corporate taxes go up, that is money right out of your pocket.
My math says that if you have a good job at ISU, when you retire you will be a millionaire, or very close. You probably don't feel that rich, but a retirement income paid out over hopefully many decades requires a healthy nest egg that will continue to work hard for you.
So, if corporate taxes go up, President Biden, like Bush I before him, will have broken his promise. That said, there is no free lunch, and even a more limited government needs a lot of money, and needs for both the rich and Average Joe to pay their share. What is fair seems to be totally in the eye of the beholder.
Tax systems
We have one of the most progressive tax systems in the world. There are other kinds of taxes, but that much-maligned top 1% pay about 40% of all federal income taxes. We have more inequality than Western Europe, but we also have more energy and freedom to develop businesses. Elon Musk is an immigrant with incredible energy and creativity. Why do you think he came here rather than any other country?
We want a system that is as efficient as possible, and for this I have three guiding principles. Fifty years ago, the corporate tax was at 48% and the personal rate was as high as 70%. Today, they are at 21% and 37%, respectively. Those high earlier rates drained our business energy and creativity. If you yearn to return to the 1970s, those tax rates would put us back there.
Next, keep loopholes (or the more polite word, preferences) to a minimum. Every loophole is a revenue hemorrhage. Check out Illinois schedule M and 1299c. There are pages of loopholes showing what Illinois politics (Democratic and Republican) are all about. My personal favorite is M line 24. I have an investment (Abbott Labs) in Chicago subzone 22z and pay no Illinois tax on the dividends. I do save a bit, but think what this red tape costs the treasury.
Next is one you probably have, too. At the bottom of page one of IL 1040 is line 18s, a 5% credit for property tax paid on your home. The average savings for us would be a couple hundred dollars. You probably feel it is a break you well deserve. It was reported that the house in Winnetka used in the movie ""Home Alone"" has a property tax of $31,000, making the credit a much more substantial $1,550. See what I mean?
Finally, I like to see tax money spent as close to home as possible. You may recall a proposal that would cap property taxes and raise state income taxes. We would send more money to Springfield, and they would send it back - or would it fly overhead in a northeasterly direction?
In 1980, as I said, the individual tax rate was as high as 70% and my wife and I, as young faculty members at ISU, had a 49% marginal rate. The Reagan reforms cut the maximum rate to 50%. Then, with regulatory reform closing loopholes and Democrats on board, the maximum rate was cut to 28%, helping to help to give us 40 of the most creative and productive years in human history.
I recall a Republican saying that his Democratic opponent never met a tax he didn't like. The response was that the Republican never met a loophole for his friends he didn't like. Possibly there is some truth in each. I have to believe that rational discussion and action will be our way, despite all the noise.

The 50 wealthiest people, which include Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, have had a combined $563 billion in net worth evaporate this year through May 22, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , a ranking updated daily of the richest people in the world. The drop comes as the stock market flirts with its first bear market since the beginning of the pandemic.
Mr. Musk, Tesla Inc.'s chief executive and the world's richest man , currently has a net worth of $201 billion. On paper, he has lost $69.1 billion so far this year, the most of any billionaire currently on the top 50 list, according to the index. He is in the midst of buying social-media company Twitter Inc. for $44 billion, a deal that he has said is on hold .
Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos's net worth has fallen by $61.1 billion and Bernard Arnault, France's wealthiest man and chief executive of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, has had $55.2 billion in wealth erased. Mr. Bezos still has a net worth of $131 billion and Mr. Arnault is worth $123 billion.
Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates is currently worth $116 billion but has lost $21.7 billion in wealth this year. Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s Warren Buffett rounds out the top five with a net worth of $110 billion. Unlike the four people richer than him, his net worth has risen this year by $1.2 billion. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index measures personal wealth based on changes in markets, the economy and other reporting.
The losses for the billionaires come as a monthslong selloff in the stock market has picked up speed and has begun spreading beyond technology shares. Consumer-staples companies, which had dodged most of the damage, have started taking losses. For the year, the S&P 500 has fallen about 17%, while the Nasdaq Composite has dropped 26%.
Other notable people who have had sharp declines include Meta Platforms Inc. founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who has seen a $54.1 billion loss this year. Google co-founder Larry Page has lost $29 billion. Changpeng Zhao, founder of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, now ranks 113th on the list after losing $80.9 billion so far this year, the most of any individual that the Bloomberg Billionaires Index tracks. His drop comes as cryptocurrencies have also been hard hit over the past few months.
The stock market slide also reversed the gains the world's wealthiest people saw during the start of the pandemic when a billionaire was created every 30 hours, according to a new report released Monday by antipoverty group Oxfam International. The number of billionaires in the world increased by 573 from March 2020 to March 2022, raising the globe's grand total to 2,668, according to the report.
The collective wealth of billionaires rose more during the first two years of the pandemic than they did between the collective years between 1987 and 2010, according to the report. And the total wealth of the world's billionaires is now equivalent to 13.9% of global GDP, a threefold increase from 2000.

223,24-May-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Says ESG Is a 'Scam.' Why He May Have a Point.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2668093653/BFD812D457A14912PQ/351?accountid=13946,"About the authors: Alex Friedman, Josh Green, and Lorraine Spradley Wilson are, respectively, the CEO, chief operating officer, and chief impact officer of Novata.
The knives are out for ESG.
First, some politicians sought to make environmental, social, and governance factors in investing a right vs. left issue. Then the world's largest investment firm said shareholders have gotten out of control by taking over this year's proxy season with too many prescriptive ESG proposals. And now Elon Musk has loudly joined the fray, incensed that Tesla has been kicked out of the S&P ESG Index.
The detached observer might ask, if Tesla isn't fit for an ESG grouping of companies, then who is? The nondetached Musk just tweeted , ""ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors."" Musk has a lot going on right now, so we can excuse his critique's lack of nuance.
But we run an ESG company, and we're here to tell you that Musk has a point.
Imagine, for a moment, you are asked which professional athlete is the best. Or asked to rank all athletes. The obvious questions that follow might include: which sport? By which measure? Team wins? Individual statistics? Over what time period? And are we just talking about end results, or do we include the athlete's attitude and conduct as he or she competes?
In Tesla's case, few dispute that its cars play an important, perhaps critical, role in pushing the auto industry toward becoming greener. But S&P's exclusion is not driven by Tesla's cars, but because of concerns around issues like Tesla's working conditions, how it handles investigations into crashes, water use, its supply chain, and the company's lack of a formal low carbon strategy and codes of business conduct.
The problem with ESG disclosure as a tool—whether for investors or even society—is that it is way too blunt a frame. As it is currently conceived, ESG is at risk of becoming little more than a marketing slogan, destined to confuse, or be labeled ""greenwashing."" The risk is that the whole ESG concept gets thrown down the drain before it gets the chance to grow up.
So, what should be done? Here are a few steps that might help to ensure ESG gets the time it needs to develop.
First, those three letters need to be unbundled.
Which company in an industry group, or in a market capitalization grouping, is more responsible for CO2 emissions? This is a question we can ask and answer. Which company is doing a better job of paying employees a living wage? This is a question we can ask and answer. Which company has a better worker safety record? This is a question we can ask and answer.
We run into trouble if we try to roll these and other questions together to answer, ""Which company is better?"" It might make for fun trivia, but the question isn't answerable in any way that would help markets allocate capital. Is Serena Williams a better athlete than Michael Jordan? Is Tiger Woods a better athlete than Lindsey Vonn?
Second, the metrics that are used in each of the E, S, and G categories need common definitions. It is not that all companies need to track the same metrics, because some metrics that matter for one industry are irrelevant for another. But we need the definitions of each metric to be close enough to enable useful comparisons when employed. The work of the International Sustainability Standards Board to update and globalize the SASB's industry-based standards is incredibly important in terms of enabling comparability.
Third, we need to stop focusing on overall rankings and binary choices, such as inclusion or exclusion from a particular index. Each provider of those services will have its own methodology and nuances, developed to meet the needs of its target audience. Right now, the information that underpins those products—company nonfinancial data—is all over the place. One level up, there are weightings applied to those metrics to roll complex data into a single rating or score. Pick a company in the Fortune 500 and sample the top five ESG ratings providers—a correlation of less than 50% is normal. By comparison, the top five ratings providers for a typical corporate bond from the same Fortune 500 company would likely have a correlation greater than 80%. This kind of result undermines confidence in ESG writ large.
Benchmarks driven by actual data generated by companies themselves and held to the same standard as financial data, on the other hand, are useful. They are useful for the company itself when its managers and board seek to understand areas they need to focus on and improve. And they are useful for investors trying to understand where to allocate capital based on more than just traditional financial metrics.
But for benchmarking to work broadly, for both public and private companies, we need some basic agreement on a core set of E, S, and G metrics that should be tracked, and we need a way for companies to share the data on an anonymized basis.
In some countries, regulators are pushing more of a common framework of which ESG factors should be tracked. Europe is rolling out Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation to improve transparency related to investment products. And last March, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a new draft proposal to add standardized climate reporting to required disclosures by public companies, while the U.K. passed a Climate-related Financial Disclosure law in January. Over time, there will be more convergence, analogous perhaps to how generally accepted accounting principles, the international financial reporting standards, and other accounting regimes drive to similar end points.
Importantly, as more companies choose to report ESG metrics, their boards of directors should ultimately be accountable for an appropriately rigorous method of collecting, storing, and analyzing such data. Industry groups, in turn, should collect the anonymized data and provide benchmark visibility to all participants. We're entering an era where forward-thinking CFOs are beginning to review ESG data with the same rigor as company financials.
It took Elon Musk a lot of time and a lot of failures to get his cars and rockets on course. There were numerous false starts and modifications along the way.
Let's give the ideals behind ESG a chance to get it right too.

224,24-May-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"SpaceX Shoots to $125 Billion Valuation, Shrugging Off Elon Musk's Woes; The entrepreneur's rocket company raises at least $1.5 billion to fund expansion",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2668413498/BFD812D457A14912PQ/514?accountid=13946,"SpaceX raised a fresh round of funding as the company led by Elon Musk pushes forward with multibillion-dollar projects and faces rising costs.
The company has raised at least $1.5 billion in its latest funding round, according to an investor. The financing values SpaceX at around $125 billion, the investor said. Last year, the company was valued at $100 billion, according to researcher PitchBook.
In addition, SpaceX is offering to buy shares from existing stockholders, giving current and former staff a chance to cash out.
A SpaceX spokesman didn't respond to requests for comment.
The fresh cash comes as Mr. Musk faces a new bout of controversy. Last week, Insider reported that SpaceX in 2018 paid an unidentified flight attendant $250,000 to settle a sexual-misconduct claim against Mr. Musk, the company's chief executive. Mr. Musk responded on Twitter, calling the accusations ""utterly untrue.""
SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell told company staff in a subsequent email that she personally believed that allegations made against Mr. Musk were false. Neither she nor Mr. Musk, who also leads Tesla Inc. and has agreed to buy Twitter Inc., addressed whether a settlement was paid. Ms. Shotwell said in the email that SpaceX doesn't tolerate harassment of any kind.

CNBC earlier reported on the latest funding efforts and the email from Ms. Shotwell.
The company's capital-intensive efforts include Starship, the rocket system that Mr. Musk has said he wants to use for deep-space missions he envisions and for the company's Starlink satellite-internet service.
Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, has been building out infrastructure for Starship at a site near the southern tip of Texas, and testing and manufacturing engines and other hardware for the vehicles. SpaceX wants to begin conducting orbital demonstration flights of Starship from the property, a proposal the Federal Aviation Administration is currently reviewing. In February, Mr. Musk said that SpaceX could also end up testing Starship from Florida .
Mr. Musk has described the development of the rocket system, which is meant to be fully reusable, as difficult and pointed to what he said were cost savings the company achieved on the engines that would undergird it.
SpaceX is also spending on Starlink, its unit that uses a fleet of satellites to power a broadband internet service.
The company said earlier this year that it now is capable of building up to 45 satellites per week, and has sought permission to send up tens of thousands of additional satellites . As of May, it had launched more than 2,400 of them, according to a recent filing with the Federal Communications Commission. The company also makes the terminals that allow users to obtain Starlink internet connections.
Mr. Musk said last year that SpaceX was likely to invest at least $5 billion and perhaps as much as $10 billion in Starlink, with ongoing investments after that.
As with other companies, SpaceX's costs have climbed. The company recently boosted the price of user kits for Starlink and raised the monthly charge for the service to $110 from $99. SpaceX also increased prices for launches on its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.
Mr. Musk has said on Twitter that SpaceX and electric-vehicle maker Tesla are dealing with significant cost pressures related to raw materials and logistics.
SpaceX has also looked to keep adding staff, even as other companies take a more cautious approach on hiring , given current market conditions and investor views.
The company as of Monday evening listed more than 850 job openings on its website, ranging from software engineers to welders.
SpaceX has conducted several significant equity sales in recent years. The company sold almost $1.9 billion in equity in 2021, for example, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 SpaceX Shoots to $125 Billion Valuation, Shrugging Off Elon Musk's Woes

225,24-May-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk and the Baby Bust; More useful commentary from Twitter's possible next owner.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2668464747/BFD812D457A14912PQ/632?accountid=13946,"Due to recent declines in stock prices, Elon Musk is now down to his last $200 billion . But despite all the sellers in today's market, Mr. Musk is not letting those vast herds get him down. Instead, the Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder is once again offering compelling commentary on Twitter.
Today Mr. Musk is sharing a graphic from the Wall Street Journal and tweeting :
USA birth rate has been below min sustainable levels for ~50 years...
Contrary to what many think, the richer someone is, the fewer kids they have.
I am a rare exception. Most people I know have zero or one kid.
Perhaps Mr. Musk will consider broadening his social circle. According to a March story in People magazine, he has fathered eight children.
As a society's wealth and income rise, people tend to have fewer children. As Mr. Musk notes, for virtually the entire period of the last 50 years, America's total fertility rate has been running below the 2.1 kids per woman that is considered necessary for a generation to replace itself. The trend has been even more bleak in a number of other industrialized countries. Earlier this month Mr. Musk tweeted in reaction to news of the largest decline in Japan's population since at least 1950:
At risk of stating the obvious, unless something changes to cause the birth rate to exceed the death rate, Japan will eventually cease to exist. This would be a great loss for the world.
It surely would and while things are not so dire in the U.S., today's news shows only modest improvement in a dismal long-term trend. The Journal's Janet Adamy and Anthony DeBarros report :
U.S. births increased last year for the first time in seven years, according to federal figures released Tuesday . . .
American women had about 3.66 million babies in 2021, up 1% from the prior year, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. It was the first increase since 2014 . . .
Births still remain at historically low levels after peaking in 2007 and then plummeting during the recession that began the end of that year. The total fertility rate—a snapshot of the average number of babies a woman would have over her lifetime—was 1.66 last year, up from 1.64 the prior year, when it fell to the lowest level since the government began tracking it in the 1930s.
""This minor blip up still leaves us on a long-term trajectory towards lower births,"" said Phillip Levine, an economics professor at Wellesley College.
Perhaps we shouldn't expect too much in the short term, either, as current conditions could further discourage potential parents from having children. The Journal reporters note that a ""sharp rise in inflation and a shortage of baby formula could put pressure on births"".
Beyond the obvious point that it sure would be nice if the United States of America continued to exist, there's also the need for creative human beings to solve tomorrow's problems. To be crass, there's also the not inconsequential need to service $30 trillion in federal debt. On Wednesday the Congressional Budget Office will issue its latest official guesses about the future of the U.S. economy and federal budgets. But we can already say with certainty that the massive challenges to be reported do not become easier to manage with an ever-shrinking population of workers.
Hmm. If only there were some way to enable and encourage more births in the U.S., and also perhaps some sort of mechanism to see if people who don't currently live in the U.S. might wish to come here and become productive citizens.
This column appreciates the view of many Americans that the President seems to want to maintain the integrity of every national border except our own. But let's not allow the lawlessness and misery that the White House is willing to tolerate to obscure the fact that America could benefit greatly from significant increases in all categories of legal migration. How many more immigrants like Elon Musk are ready, willing and able to create new enterprises in the U.S. if only we will give them a chance?
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology recently noted research conducted by one of its economists, along with colleagues at Northwestern, Penn, and the U.S. Census Bureau:
Immigrants to the U.S. are more likely to start businesses than native-born Americans are, according to a study that takes a wide-ranging look at registered businesses across the country . . . the study finds that, per capita, immigrants are about 80 percent more likely to found a firm, compared to U.S.-born citizens. Those firms also have about 1 percent more employees than those founded by U.S. natives, on average.
""Immigrants, relative to natives and relative to their share of the population, found more firms of every size,"" says Pierre Azoulay, an economist at the MIT Sloan School of Management and co-author of a published paper detailing the study's results.
Taking firm creation into account, the results indicate that immigration to the U.S. is associated with a net gain in job availability, contrary to the common perception that immigrants fill jobs that U.S.-born workers would otherwise have.
""The findings suggest that immigrants act more as 'job creators' than 'job takers' and that non-U.S. born founders play outsized roles in U.S. high-growth entrepreneurship,"" the authors write in the paper.
It's important to note that the authors are not just talking about tech start-ups, but all types of businesses. Wouldn't we prefer that tomorrow's founders create jobs here rather than somewhere else? Not that the tech industry doesn't have an especially acute need for people. The Journal's Julie Bykowicz recently reported from Washington:
Tech-industry representatives are coming to Capitol Hill . . . to warn that the remote-work trend will lead to more offshoring of software developer and other technology jobs unless the U.S. admits more high-skilled immigrants.
Remote jobs in tech jumped by more than 420% between January 2020 and last month, growth that was intensified by the pandemic, according to a jobs data review by Tecna, a trade group for regional tech councils. In February, more than 22% of all tech jobs were listed as remote, compared with 4.4% in January 2020.
""The level of remote tech positions that are open is drastically higher than it was prepandemic,"" said Jennifer Grundy Young, Tecna's chief executive officer. ""That means workers can live anywhere in the U.S., but it also unfortunately opens the door to more outsourcing—workers staying in India, in China, or moving to places like Canada that have more flexible immigration policies.""
The U.S. allows 65,000 skilled-worker visas annually under its H1-B program, plus another 20,000 for people who hold graduate degrees from American universities. Those numbers haven't budged since 2005 despite the sharp rise in tech jobs.
In contrast, Canada, which has been courting tech workers for years, has no cap on visas for immigrating tech workers and entrepreneurs, making it an attractive destination for Indian, Chinese and Eastern European computer coders and software engineers who have had a hard time obtaining U.S. visas.
Born in South Africa, Elon Musk's first North American address was in Canada. Fortunately he was allowed to move south.

 Elon Musk and the Baby Bust

226,25-May-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Is Losing Money on His Twitter Stock. He Can Still Buy the Company—If He Wants.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2668863875/BFD812D457A14912PQ/256?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk is sitting on a loss in his Twitter position. The loss is peanuts compared with what's happened to his Tesla stock. Despite all the red ink, the world's richest human can still buy Twitter — if he still wants to.
Twitter (ticker: TWTR) closed a $35.76, down 5.5%, amid a broad market selloff catalyzed by weak revenue guidance from Snap (SNAP). The Nasdaq Composite fell 2.3%. Snap stock fell 43.1%. Tesla (TSLA) stock fell 6.9%, closing at $628.16.
The Twitter and Tesla stock declines on Tuesday didn't seem to have had anything to do with Twitter's potential purchase by Musk , but they hurt the Tesla CEO nonetheless. Musk's original 73 million-plus share stake disclosed on April 4 cost him an average of about $36.16.
Twitter shares hadn't closed below that since the stake was disclosed. Musk is down about 40 cents a share, or roughly $30 million, based on the early filings disclosing his stake.
That amount of money isn't a big deal for Musk. The decline in Tesla stock matters much more. Since Musk's initial stake in Twitter was disclosed, Tesla stock has dropped down about 45%. The drop in Tesla has cost the CEO about $87 billion in wealth. (The math is a little nuanced. Musk sold about 9.6 million shares in late April at higher prices to fund his Twitter purchase)..
Musk's remaining 163 million shares are worth about $102 billion. He plans to use stock to borrow about $6 billion to $7 billion against the value of his stock to finance part of his Twitter purchase. He is allowed to borrow up to 25% of the value of his Tesla stock, which gives him about $25 billion of borrowing capacity. Musk, however, probably doesn't have the full $25 billion in margin lending available to him; he has borrowed against the value of his shares in the past.
Investors need to know how much money he has borrowed, or repaid, to get an accurate sense of Musk's borrowing capacity. Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the status of Musk's prior margin loans.
Musk needs, very roughly, another $9 billion to purchase the 690 million-plus shares of Twitter he doesn't own. Musk already has non-margin debt, cash from Tesla sales and billions from other equity partners.
He has other sources of cash, mainly SpaceX shares, vested Tesla stock options. He could also sell more Tesla stock and avoid the margin loan, but Tesla shareholders won't like seeing more large blocks of Tesla stock sold.
What's more, the $9 billion figure presumes Musk pays the original price of $54.20 a share. That is far from certain. Musk is going back and forth with Twitter management over the number of spam tweets, which Musk says is a material factor when evaluating what Twitter is worth. Twitter said it is about 5% of daily active usage. Musk believes it is much higher.
The market seems to believe no deal or a deal at a lower price is the most likely outcome of the back and forth. Twitter stock is $18.44 below Musk's bid. That implies gains of 52% for someone buying Twitter now. Said the other way, it is 34% below the bid price.
The market isn't waiting for that gain to be realized. It is waiting for another shoe to drop.

228,27-May-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Explains the Benefits of Recession. Don't Forget the Costs.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2670073907/BFD812D457A14912PQ/327?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has a lot to do. He runs four companies and might add a fifth, but he also plays the role of economist from time to time.
The Tesla (ticker: TSLA) CEO tweeted out Thursday night that a lengthy global recession was possible, but explained that wasn't all bad.
Musk thinks a global recession, likely resulting from the mix of rising inflation and interest rates, could last more than a year. A downturn that long, however, would kill off companies that don't generate positive cash flow and consume resources, according to the CEO.
In addition to managing Tesla, he runs SpaceX , Neuralink, and The Boring Company . He might add Twitter (TWTR), where he has more than 95 million followers, to his list of businesses.
Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment about Musk's feelings about recessions or what Tesla would do if his scenario played out.
It isn't the first time in recent history that Musk has offered some economic thoughts. He talked about the benefits of robotic labor on the overall economy when introducing Tesla's humanoid robot project Optimus.
Better reallocation of capital is one potential benefit of recession. Musk isn't the first person to suggest that. Andrew Mellon served as secretary of the Treasury under three U.S. presidents—Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover—and he said something similar around the start of the 1930s.
""Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate. Purge the rottenness out of the system. High costs of living and high living will come down [and] enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people,"" is the advice Hoover attributed to Mellon in his memoirs .
Capital certainly gets wasted in boom times. Everyone has a story or memory of a business that just doesn't seem to make a lot of sense. In the bull market of recent years, many start-ups that merged with special-purpose acquisition companies have struggled to hit their original revenue projections. That could be a sign their business models weren't as sound as hoped.
Still, recessions do more than reset the capital-allocation function in an economy. They are painful, with falling stock prices and rising unemployment. Mellon's comments, in fact, were made around the start of the Great Depression. They haven't aged well.
The Depression, of course, followed the Roaring 20s. By late in that decade, capital was being given to the early 20th century equivalent of shaky start-ups.
The economic downturn that followed the 1920s was brutal. Unemployment rose from about 3% in 1929 to almost 24% in 1932.
That level of pain from any economic downturn is rare. Regulators get part of the blame for making the downturn following the 1920s worse than it had to be. ""Regarding the Great Depression …we did it. We're very sorry [and] we won't do it again,"" said former Federal Reserve chair Ben Bernanke in 2002 at a party for Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman's 90th birthday.
Bernanke's point was the Fed could have reacted with more accommodative policy—cutting interest rates and helping debtors pay their bills—to help ease the downturn.
Maybe the Great Depression didn't have to be so great, but it's a risky idea to suggest a downturn's benefits will outweigh the costs. Business upturns and downturns both come with their list of nasty unforeseen outcomes.
Tesla shares, along with stocks of other auto makers, are acting like a recession is on the way. Tesla, General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) shares are down about 35% year to date, on average, worse than the 15% and 10%, comparable, respective declines of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average.
Cars are big purchases, usually financed, and investors typically sell car stocks entering an economic downturn. Investors are worried about the future. That is the biggest reason for the 2022 decline in those stocks. All three companies are making good money right now.

229,28-May-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",EXCHANGE --- Business News: SEC Confirms Inquiry of Musk,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2670490791/BFD812D457A14912PQ/597?accountid=13946,"The Securities and Exchange Commission confirmed it is looking into the timing of when Elon Musk notified the market that he had bought 5% of Twitter Inc.'s stock.
The SEC, in a Friday filing, published a letter sent to Mr. Musk, dated April 4, asking why he didn't make the required filing within 10 days of crossing the 5% threshold. Mr. Musk's holdings topped 5% on March 14, securities filings show, and he announced the size of his stake in a filing April 4, by which time it topped 9%.
The Wall Street Journal reported on the SEC investigation earlier this month. Mr. Musk hasn't publicly explained why he didn't file in a timely manner.
Confirmation of the SEC probe comes as Twitter's board reached a deal to keep Egon Durban as a director after he failed to win a majority of shareholder support this week for a new term after some shareholder-advisory groups raised concerns that he sat on too many boards.
Mr. Durban, the co-chief executive of private-equity firm Silver Lake, tendered his resignation from the board of the social-media company after preliminary results of votes cast at Twitter's annual meeting Wednesday had him falling short of the threshold needed to keep his seat.
Twitter was under no obligation to accept his resignation under the social-media company's bylaws.
The agreement reached on Thursday lets Mr. Durban stay on the board in exchange for reducing the number of company' boards that he serves on, Twitter said Friday in a securities filing.
Mr. Durban has been part of Twitter's transaction committee and closely involved in talks between the company and Mr. Musk, according to a person familiar with the matter and a regulatory filing.
Last month, Mr. Musk agreed to buy Twitter for $44 billion. Mr. Musk, who also runs Tesla Inc., has since said the deal was ""temporarily on hold."" Twitter said it was proceeding with the transaction as agreed.
Twitter said its board determined that Mr. Durban's resignation isn't in the best interests of the company.
Mr. Durban agreed to serve on no more than five public company boards by May 25, 2023.
Mr. Durban currently serves on the boards of six other publicly traded companies, in addition to Twitter.

230,30-May-22,USA Today (Online),"No driver: Fully autonomous cars now navigate some roads in Austin, Texas",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2671293029/BFD812D457A14912PQ/539?accountid=13946,"AUSTIN, Texas – Truly driverless cars – this time with no human drivers ready to take over in case of emergency – are now cruising around Austin. Pittsburgh-based technology company Argo AI says it has begun operating its autonomous test vehicles without human safety drivers in Austin. The company is also testing the driverless vehicles in Miami. Argo AI has been operating in Austin since 2019 in partnership with Ford Motor Co. Ford has been deploying prototypes in Austin to establish the city as a proving ground for autonomous vehicle technology. To further test its autonomous technology in Austin, Argo AI and Ford have since established a partnerships with ridehailing service Lyft and and with retail giant Walmart, with the vehicles being part of Walmart's delivery service.

No human behind the wheel However, all those vehicles had humans ready to take over in case something went wrong. Now, Argo AI is testing a fleet of vehicles with no human behind the wheel. The company called it an important milestone in its plan to bring together the technology, operational resources and partners needed to grow its autonomous vehicle business.  Bryan Salesky, founder and CEO of Argo AI, said the company ""is first to go driverless in two major American cities, safely operating amongst heavy traffic, pedestrians and bicyclists in the busiest of neighborhoods. From day one, we set out to tackle the hardest miles to drive – in multiple cities – because that’s where the density of customer demand is, and where our autonomy platform is developing the intelligence required to scale it into a sustainable business.”  For now, only Argo AI employees will be passengers in the driverless vehicles, and the passengers will be able to stop or trigger the vehicle to pull over in case of emergency, the company said. Argo said the vehicles are primarily operating downtown, as well as in east and south Austin.

'Ain't nobody in it.' Autonomous rules of the road The company also will also continue to operate autonomous vehicles with a safety driver behind the wheel as part of its pilot program with Walmart. It also plans to soon do the same with Lyft.  Last year, Ford said it plans to scale up to at least 1,000 autonomous vehicles on the Lyft network over the next five years across multiple markets, starting with a small rollout in Miami in 2021 followed by Austin this year.  Last year, Argo AI also announced that self-driving cars would soon be delivering Austin-area Walmart orders in a defined area.  In Texas, autonomous vehicles are regulated under a 2017 law that allows them to operate on Texas roads without a driver inside. Prior to that, there was no law prohibiting autonomous vehicles. Companies including Uber have tested on Texas roads since 2015. Texas law requires driverless vehicles used on highways to be capable of following all traffic laws, have insurance just like other cars and be equipped with video recording devices. The manufacturers are also considered responsible for any broken traffic laws or collisions.

231,31-May-22,The New York Observer,India Wants Tesla But Elon Musk Still has No Plans to Open a Factory There,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2671801623/BFD812D457A14912PQ/194?accountid=13946,"Tesla has expressed an interest in opening a factory in India. Michael Macor/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images
Years of trade wars, rising labor costs, and the fluid Covid situation in China have led many Western companies to consider moving their supply chains to other developing countries. India has emerged as an attractive choice for manufacturing-heavy companies like Apple because of its low labor cost and the size of its consumer market. But Tesla, whose China factory has been partially shut down for two months has no plans to open shop in India because country’s complex trade rules that make it difficult to sell Tesla cars there.
Tesla won’t set up a manufacturing facility in a country where it’s not allowed to sell and service its cars, CEO Elon Musk tweeted May 27, in response to a Twitter user who asked whether Tesla has plans to build a factory in India.
Tesla cars are subject to 100% tariff in India
Talks of Tesla entering India have been floating for years. The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has shown a willingness for Tesla to make its electric vehicles locally to boost India’s EV adoption and Musk has expressed an interest in doing business in India as well. However, for that to happen, Musk wantsIndia to first lower its hefty import duties, which can be as high as 100 percent for foreign-made cars priced similarly to Tesla’s.
For that reason, Tesla doesn’t ship EVs to India, although its website accepts reservations from Indian buyers, according to Tesla Club India, an unofficial group of Tesla fans in India.
In July 2021, Musk said a factory in India is “quite likely” as long as the Indian government lowers auto import duties or imposes a “temporary tariff relief” on electric vehicles.
But we are hopeful that there will be at least a temporary tariff relief for electric vehicles. That would be much appreciated.
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 23, 2021
Why is India’s auto tariff so high? 
India’s import duties on automobiles are significantly higher than that of other major developing economies. China charges an import tax between 10 percent and 20 percent on foreign-made passenger cars. Indonesia charges up to 50 percent.
India most recently hiked up import duties on a slew of products in 2017 under the Modi government’s Made in India campaign to encourage domestic manufacturing. High tariffs apply not just to automobiles, but also industrial raw materials like steel and aluminum. India doesn’t have abundant supply of many raw materials needed to produce EV batteries, including lithium and nickel. That means Tesla would likely face high material costs if manufacturing EVs in India.
German carmaker Mercedes-Benz, which plans to roll out a locally made electric SUV called EQS in India this year, has complained that India’s “outrageous” import duties make it impossible to “localize all new technologies, including electric,” said Martin Schwenk, Mercedes’s India head, last year.
The Indian government is equally eager to grow the country’s EV market.

232,1-Jun-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Tesla Might Drive Away From India's EV Ambitions,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2671873111/BFD812D457A14912PQ/41?accountid=13946,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Tesla Inc. might drive away from India and the country has itself to blame.
On Friday, Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted that his company wouldn't put a plant anywhere it isn't first allowed to sell and service cars. His tweet was a response to a user asking about his plans to make electric cars in India.
For the past three years, India and Tesla have been sparring over market access and the conditions under which Tesla would consider manufacturing there. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government wants Tesla to make cars locally from the get-go. Mr. Musk wants lower automobile import taxes, which can be as high as 100%. Tesla appears to want to test the market with imported vehicles before committing to any production in India.
India's unwillingness to compromise looks shortsighted as China's tough Covid policies are pushing many foreign companies to get more serious about diversifying away from the world's factory floor. The Indian government might fear allowing Tesla to easily import cars would hinder plans to attract other EV makers to the country, but India's market for high-end EVs is minuscule.
Moreover, India might be on the cusp of losing out to nickel-rich Indonesia. Indonesia's president visited Mr. Musk in Texas in May. Bullish comments from Indonesia's investment minister, reported by local media after the visit, suggest negotiations for a Tesla plant in Indonesia might be under way. The Southeast Asian country attracted sizable investments in the EV-battery space from the likes of LG Energy Solution and China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co.
India wants EV sales to account for 30% of private cars and 70% of commercial vehicles by 2030, and unveiled incentives for manufacturing as well as demand. But despite the obvious potential and rapid growth, EV car sales remain very small for now: about 1% of total car sales, although two-wheel EVs are more popular. The average price of cars sold in India is about 926,708 Indian rupees, equivalent to $12,000, according to data from JATO Dynamics, an auto market research firm, versus the average cost of $52,200 for a Tesla.
India has some things going for it: a large population and low-cost labor. But it lacks advantages such as abundant raw materials for batteries. And success in attracting investment from other auto makers is a mixed bag so far. Mercedes-Benz plans to roll out a locally assembled EQS -- the electric version of its S-Class sedan -- this year. Ford recently dropped plans to make EVs in India.
If India dreams to compete with Southeast Asia, much less China, as an EV hub it either needs a large and lucrative domestic market or export-friendly policies. Snubbing the world's largest EV maker doesn't count.

233,1-Jun-22,USA Today (Online),Ford CEO says electric vehicles will be sold 100% online with nonnegotiable price,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2672066294/BFD812D457A14912PQ/326?accountid=13946,"Ford CEO Jim Farley said Wednesday that consumers should plan to see dramatic changes as companies compete amid the shift to electric vehicles. ""We've got to go to nonnegotiated price. – We've got to go to 100% online. There's no inventory (at dealerships), it goes directly to the customer. And 100% remote pick up and delivery,"" he said in New York during Bernstein's 38th Annual Strategic Decisions Conference streamed live. ""Then we have this opportunity to use our physical presence to outperform"" competitors, Farley said. ""I think our dealers can do it. But the standards are going to be brutal. They're going to be very different than they are today."" But that's not all.  Cars podcast: Ford CEO gets personal with Tom Brady, Jimmy Kimmel in new 'Drive' podcast EV for masses: Ford launches electric F-150 Lightning pickup An EV made just for Uber and Lyft He teased that the company sees potentially huge profits in building an electric vehicle for ride-hailing services Lyft and Uber. ""Shared mobility revenue will grow a lot,"" Farley said. ""No one has ever built a product for them."" Meanwhile, the way car companies generate revenue may change, too – like renting cars for limited use and allowing customers to pay per mile or per day, Farley said. General Motors early in the pandemic folded its Maven service that took such an approach.  Farley said he believes a Mustang Mach-E owner may want to use a Ford F-150 Lightning for the weekend. Farley forecasted dramatic industry changes, including:  ""We're going to see very large consolidation."" ""The Chinese will become more important ... China EV makers, if you look at a $25,000 build and material for an EV in China, it's probably the best in the world. And I think they're incredibly undervalued. They haven't shown any interest in exporting other than Norway.""  ""There's a shakeout coming. And I feel like that shakeout is going to favor many of the Chinese new players."" ""Old"" automakers ""absolutely will get consolidated. There will be some big winners, some people that transition, some won't. Many of the small players cannot afford to make this transition."" ""With capital tightening, there are new constraints that will make the new player better. But some of them won't be able to afford to fulfill their ambitions. Because they can't raise capital."" The next three or four years will shape the automotive future. Startups will be ""forced to solve tough problems like Tesla did"" with limited access to money. Robots in Austin: No driver: Fully autonomous cars now navigate some roads in Austin, Texas Aging fleet: The average age of a car in the US is up to 12.2 years, a new record. How old is yours? Consumer savings ahead The opportunity for profit within the next few years can't be overstated, he said. ""I think this is the most exciting kind of land grab of revenue in our industry since the Model T. I really believe that."" At the same time, Farley said, ""I believe our industry is definitely heading to a huge price war.""  The retail price war is already happening in China. Half of all electric vehicles in the world are sold there, and the most popular vehicle is an $8,000 van, he said.  'Angels sung' over Tesla profit When the second-quarter profit in 2021 came out from Tesla, ""it totally changed my world. It was an epiphany. It was, like, the angels sung."" It was confirmation that electric vehicles can make big money, Farley said. The electric vehicle maker established market dominance early, he noted.  ""The magic of Tesla,"" Farley said, ""is because they were capital constrained, they didn't have the money. They did things that we are too lazy to do."" Ford estimates that its distribution model is about $2,000 per vehicle more than Tesla, including one-third being inventory sitting on dealer lots, one-third or $500 to $600 per vehicle on public advertising. Farley didn't provide details of his order and delivery plan, but the concept appears to be similar to Tesla's. Tesla, which doesn't have a traditional dealer network, has a system for ordering a vehicle and completing other steps online, such as financing. Cars can be test driven from stores, and purchased vehicles generally are delivered to the customer. Back to work: Elon Musk reportedly demands Tesla, SpaceX employees return to the office Musk mania: Who is Elon Musk? What to know about the Tesla CEO who is set to buy Twitter Selling without advertising Sales and reservations of the Ford F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E SUV all happened without advertising campaigns, Farley noted. Meanwhile, Ford is working now with its dealers to focus on specialized service in a changing market. Farley noted that Tesla has dealerships in Norway, unlike the U.S., because customers in Norway wanted more service rather than sales. Farley is rethinking how everything is done and has been done, having seen that Mach-E ads needed to be pulled because they were sold out for two years, he said. ""Our model is messed up. We spend $600 or $700 on the vehicle to promote it and we spend nothing post-warranty on the customer experience. The problem is, on a parts business, which historically has been very profitable, we only get, maybe, only 10 or 20% of the customers come back to us."" It would be better to provide customer experiences such as complimentary vehicle detailing and software updates, he said. But the key is building loyalty among current customers ""instead of doing Super Bowl ads."" ""If you ever see Ford Motor Co. doing a Super Bowl ad on our electric vehicles, sell the stock."" Citing Target versus online retailer Amazon, Farley noted that customers want in-person customer assistance. The brick-and-mortar company expanded services and added an important digital component to remain competitive. ""Target could have gone away and didn't,"" he said. Super Duty remains  Farley emphasized that Ford plans to continue investing in gasoline-powered vehicles, noting that the Super Duty pickup trucks generate huge revenue for the company and battery technology isn't yet advanced enough to pivot. ""If you're a Super Duty customer towing 10,000 pounds in Montana or on the north slope of Alaska,"" he said, ""an electric vehicle is an awful solution. The batteries are too heavy."" Still, Ford is spending $5 billion on battery electric vehicles in 2022, Ford chief financial officer John Lawler said in a taped message played at the conference.

234,2-Jun-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk Tells Tesla, SpaceX Employees to Return to the Office; Workers must spend at least 40 hours a week in person, Mr. Musk says",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2672379950/BFD812D457A14912PQ/161?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk wants Tesla Inc. and SpaceX employees back in the office.
The electric-vehicle maker's employees are required to spend at least 40 hours a week in company offices, the Tesla boss said this week in an email to staff that was confirmed by The Wall Street Journal. He had the same message for staff of rocket company Space Exploration Technologies Corp., as SpaceX is formally known, according to an email obtained by the Journal.
""Tesla has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company on Earth,"" Mr. Musk wrote. ""This will not happen by phoning it in."" SpaceX employees received a similar message.
The email was earlier reported by Electrek, a site that covers electric-vehicle news. Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. SpaceX didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday about the email, which was reported earlier by the New York Times.
Employees who don't want to return to the office could seek employment elsewhere, Mr. Musk suggested in a tweet . ""They should pretend to work somewhere else,"" he said.
Mr. Musk's hard-line stance on in-person work differs from much of Silicon Valley, where flexible work policies became commonplace during the Covid-19 pandemic. Tesla moved its headquarters to Texas last year, but much of its staff remains in the San Francisco Bay Area, home to the company's first factory.
Mr. Musk said senior staff in particular should be visible to employees. He invoked his prepandemic experience sleeping on the floor of Tesla's San Francisco Bay Area factory when the company was struggling with production in 2018.
Amazon.com Inc., which also has a mix of blue- and white-collar staff, said decisions about how much time corporate staff should spend in the office would be left to directors of individual teams.
General Motors Co. has told employees whose jobs don't require them to be on-site that they can decide with their manager where they will work most effectively. Ford Motor Co. has a similar approach, allowing people who don't need to be on-site to work flexibly.
Some employers that were eager to get people back to offices have reconsidered some of those plans as the pandemic has dragged on and workers have leveraged a hot labor market to demand more flexible schedules . Apple Inc. last month put a pause on plans to bring employees back to the office an extra day a week.
Some other CEOs have expressed similar sentiments as Mr. Musk, linking office presence to a commitment to work hard .
Mr. Musk has bristled before at how Covid-19 has affected the workplace. In the early days of the pandemic, when local authorities in California ordered nonessential businesses to close and people to shelter at home to stop the virus from spreading, Mr. Musk argued that the risk of panic over the coronavirus exceeded the risk from the virus itself. ""Give people back their goddamn freedom,"" he said.
He suggested in a tweet last week that he thinks workers have been slacking off at home. ""Also, all the Covid stay-at-home stuff has tricked people into thinking that you don't actually need to work hard. Rude awakening inbound!"" he said.

 Elon Musk Tells Tesla, SpaceX Employees to Return to the Office

235,2-Jun-22,The Washington Post,In Musk they trust: Investors are flocking to help fund Twitter takeover,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2672182389/BFD812D457A14912PQ/446?accountid=13946,"A growing list of investors signing up to help fund the $44 billion takeover of Twitter are betting on one big thing: Elon Musk.
Though Twitter has spent years as an underperforming Silicon Valley punching bag, investors big and small are now scrambling for a piece of it, driven by optimistic revenue projections, their own strategic interests and fierce loyalty to a tech executive many see as infallible.
It's unclear whether political motivations play a role in enthusiasm for the 16-year-old public company, though some of the deal's backers appear to share Musk's view that Twitter displays an anti-conservative bias and that its content moderation policies should be weakened in the name of free speech.
Backers include some of Silicon Valley's most prominent venture capitalists, successful entrepreneurs and small-time investors who've pooled their money together, according to people familiar with the deal, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions, as well as documents describing the effort to attract investors. Some are forming special-purpose vehicles, or syndicates, that aim to steer money to Musk's bid through investing via larger firms directly connected to the deal.
The bid is attracting international interests as well, drawing scrutiny from national security regulators, according to one of the people familiar with the deal. All have faith that Musk's latest venture will deliver benefits down the line.
""There's a group of investors that will support Elon in anything he wants to do,"" said Adam Hardej, director of private markets at start-up crowdfunding company Stonks, which garnered $20 million worth of investor interest in the deal in May - though the funding has not been committed. ""What people miss is that there's a very solid case for Twitter to go private that has nothing to do with Elon.""
The investors signing up are confident the deal will proceed, according to the people, despite Musk recently telling his more than 90 million Twitter followers the deal is on hold. Musk is personally vetting and approving each investor, according to one of the people.
After initially offering to acquire Twitter, Musk has seen his wealth take a hit with the drop in the stock market. He has committed more than $33 billion to buy Twitter, significantly more than his initial $21 billion equity commitment - lowering the amount of debt he would have to pull from banks to reach the agreed-upon price. The investors he has attracted would contribute to the equity batch, lowering his debt burden.
A significant portion of Musk's war chest is tied up in shares of Tesla, the electric car company he runs. As a result, according to people briefed on the deal, he has been seeking outside investors to offset his costs.
More than a dozen investors have signed on. The world's richest person has already received commitments of $1.2 billion from top Silicon Valley venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, and $1 billion from old friend and Tesla board member Larry Ellison.
And a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing said former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey - who stepped down in November - might be interested in converting his large amount of equity in Twitter when it goes private.
Musk did not respond to a request for comment. Twitter declined to comment for this report.
With around 229 million active daily users, Twitter is much smaller than competing social networks such as Facebook and TikTok, which are used by billions. But Twitter punches well above its weight in terms of influence because it is used so frequently by celebrities, journalists and political figures. The company has been criticized for its slow pace of growth, and it has been hamstrung because its advertising revenue lags behind its peers.
Musk, however, is seen by many investors in Silicon Valley as a potential savior - a turnaround specialist with a record of execution, who will have a personal stake in Twitter's success. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO is one of the most high-profile and prolific users on the site, often posting multiple times daily. He uses the service to relay updates on his companies to his legions of fans and followers, make jokes and share memes, and telegraph personal interests and political views.
Now Musk has pitched prospective investors on an ambitious plan to unlock three to four times Twitter's usual revenue - which comes primarily from advertising - through aggressive efforts to monetize the platform, according to projections shared among investors and viewed by The Washington Post.
The pitch deck shared with prospective investors by Stonks projects that a Musk-owned Twitter would make $16.8 billion from advertising in year five. Twitter's revenue was just over $5 billion last year.
While Musk has no experience running a company reliant on advertising, investors say his track record proves he has the capacity to unlock previously unthinkable amounts of value with his companies - chiefly Tesla, which went from a niche start-up to the world's most valuable automaker in just over a decade of delivering cars.
Still, the people said, it means investors are in some ways applying the same logic to the social media giant normally reserved for start-ups - when profit and loss projections aren't as important as the vision for the business and the track record and personality of those behind it.
Musk has framed his decision to acquire Twitter in ideological terms. Like many entrepreneurs who earned their fortunes in Silicon Valley over the past 20 years, Musk says he is perturbed by the control large companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter have over public discourse. He has called Twitter's decision to ban Donald Trump a mistake and vowed to reverse it.
Ellison, who made his fortune by co-founding the database technology company Oracle, is a stalwart Trump supporter. A person who works with Ellison, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said that Ellison would not spend a billion dollars if he didn't think he could make a return.
""No matter what you think of Elon, he's an out-of-the-box thinker that Larry likes,"" said the person, who added they had no specific knowledge of the deal. ""As for the business piece of it, Twitter is undervalued.""
Meanwhile, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz has been investing in new companies and cryptocurrency technologies that help ""creators"" deliver content directly to consumers, circumventing gatekeepers like traditional publishers. The firm's co-founder, Marc Andreessen, has been an outspoken critic of online censorship. (Andreessen is on the board of rival Facebook, potentially setting up another conflict with his firm's Twitter stake).
Twitter is attractive in part because of its value as a megaphone. ""It's essentially buying the marketing department,"" a person familiar with the investors involved in the deal said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to not alienate friends. That motivation might be particularly important for those invested in cryptocurrency, the person said.
Andreessen declined to comment.
Venture capital firm Sequoia's global managing partner, Doug Leone, was also a prominent Trump ally but broke with the former president over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, according to his public statements. Several Sequoia partners, with differing political viewpoints, committed funding to take Twitter private, according to a person familiar with the organization's strategy who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential matters.
Sequoia also led the first financing round for X.com, an online bank Musk co-founded in 1999. Sequoia invested as well in Musk's SpaceX and Boring, a tunneling firm.
""For over two decades, we've had a front-row seat to Elon's business and technical prowess,"" Sequoia spokeswoman Natalie Miyake said in a statement. ""We see, as he does, the opportunity to drive meaningful product innovation that will help unlock Twitter's full potential as a global platform that connects the world.""
Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal al Saud and Chinese crypto firm Binance are included in the round of financing. Neither responded to requests for comment.
According to the Stonks pitch deck, Musk aims to reduce ""head count and costs across a bloated organization,"" growing the ads business and introducing and emphasizing areas such as subscriptions, payments and monetizing the creator economy. The pitch deck also urged caution, underscoring the volatility of the deal.
""Nothing is certain … you could still lose everything if you YOLO on this investment,"" read the slide deck, a reference to the saying ""you only live once.""
If the total number of investors in the deal reaches 2,000, Twitter would be required to disclose its financials to the SEC, even if it remains private.
""Whether you think it's good business or not - this is as engaged as people have been in an acquisition like this and it's a step in the right direction for private market deals that are typically unavailable to everyday investors,"" Hardej said.

236,3-Jun-22,Barron's (Online),"The Dow Dropped After the Jobs Report, Tesla Slipped—and What Else Happened in the Stock Market Today",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2672618377/BFD812D457A14912PQ/16?accountid=13946,"The stock market ended the week down after a nasty Friday. The U.S. economy added more jobs than expected in May , suggesting that the Federal Reserve may have to remain aggressive with its rate hikes.
Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 349 points, or 1.1%, while the S&P 500 was down 1.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.5%.
For the week, the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq ultimately dropped 1.2%, 0.9% and 1%, respectively, as Friday couldn't bring gains on the indexes. Friday's job report ruined the stock market's recent rally, which lasted several weeks and saw big gains.
""The jobs report reinforces the strength of the overall economy, but also indicates the Fed still has their work cut out for them,"" writes Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.
The U.S. added 390,000 jobs in May, above expectations for 328,000. The March and April jobs results were revised down by a net 22,000. The unemployment rate remained at 3.6%.
Wages rose 0.3% month-over-month, below the expected gain of 0.4%. The year-over-year gain in wages was 5.2%, down from 5.5% in the prior jobs report.
More jobs added and higher wages are signs of a strong economy, but the concern is that inflation will remain close to its recent peak. More hiring means more people are earning incomes and keeping prices elevated. Rising wages also indicate that companies will continue to raise prices at a fast clip to protect their profit margins. Declining inflation had become evident in May, which pushed along the narrative that the Federal Reserve could slow down the pace of rate hikes .
The good news is that wage gains were lower than expected. ""This is consistent with the peak inflation narrative; at least for the time being,"" wrote Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO.
Others agree, yet there's a caveat. ""The deceleration in wage growth is encouraging because it suggests that the broader cyclical price pressures in the economy are close to peaking,"" wrote Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics. ""But it will take a slowdown in annual wage growth to closer to 4% before the Fed can claim it is making significant progress toward its inflation goal.""
The bond market certainly sees a slightly higher likelihood that the Fed will keep raising rates at a brisk pace. The 2-year Treasury yield, which attempts to forecast the level of the federal-funds rate a couple of years from the present, rose from a 2.63% close on Thursday to 2.67% on Friday. The 10-year yield, meanwhile, rose from 2.92% just before the jobs report to 2.95%.
While those rates are below their recent peaks, they're heading back in that direction. ""There is some repositioning here by those that got long ahead of it [jobs report] because it just reinforces the aggressive Fed response,"" wrote Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.
The same might be true for stock investors that had gotten too optimistic. The S&P 500 had gained almost 10% from its intraday low for the year hit on May 20 to Thursday's close. That gain was partly predicated on the narrative that called for declining inflation and a less aggressive Fed. The May jobs report doesn't seem to fully validate that thesis.
While there were signals in the jobs report that inflation is cooling down, it's not declining by much. ""There are encouraging signs,"" said Marvin Loh, senior macro strategist at State Street. ""It's [lower inflation] just this slow, iterative process.""
One of the major concerns is about corporate earnings. Higher rates and slower economic growth likely means slower earnings growth. With aggregate 2022 S&P 500 earnings per share estimates still up for the year according to FactSet, ""we think the market is going to have to go through an earnings reckoning,"" says Shawn Snyder, Head of Investment Strategy at Citi U.S. Wealth Management.
Also weighing on stocks before the release of the jobs data was a report that said Tesla (ticker: TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk wanted to cut 10% of staff at the electric-vehicle maker, making it just the latest tech company looking to pare its workforce. Tesla stock fell 9.2%.
Here are some stocks on the move Friday:
Lululemon Athletica (LULU) initially rose, before finishing down 0.6% after the company delivered an upbeat fiscal first-quarter report and full-year earnings forecast.
Okta (OKTA) jumped 5%. The identity-management software company posted better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results and raised its forecast for the year.
RH (RH) gained 0.9% after the home furnishings retailer issued a weak full-year outlook but posted strong quarterly earnings.
Shares of security software provider CrowdStrike (CRWD) fell 6.9% even after the company posted better-than-expected quarterly adjusted earnings and boosted its full-year outlook .
Turning Point Therapeutics (TPTX) stock gained 118.4% after an announcement that Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) will buy the company for $4.1 billion. The company's market cap before it was announced that it will be acquired was just over $1 billion.

237,3-Jun-22,USA Today (Online),'Lots of luck on his trip to the moon': Biden dismisses Elon Musk's 'super bad feeling' about the economy,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2672744523/BFD812D457A14912PQ/260?accountid=13946,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Friday dismissed Tesla CEO Elon Musk's ""super bad feeling"" about the economy that is reportedly prompting the electric vehicle company to cut 10% of its workforce. ""Lots of luck on his trip to the moon,"" Biden said after reeling off names of car and technology companies that are hiring more workers. ""I mean, I don't know."" Musk has increasingly warned about risks of a recession, and according to a report from Reuters, the billionaire CEO told Tesla executives Thursday he needs to cut about 10% of Tesla jobs because of his ""super bad feeling."" The electric carmaker employed about 100,000 people at the end of 2021. 'Paying the price': Biden and top aides misread threat of inflation as warning signs gathered Biden, responding to a reporter's question about Musk's plans, pointed to other companies that are expanding.  ""While Elon Musk is talking about that, Ford is increasing their investment overwhelmingly,"" Biden said, referring to Ford's announcement Thursday of a $3.7 billion investment in Ohio, Michigan and Missouri to hire 6,000 workers focused mostly on electric vehicle production.  The president touted other electric vehicle investments from Chrysler and plans from Intel, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, to build a $20 billion complex outside Columbus, Ohio. More: Ford investing $3.7B to create 6,200 jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Missouri The exchange came as the White House faces increasing pressure to address economic concerns amid 40-year high inflation. Biden's ""trip to the moon"" remark appeared aimed at Musk's goal for his space company to be prepared for a moon voyage by 2024. ""Thanks Mr. President!"" Musk responded in a Tweet shortly after the president's comments, linking to a 2021 NASA announcement of its partnership with his company SpaceX to send astronauts to the moon. Musk, a frequent critic of Biden and Democrats, has a complicated relationship with the White House. As the leading manufacturer of electric vehicles, Tesla is the poster child for the transition from carbon-emitting vehicles that Biden often talks about. But Musk opposes unions, which the president supports, and has taken repeated shots at Biden's presidency.  What is Biden's take on Tesla?: White House straddles EV growth, union jobs as petition goes viral It took Biden more than one year in office to mention ""Tesla"" in a public speech, finally doing so in February. Tesla was not among was auto companies invited to the White House last August when Biden signed an executive order with the goal of zero-emissions vehicles accounting for half of all automobiles sold in the U.S. by 2030. Biden's remarks came after he delivered a speech touting a positive new jobs report that showed 390,000 jobs were added in May, maintaining a low unemployment rate of 3.6%.  Speaking in Rehoboth Beach, Del., where Biden is spending the weekend, the president said that ""even with today's good news"" he knows that ""Americans remain anxious"" because of high consumer prices. He said Americans should ""feel confident that we'll meet these challenges."" Although Biden did not directly mention fears of a recession, he said he's confident that steps to tame inflation won't come at the expense of jobs and other gains. ""We've laid an economic foundation that's historically strong, and now we're moving forward to a new moment where we can build on that foundation to build a future of stable, steady growth, so we can bring down inflation without sacrificing all the historic gains we've made.""

It also invited concern that he may drive away top performers who would prefer to continue working remotely some or all of the time.The new layoffs won't be the first ones at Tesla. The automaker also dismissed some workers in 2017 and 2018.In recent weeks, investors have begun questioning the company's sky-high stock price. The market values the company at more than $728 billion, more than several other large automakers combined. Tesla's shares are down about 40 percent from their high at the end of last year, bringing attention to the risks the company faces from growing competition, accusations of racial discrimination and production problems at its factory in Shanghai.Some critics view Mr. Musk's bid to buy Twitter as yet another distraction that could hurt Tesla. One big concern for some investors is that the automaker's board lacks enough independence from the chief executive to serve as a check on him and his impulses.""From a corporate good-governance perspective, Tesla has a lot of red flags,"" Andrew Poreda, a senior analyst who specializes in socially responsible investing at Sage Advisory Services, an investment firm in Austin, told The Times last month. ""There are almost no checks and balances.""Mr. Musk's management style and success -- he is listed as the world's richest man by Bloomberg and Forbes -- have earned him admirers but have made him a lightning rod. Tesla has lost a number of top executives in recent years, many of whom have gone on to top jobs at other automakers, tech companies and battery makers.Recently, Mr. Musk praised the work ethic in China, where labor conditions can be harsh or even abusive, suggesting that workers in the United States were lazy. ""They won't just be burning the midnight oil. They'll be burning the 3 a.m. oil,"" he said about Chinese workers in an interview with The Financial Times. ""So they won't even leave the factory type of thing. Whereas in America, people are trying to avoid going to work at all.""Still, some analysts remain bullish about Tesla's prospects. ""In our view, Tesla likely does not need to hire any more employees to maintain its growth, and we think the plan to reduce the work force likely shows that Tesla over hired last year,"" Seth Goldstein, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said in a note on Friday.PhotographModel Y cars at the opening ceremony for Tesla's factory in Germany in March.

239,4-Jun-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk Says Tesla Plans to Cut 10% of Salaried Staff; CEO's plan to shed employees draws negative response from President Biden,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2673019520/BFD812D457A14912PQ/147?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc. plans to cut 10% of its salaried workforce amid concerns about the global economy and following a hiring spree that has seen the company's head count swell 45% in one year alone.
Chief Executive Elon Musk informed workers about the head-count reduction in a memo, saying Friday the electric auto maker had ""become overstaffed in many areas,"" according to people familiar with the email.
Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. Reuters earlier reported on Mr. Musk's plan to cut staff.
Mr. Musk added that the effort wouldn't apply to workers building cars and battery packs or installing solar panels, noting that the hourly workforce would increase. Tesla is racing to ramp up production at two new assembly plants in Germany and Texas.
The Tesla boss, in responding to a tweet on Saturday, suggested that the auto maker's total workforce would increase over the coming year though salaried staff levels ""should be fairly flat."" He didn't say how plans to keep the number of salaried staff broadly flat related to his earlier memo on job cuts. Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Musk's Saturday tweet.
Shares of the company slid 9.2% Friday. Mr. Musk's dire outlook also drew a response from President Biden during an unrelated press conference.
The president pointed to plans by Ford Motor Co. and Intel Corp. to boost their hiring. ""You know, lots of luck on his trip to the moon,"" Mr. Biden said of Mr. Musk, who has been vocal this year in complaints about the president.
 Mr. Musk shortly after tweeted ""Thanks Mr President!"" The tweet included an artist's rendering of a SpaceX rocket on the moon and linked to a NASA 2021 press release announcing a $2.9 billion contract for the company to carry astronauts to the lunar surface. Mr. Musk also runs Space Exploration Technologies Corp., as SpaceX is formally known.
Mr. Musk has sparred with the White House before, arguing the administration has favored unionized auto makers over Tesla. The billionaire has also bristled at tax proposals aimed at the most wealthy Americans and some of the administration's spending plans.
Last month, Mr. Musk suggested on Twitter the economy was headed toward recession that could last 12 months to 18 months based on past experience. The downturn, he said, could cause some companies to fold, he said, an idea he cheered. ""Companies that are inherently negative cash flow (ie value destroyers) need to die, so that they stop consuming resources,"" Mr. Musk tweeted, adding, ""this is actually a good thing.""
Mr. Musk, on an earnings call in April said Tesla was bracing for higher supplier and logistic costs amid soaring inflation. ""We're seeing suppliers request 20% to 30% cost increases for parts from last year to the end of this year. So there's a lot of cost pressure there,"" he said, adding the company had raised vehicle prices to help offset some of those costs.
Tesla ended 2021 with 100,000 workers, 39% of whom were production workers, according to a regulatory filing. That would suggest about 6,000 salaried workers might be affected by the cuts announced Friday.
The company had 69,000 workers at the end of 2020. Its hiring boom reflected ambitious, multiyear sales growth goals that Mr. Musk has set and that could someday make Tesla the world's bestselling car maker.
Tesla has been the bright spot in the car industry where U.S. auto sales have fallen 19% this year through May while the Austin, Texas-based electric car company has boosted deliveries 88%, according to estimates by research firm Wards Intelligence.
The electric vehicle maker also has had to contend with production turmoil, though, particularly in China, where governmental Covid-19 restrictions have curtailed output at the company's largest plant by volume. Tesla was among the hardest hit in April. It sold just 1,512 cars made at its Shanghai plant, down 94% from a year ago.
Tesla's market value has soared during the past two years in part because of Mr. Musk's ability to navigate the Covid-19 pandemic that has disrupted production of its rivals. He has been a vocal critic of how U.S. officials have handled the health crisis with shutdowns, including attacking California officials when they shut down Tesla's San Francisco area assembly plant in 2020.
In recent days, Mr. Musk told employees at Tesla and SpaceX that they had to return to the office at least 40 hours a week or seek employment elsewhere.
Tesla's 18-year history has been punctuated with several near-death experiences, and workers have seen many rounds of hiring booms and head count reductions. The success of the Model 3 compact car and Model Y compact sport-utility vehicle have helped change Tesla's fortune, transforming it from a niche luxury player to a mass-market auto maker.
For years, investors fretted about Tesla's cash levels as it dipped to dangerously low levels. That has changed as the company has shown several quarters of continued profitability, paid down most of its debt and raised a large cushion of cash that could help weather a downturn.
Still, the car business can eat cash quickly in an economic slowdown when sales stall, costs mount and growth plans are disrupted.
Mr. Musk has moved swiftly to cut costs before when signs of economic trouble emerge. Early in the pandemic, Tesla sought rent cuts from some of its landlords to help make it through the crisis.

240,5-Jun-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk's Bot Problem on Twitter Is Extraordinary; A habitual tweeter with nearly 100 million followers, the Tesla CEO is 'an outlier among outliers'",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2673092898/BFD812D457A14912PQ/168?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk's battle with bots on Twitter is personal.
In the three weeks since Mr. Musk cited fake accounts as a reason for putting his planned $44 billion acquisition of Twitter Inc. ""on hold,"" observers and participants in the deal have puzzled over the thinking behind the tycoon's comments. The issue isn't new for Mr. Musk , who has complained for years about Twitter's ability to measure and manage automated accounts on the platform that often produce spam.
Whatever his intention in raising the issue, it is clear that Mr. Musk has had unusually extensive interactions with bots. As a habitual tweeter with more than 95 million followers, the Tesla Inc. CEO likely has far greater exposure and experience with fake and spam accounts than most on the social-media platform, researchers say. One estimate says spam, fake or inactive accounts make up the vast majority of his followers.
Mr. Musk is ""an outlier among outliers,"" said Darius Kazemi, a computer programmer who has spent a decade creating and studying bots and is currently a senior software engineer at Meedan, a technology nonprofit that aims to combat misinformation. ""His experience is going to be different from not just the average user, but the average celebrity.""
Mr. Musk didn't respond to requests for comment. Twitter declined to comment for this article but has defended its fight against spam accounts .
Researchers say Mr. Musk's prominence and interaction with other users, as well as the topics he tweets about, make him a magnet for people looking to spread spam and other suspicious content. He has tweeted nearly every day for the past four years, and most of his tweets are mentions of or replies to other users, which encourages attention-seekers—human and bot alike—to reply to him.
Others with huge follower counts—such as former President Barack Obama, singer Justin Bieber and soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo—don't tweet as often or engage as much.
 PHOTOS: How Elon Musk Made the Fortune He'll Need to Buy Twitter 
Spam and fake accounts are an industrywide problem and can cause problems for advertisers and bad experiences for users. The accounts can be difficult to detect and are commonly managed by bots, which are computer programs that can automate posts and replies. Many bots have been programmed to achieve illicit goals, such as spreading false information and tricking people into spending money, tech and social-media analysts say, but others have more benign purposes, such as sharing news and weather alerts.
Mr. Musk's sudden escalation of the bot issue last month raised suspicions among observers that he is using it as a negotiating tactic to lower the price amid the swooning market, or exit the takeover deal. That's partly because he has complained about fake accounts on Twitter for years—long before he agreed to buy the platform in late April, as part of which he waived detailed due diligence on the deal. In 2018, he tweeted , ""Lots of fake accounts on Twitter characterized by high following/follower ratio to make it seem like many real people when it isn't. Wonder why.""
Mr. Musk's feed is flooded with tweets hawking products, requesting money and pushing political agendas from what may be bots, coordinated groups or individuals. Replies to a recent tweet from Mr. Musk about computer programming, for example, touted new digital currencies for pet owners and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community. Some bots are transparent, including one whose bio says it is automated to explain tweets in simpler words.
Outside estimates of the share of bogus accounts on Twitter vary—and all suffer from a lack of access to the company's data. But whatever the overall percentage, industry experts say it's most likely far higher for Mr. Musk.
Around 70% of Mr. Musk's followers on Twitter are spam, fake or inactive, versus 41% for all other accounts with between 65 million and 120 million followers, according to an estimate last month from SparkToro LLC, a maker of audience-research software. Across the company's data set, the average Twitter user has fewer than 100 followers and fewer than 10% are fake or spam accounts, the study showed.
Mr. Musk is ""attracting so much attention that people may be trying to use him to find targets to scam,"" said Kaicheng Yang, a computer scientist and Ph.D. candidate at Indiana University who researches bot activity on social media and helped build a bot-detection tool called Botometer. ""If I'm a scammer, would I look at the average user? No.""
Twitter says it battles fake and spam accounts aggressively and suspends and blocks millions of accounts each week. It has long estimated that false or spam accounts represent fewer than 5% of its monetizable daily active usage or users—the number, most recently pegged at 229 million, that it emphasizes to advertisers.
Mr. Musk has questioned that estimate and voiced suspicion that the real share is far higher. He recently called Twitter's rules ""very bot friendly."" On Saturday he brought attention to a tweet suggesting spam and bots were being used for ""misinformation and fake news against Elon."" Mr. Musk's one-word reply to the tweet , ""Interesting,"" got close to 20,000 likes.
Twitter has stood by its tally. ""We don't believe that this specific estimation can be performed externally, given the critical need to use both public and private information (which we can't share),"" Twitter's chief executive, Parag Agrawal, tweeted last month in response to Mr. Musk's remarks about putting the deal on hold due to doubts about the company's bot estimates. Mr. Musk responded by tweeting a poop emoji.
""Anyone who uses Twitter is well aware that the comment threads are full of spam, scam and just a lot of fake accounts,"" Mr. Musk said at a mid-May tech conference called the All-In Summit .
Marketing executives have said advertisers are aware of the presence of automated and spam accounts on social media—not just Twitter—and factor that into their strategies and measurements .
Whatever Mr. Musk's intention, bad bots and fake accounts can pose a threat on Twitter such as by making an issue look like it is trending or influencing behavior, tech and social media experts say.
""Suddenly something that was fake popular becomes real popular,"" said Sandy Carielli, a principal analyst at Forrester Research Inc. ""While I would not speculate about Musk's motivation for elevating the problem, he's right it's a problem.""

 Elon Musk's Bot Problem on Twitter Is Extraordinary

241,5-Jun-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Elon Musk Masks Dysfunction With Hype: [Op-Ed],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2673046467/BFD812D457A14912PQ/332?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk's repeated wavering on his deal to buy Twitter has roiled markets and raised fresh questions about his seriousness. His promises to preserve free speech, ban spam bots and dramatically boost revenue may have earned the blessing of the company's founder, Jack Dorsey, but with Twitter's stock falling well below his offer price, Mr. Musk appears to be reneging on a deal that has made even Wall Street grow skeptical.For those of us who have followed Mr. Musk's antics for some time, the latest twist in his bid for the social media platform is entirely in character. The way that he has managed and marketed his businesses from Tesla's early days reveals a dysfunction behind the automaker's veneer of technofuturism and past stock market successes. Often announcing new features without consultation with his team, he forces his employees to bridge the enormous gap between technological reality and his dreams. This disconnect fosters a negligent and sometimes cruel workplace, to disastrous effect.In 2016, Mr. Musk promised that newly made Teslas would be able to drive themselves with nothing more than a future software update that Tesla owners could buy in advance for thousands of dollars.That fully self-driving announcement that so delighted his fans came as a far more jarring revelation to the project's engineers, who found out about their staggering new mission when Mr. Musk tweeted about it. Tesla buyers never got the promised software update. The cars still cannot drive themselves without humans. But every year since then, he has repeated different versions of this claim. His ability to repeatedly sell such science fiction fantasies to a credulous public is the foundation for a vast empire and fortune.Tesla's manufacturing engineers were aghast when, also in 2016, Mr. Musk publicly committed to developing a fully automated factory that required no human workers. Tesla built two assembly lines that attempted to automate tasks requiring levels of dexterity and flexibility that modern robotics is still far from attaining. He ultimately gave up and cobbled together a manual-labor-intensive production line in an open-air tent.Mr. Musk took this as a new opportunity to build his legend, and he reported that he had slept in Tesla's factories during this period, which he called ""production hell."" What he left out of his self-aggrandizing was the reality for his employees. His presence brought no real manufacturing expertise to bear, just the overbearing pressure of a boss whose public shaming was punctuated by declarations like ""I can be on my own private island with naked supermodels, drinking mai tais -- but I'm not.""In my reporting on Tesla, interviewing employees at times felt more as if I had been a therapist than a journalist, as they sought to untangle the pride and satisfaction they felt about their work from the trauma of working for Mr. Musk. Surviving 10 years of the grind at Tesla is a rare achievement, and it is common for talent to be squeezed dry or pushed out before the end of the company's four-year stock vesting period.This grim environment is all the more pronounced for women and racial minorities. Lawsuits by workers and California's Department of Fair Employment and Housing allege that Black workers were tasked with menial physical labor in parts of the factory nicknamed ""the plantation,"" where they were subjected to racist slurs and graffiti. Female workers have sued, alleging a pervasive culture of sexual harassment and groping by supervisors. Mr. Musk was indifferent, emailing workers who experienced abuse that ""it is important to be thick-skinned.""Mr. Musk's interest lies in supervising entrepreneurial projects that result in flashy new components. In more prosaic areas of the business like manufacturing, service and sales, he tends to get involved only in order to put out the fires that regularly threaten the company's immediate future (though not the literal fires that have repeatedly ravaged its Fremont, Calif., factory over the years).This is the fundamental weakness of every organization run as a cult of personality: The dear leader can't be everywhere or make every decision but often fails to provide the clear code of values that allows managers to independently shape their decisions around common goals. When the success of the company is tied to one man's whims, you get bizarre phenomena like managers deciding whether or not to take issues to Mr. Musk based on the shade of blond of his wife's hair that day (with platinum shades being correlated with better moods).When the boss happens to run tunneling, rocket and brain-implant companies in addition to a high-profile car company, even the most brilliant minds will occasionally be too disconnected from the realities of the decisions that they must make. After the collapses of Theranos and WeWork -- companies with similarly confident founders who insisted that they would achieve their soaring ambitions if given more time and money -- Mr. Musk's reliance on hype is especially jarring.Indeed, the main difference between Mr. Musk and Silicon Valley's fallen heroes is that he has been able to deliver on some promises: Tesla does make cars, and SpaceX does land rockets. But as a number of old promises like fully self-driving cars appear to be more aspirational and less plausible, the distinction between him and those fallen heroes is starting to lose its meaning. His long list of unfulfilled commitments -- a fully solar-powered electric vehicle charging network, a fully automated manufacturing system, an autonomous minibus and even a rocket-powered flying car -- wildly exceed his achievements.By moving to buy Twitter, Mr. Musk has not only added another distraction to his long list but has also already shown the same drive to announce sweeping decisions in public. While he had some success in realizing user features at Tesla, his contradictory goals of increasing algorithmic transparency and eliminating spam bots on Twitter are the most obvious sign that he intends to impose his will on the service without drawing on the expertise of workers who have been wrestling with Twitter's thorniest challenges.Ultimately Mr. Musk's goals for Twitter, as they are for Tesla, are not about making the right decisions for his companies or the people who make them possible. They are about playing to the crowd and burnishing the legend that keeps fresh bodies and minds moving through the businesses that chew them up and spit them out. Now if Twitter falls into his control, Mr. Musk will have seized the means of making the product he has always cared about most: his own myth making.Edward Niedermeyer (@Tweetermeyer) is the author of ""Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors"" and a co-host of ""The Autonocast,"" a podcast about driving automation technology and the future of mobility.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

242,5-Jun-22,Chicago Tribune,Ford changes its own game: Lightning re-imagines the pickup as utility vehicle and mobile generator,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2673069906/BFD812D457A14912PQ/452?accountid=13946,"Ford birthed its electric vehicle program in late 2017. It's no coincidence the date dovetailed with first deliveries of the Tesla Model 3. The Silicon Valley startup had changed the electric game with its $40,000, 220-mile range electric sedan. Delivered less than two years since it was first introduced by CEO Elon Musk in April 2016 to an unprecedented 200,000-plus pre-orders, the Model 3 headlined a clean-energy portfolio that included home-battery energy storage and solar roof tiles.Ford realized that it needed to change its own game to compete.The result was Team Edison, a startup auto company within Ford to mimic Tesla. A little over four years later and with 200,000 pre-orders, Ford's F-150 Lightning EV pickup truck headlines a new Ford Motor Co. business model offering electric vehicles as well as battery-powered energy solutions for the home, not unlike Elon Musk's startup.""Our competitor is Tesla,"" Ford Vice President for global EVs Darren Palmer in San Antonio at the Lighting's media test. ""We see our brand to be an electric-vehicles and an electric-energy company.""The Lightning is the result of a comprehensive process to re-imagine the pickup as a utility vehicle and a mobile generator in a fraught energy landscape.""We worked like a startup because we were competing against startups,"" said Palmer. ""You could see EVs were really coming of age. We didn't know what customers wanted, so the first thing we did was go out and see customers in California, Norway, China, Europe. Customers really opened our eyes to what we needed (and how) to make use of the new technology to do new things that customers had never seen before.""New things like a front truck -- ""frunk"" -- that can hold two golf bags for a day on the Texas links. Or offer three days of generating power for the home during a California blackout.The Lightning debuts at a time when one of its key markets, California, is facing energy shortages this summer as the state shuts down baseload generation in its transition to green energy sources. ""Officials forecast a potential shortfall of 1,700-5,000 megawatts,"" reported Reuters during the Lightning's media rollout. ""Supply gaps along those lines could leave between 1 million and 4 million people without power.""Ford product experts used the opportunity to tout Lightning's unique abilities to operate as an electric generator for about the same $10,000 price as a permanent, natural-gas generator.""The Lightning can be used as an extended-range battery to power your home for three to 10 days,"" said Ford Energy Services Business Manager Ryan O'Gorman.He demonstrated a home setup connecting the truck to a Ford Charge Station Pro wall charger and Home Integration System -- consisting of a battery, power inverter and bi-directional electricity flow -- that immediately kicks in if the grid goes dark. He also touted cloud-based software that charges the Lightning during low-cost, off-peak hours -- then transfers that cheap electricity back to the house during peak, high-cost evening hours.Tesla's Powerwall pioneered the home-energy storage solution in 2015 -- storing energy from roof solar panels to power homes during peak hours. Ford takes the idea a step further by integrating its truck in the system.Ford's Palmer credits Team Edison's human-centric design focus for the company's new direction.""We were struggling to get going in electric vehicles in the right way,"" he said. ""We are an over 100-year old company, and as projects came forward they were being removed because they weren't meeting profit targets. You use the principle of human-centric design when it's not obvious what the future path is, when there is disruption.""Employing a diverse staff in age and product backgrounds, Team Edison hit the road to ask customers what they wanted from EVs. They trotted the globe to meet customers. They focused on re-imagining company icons by developing the electric F-150 Lightning, Mustang Mach-E and E-Transit van.For the F-150, they went to Texas, where 1 in 5 Ford pickups are sold.""(F-150's) the best-selling vehicle of any kind in America for decades. It could change people's relationship w EVs if we get it right. But we didn't know who wanted to buy this vehicle,"" said Palmer. ""So we made prototypes out of cardboard, we made up some brochures and we went to Texas.""Accompanied by a human-centric design specialist -- ""essentially a psychologist,"" said Palmer -- Team Edison confronted a group of hardened Texas truck drivers. The team got the truckers' attention with muscle-bound specs -- 560 horsepower, 775 foot-pounds of torque, 10,000-pound towing -- that embarrassed a gas-powered Raptor performance truck.""Then we showed them the frunk and what the frunk could be,"" said Palmer.Armed with customer demand, Team Edison constructed an all-new truck but that stayed true to what had made F-150 an essential tool to generations of truck buyers.Aft of the A-pillar (and frunk) were F-150's familiar aluminum body panels.The bed? ""Deliberately identical, because customers said their accessories needed to fit and they needed over 2,000 pounds of payload,"" said Ford's EV boss. Below decks the F-150 body sits on familiar, ladder-frame chassis construction, yet with all-new wheels, gearbox, motors, battery, steering and brakes.""It was designed to do what customers need ... starting at $39,974,"" said Palmer. ""We wanted to take all the excuses away for electric. It's a truck for everybody.""CAPTION: Photo: Ford's Chief Executive Engineer Linda Zhang unveils the Ford F-150 Lightning in Dearborn, Michigan.

243,6-Jun-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla Stock Jumped. Elon Musk May Back Away From the Twitter Deal.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2673351743/BFD812D457A14912PQ/100?accountid=13946,"Tesla stock jumped after Elon Musk filed a 13D stating that he could walk away from the agreement to buy Twitter because of its spam bot problem.
Tesla stock (ticker: TSLA) closed the day up 1.6%, to $714.84, though it had already been trading higher amid signs that EV demand in China was improving .
The S&P 500 rose 0.3% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1%.
Twitter shares (TWTR) fell 1.5%, to $39.56. Musk's potential purchase price is $54.20 a share.
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission read in part: ""On June 6, 2022, the Reporting Person delivered a letter to the Issuer reiterating his request for certain data and information necessary to facilitate his evaluation of spam and fake accounts on the Issuer's platform.""
Musk wants to better understand how much of Twitter's daily active usage is spam. Twitter said it's about 5%. Musk believes it's much higher. If it is higher that has implications for how much revenue can be generated on the platform. Twitter makes money by selling ads, and advertisers won't advertise to bots.
The letter attached to the SEC filing added: ""Based on Twitter's behavior to date , and the company's latest correspondence in particular, Mr. Musk believes the company is actively resisting and thwarting his information rights (and the company's corresponding obligations) under the merger agreement. This is a clear material breach of Twitter's obligations under the merger agreement and Mr. Musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom, including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement.""
The threat of not completing the deal is why Twitter stock was lower.
It's likely part of the reason Tesla shares were higher too. Tesla stock has fallen almost 40% since Musk's initial stake in Twitter was announced. The threat of management distraction might be one reason Tesla investors have a less-than-favorable opinion of the deal.
Other things have impacted Tesla stock as well, including Covid lockdowns in China that have hindered production at Tesla's Shanghai plant. The overall market is much weaker too. The Nasdaq Composite is down about 17% since Musk's stake in Twitter was disclosed.
Adjusted for regular trading volatility , Tesla investors might have expected Tesla stock to drop roughly 30% with the Nasdaq off that much. The extra few percentage points of underperformance can be attributed to Tesla-specific issues, including the Twitter overhang.

244,6-Jun-22,Los Angeles Times,BUSINESS; Is Musk's dim economic view shared? Tesla chief cites 'super bad feelings' for 10% cut in salaried staff. But some experts see no cause for alarm.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2673264578/BFD812D457A14912PQ/188?accountid=13946,"Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has announced plans to cut 10% of the electric-car maker's salaried workforce because he has a dire view of where the economy is headed -- a projection that raised alarms as to whether other companies will do the same.
Not so fast, economists say.
""Broadly, even the tech sector continues to hire, manufacturing is incredibly strong right now, and consumption and business investment is strong in the U.S., even as the U.S. Fed is increasing interest rates to control inflation,"" said Leo Feler, a senior economist at UCLA Anderson Forecast.

U.S. employment numbers released Friday showed that the economy continues to add a healthy number of jobs. Although some sectors have seen job cuts in recent months, the moves seem to be confined for now to companies that boomed during the pandemic -- for example, Peloton and Netflix -- then had to quickly adjust to curtailed revenue, or to tech companies hit by slumping markets or lower valuations.
Musk sent a message to Tesla executives Thursday, according to a Reuters report, saying he has a ""super bad feeling"" about the economy and the company should reduce about 10% of its salaried staff, as well as pause global hiring because it has become ""overstaffed in many areas.""
In another email, Musk clarified that this ""would not apply to anyone actually building cars, battery packs or installing solar"" and that ""hourly headcount will increase,"" according to Reuters.
""The fact that he is cutting down on non-production employees is really a statement on how the company is performing in terms of efficiency rather than how the economy is doing,"" Feler said.
Asked at a news conference Friday about Musk's comments, President Biden pointed to continuing investments by Tesla's competitors Ford and Stellantis (formerly Fiat Chrysler) and noted that Ford recently announced the addition of 6,000 union jobs in three states.
""So, you know, lots of luck on his trip to the moon,"" Biden said of Musk.
Still, the often-provocative words of the world's richest man can move markets and affect corporate sentiment, and they don't come in a vacuum.
JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told investors Wednesday to prepare for an economic ""hurricane"" due to interest rate increases and Russia's war in Ukraine.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said the job market has to cool down or the avalanche of new jobs and wage growth might worsen inflation.
The economy added 390,000 jobs in May, more than many analysts expected and in line with monthly growth of about 400,000 -- not the typical scenario for an economy many fear is on the brink of a recession.
But job growth will eventually slow, and cuts will become inevitable as businesses reassess their boom-time hiring plans.
""The jobs market is booming, but it actually has to slow down, because the economy is very close to, if not already at, full employment. If it doesn't slow, the economy will blow past full employment, inflation will become persistent, and the wage growth will exacerbate high inflation,"" Zandi said.
Full employment is defined as when everyone who wants to work has a job.
Employment growth should slow to about 150,000 jobs a month to reach a stable market, Zandi said, and that means ""we are going to hear more CEOs talk about pulling back on hiring plans, announcing a freeze or even layoffs.""
It's not unusual that Musk is one of the first and loudest voices, Zandi added. ""We should expect to hear more on this.""
Companies that have announced layoffs or hiring freezes since the beginning of the year have cited lower profits or higher costs.
In May, online car dealer Carvana said it would lay off 2,500 employees, or about 12% of its staff, and Netflix announced its second round of layoffs, of about 150 people, because of a slump in subscribers and revenue. In another adjustment in the streaming market, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. in April shut down the CNN+ streaming service just weeks after its launch.
Cryptocurrency startups have reacted quickly to market declines.
Coinbase, the exchange platform, announced a hiring freeze, and Gemini Trust, another crypto exchange, said it would lay off 10% of its workforce.
So far this year, 66 tech companies have implemented layoffs, affecting more than 16,000 jobs, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks the sector. Twitter weeks ago announced a hiring freeze and other cost-cutting measures.
At Tesla, layoffs have been nearly as volatile as the company's stock. Musk's first order of business after announcing that he would take over as chief executive in 2008, as the financial crisis gripped the world, was to announce a round of layoffs. Subsequent layoffs were related more to company issues than to the greater economy.
In 2017, after Tesla bought Solar City, Musk announced that he would be slashing 2% of the Tesla and Solar City workforce in what he described as performance-related firings. Many were contract workers. In 2018, while experiencing manufacturing problems with the new Model 3, Musk announced that nearly 10% of the Tesla workforce would be laid off. Late in the year, he acknowledged that the company was ""single-digit weeks"" away from bankruptcy.
Analysts expect Tesla to post weak second-quarter results next month, largely because of a weeks-long pandemic closure at its Shanghai plant.
Economists expect to see an employment slowdown appear first in sectors that are particularly sensitive to high interest rates, such as housing. Several small to medium-size mortgage companies are cutting staff.
The retail sector lost 61,000 jobs in May, underscoring the continued shift in consumption patterns after pandemic restrictions eased and people ventured back out into the world.
""Slowdown in retail corresponds with what we thought consumers would do when pandemic [conditions] would ease: stop buying as much goods and instead start buying experiences, like traveling or going to entertainment venues,"" Feler said.
UCLA Anderson's latest forecast predicts that the unemployment rate will inch up modestly, from 3.6% to 4.2% by mid-2023, as the pace of economic growth is expected to slow down.
""But we also expect the labor force participation to continue increasing, which would mean that the unemployment rate would partly increase as more people look for jobs, and not solely because the numbers of jobs have shrunk,"" Feler said.

245,6-Jun-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk vs. Twitter: Why the Deal Isn't Dead Just Yet,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2673351738/BFD812D457A14912PQ/205?accountid=13946,"Another day, another Elon Musk filing about his deal to buy Twitter. But just because Musk is complaining about bots on the platform, doesn't mean the deal is off.
On Monday, Tesla (ticker: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk disclosed he had sent a letter to Twitter (TWTR) management expressing frustration over spam on the platform.
Twitter believes spam accounts for about 5% of its daily active usage, while Musk believes it is higher and wants to verify Twitter's math. Musk's letter included a threat to walk away from the $44 billion deal if his issues aren't addressed.
Twitter stock fell 1.5% Monday, to close at $39.56, well off the Musk deal price of $54.20 a share.
The S&P 500, meanwhile, was up 0.3% Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was essentially flat.
The Monday filing by Musk's representatives with the Securities and Exchange Commission reads in part: ""Musk delivered a letter to the Issuer reiterating his request for certain data and information necessary to facilitate his evaluation of spam and fake accounts on the Issuer's platform and reserving his rights resulting from the Issuer's refusal to provide such data and information in material breach of the Issuer's obligations under its merger agreement"" with him.
Material breach would give Musk an out, but Twitter doesn't see things that way. The company was planning to move forward with the deal.
""Twitter has and will continue to cooperatively share information with Mr. Musk to consummate the transaction in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. We believe this agreement is in the best interest of all shareholders. We intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms,"" a spokesman for Twitter said Monday in a statement emailed to Barron's.
Later on Monday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said he was launching an investigation looking into Twitter's bot disclosures.
""Texans rely on Twitter's public statements that nearly all its users are real people,"" Paxton said. ""It matters not only for regular Twitter users, but also Texas businesses and advertisers who use Twitter for their livelihoods.""
Twitter declined to comment on the Texas investigation.
The reason spam is important is fairly easy to see. Twitter generates sales by selling ads. If spam represents a bigger share of usage, that affects the platform's ability to generate revenue. Companies won't pay to advertise to bots.
It's unclear whether the bots issue would be enough for Musk to walk away, however. Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, told Barron's via email that the letter from Musk looks like a diligence request.
""Funny, though, Musk waived diligence before he proffered up the draft merger agreement, which he signed,"" Quinn said. ""It is true that the agreement requires continued information sharing throughout the pre-closing period. However, as the Twitter board notes this is solely for the purpose of facilitating closing of the transaction—so information to include in its regulatory filings, etc.""
Though Musk argues that the information about the accounts is required to facilitate the financing of the transaction, Quinn points out that the bank financing is already in place and the equity component is not a closing condition.
""The banks are committed to financing this deal unless there is a breach in the merger agreement,"" Quinn added. ""They don't need any additional information — this deal is not subject to further diligence. An argument by Musk's counsel that the banks now need additional information is a little weird, unless Musk is looking for a pretext to walk away from this deal.""
Musk's deal with Twitter includes a specific performance clause, meaning that if Twitter can prove Musk's financing is in place, it can ask a Delaware judge to order him to complete the transaction. Musk would need to prove revelations about spam accounts had a ""material adverse effect"" on the firm to get out of the deal.
""It looks like they are setting this up to attempt to walk,"" Quinn added. ""At some point, this will get tiresome for the Twitter board and they will sue for a declaratory judgment and an order that Musk close the transaction.""
If the market believed Musk was walking, Twitter stock would likely be much lower. Since Musk's stake in Twitter was disclosed, Twitter shares are flat while the Nasdaq Composite is off about 16%. If Twitter traded with the overall market, Twitter stock might be around $33 a share. The stock is still about $7 away from that level even though shares are still about $14 below Musk's price.
The ratio of $14 to $7 also gives investors and traders a sense of how the overall market feels about the likelihood the deal will go through as initially envisioned. Doubts are high.
Still, it seems the market won't give up completely on the idea that Musk will buy Twitter—for some price. It remains to be seen just what that price will be.

246,6-Jun-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk Threatens to End Twitter Deal Over Lack of Information on Spam Accounts; Twitter says it will continue to share information with Musk; Texas launches investigation of Twitter's tally of fake bot accounts,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2673351744/BFD812D457A14912PQ/447?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk threatened to terminate his deal to buy Twitter Inc. in a letter accusing the company of not complying with his request for data on the number of spam and fake accounts on the social-media platform.
Mr. Musk said Twitter has refused to provide the data necessary for him to facilitate his own evaluation of the number of spam and fake accounts . In April, Twitter accepted Mr. Musk's $44 billion bid to take over the company and go private.
In a letter to Twitter Chief Legal Officer Vijaya Gadde that was disclosed in a regulatory filing Monday, Mr. Musk's lawyer Mike Ringler said Mr. Musk is entitled to the requested data, in part so that he can facilitate the financing of the deal.

Mr. Musk has lined up a group of 19 investors to back his deal. He has also said in filings that he is holding talks with other current Twitter shareholders, including co-founder Jack Dorsey, to roll their shares over into the private company .
""In any event, Mr. Musk is not required to explain his rationale for requesting the data, nor submit to the new conditions the company has attempted to impose on his contractual right to the requested data,"" Mr. Ringler wrote. ""At this point, Mr. Musk believes Twitter is transparently refusing to comply with its obligations under the merger agreement.""
""This is a clear material breach of Twitter's obligations under the merger agreement and Mr. Musk reserves all rights resulting therefrom, including his right not to consummate the transaction and his right to terminate the merger agreement,"" he said.
A Twitter spokesman said the company ""will continue to cooperatively share information with Mr. Musk to consummate the transaction in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement."" He added: ""We intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms.""
Shares of Twitter fell around 1.5% to $39.57 Monday; the all-cash deal is priced at $54.20 a share.
Also on Monday, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched an investigation into Twitter, saying the company may have falsely reported its fake bot accounts in violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Mr. Paxton's office ordered Twitter to produce documents on how it calculates and manages its user data and how that information relates to its advertising businesses. Mr. Paxton's office said Twitter has until June 27 to respond to its demands.
""Texans rely on Twitter's public statements that nearly all its users are real people,"" said Mr. Paxton, a Republican. ""It matters not only for regular Twitter users, but also Texas businesses and advertisers who use Twitter for their livelihoods.""
Mr. Musk last year moved the headquarters for his automotive company, Tesla Inc., to Texas from California. The rocket company he runs, Space Exploration Technologies Corp., has large operations in Texas as well.
Mr. Paxton and Twitter have clashed in the past. Last month a federal appeals court ruled that Texas for now can enforce a law prohibiting the internet's biggest social-media platforms, including Twitter, from suppressing users' content based on the viewpoint of their speech. Mr. Paxton responded to the ruling with a tweet saying he supported the law and that the Fifth Circuit ""made the right call here.""
Mr. Musk's latest letter is his clearest statement that he may try to abandon the deal, potentially spurring what could be a protracted legal battle between the two sides. As part of the deal, both sides agreed to pay each other a $1 billion breakup fee if they cause the deal not to happen for certain reasons. Twitter could also sue to force Mr. Musk to go through with the transaction.
There are only specific scenarios under which Mr. Musk would be able to simply pay the termination fee to walk away from the transaction, including if regulators try to block the deal or the debt financing falls through. Twitter said last week that the window has closed for federal antitrust regulators to block the deal. And Mr. Musk has said he has financing lined up .
For years, Twitter had publicly disclosed its own estimate of how many of its daily active users represent false or spam accounts, putting the percentage at fewer than 5% of its monetizable daily active users. Mr. Musk has pegged the figure at least four times as high at 20% of Twitter's accounts.
Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal on May 16 tweeted that the company had shared information with Mr. Musk about how it estimates spam figures. Mr. Musk responded with a poop emoji .
In his letter Monday, Mr. Ringler confirmed Mr. Musk received a response from Twitter on June 1, but said it didn't satisfy Mr. Musk's requests. ""If Twitter is confident in its publicized spam estimates, Mr. Musk does not understand the company's reluctance to allow Mr. Musk to independently evaluate those estimates,"" the letter said.
As part of the deal, Mr. Musk had waived detailed due diligence that buyers typically perform on targets. In a response to a tweet Monday, Mr. Musk suggested him waiving due diligence didn't apply to any potential misstatements by Twitter.
Legal experts offered different theories on what may be driving Mr. Musk and his legal team.
""This sounds like they're trying to shoehorn a due diligence termination right into an agreement that does not have one,"" said David Hoppe, a mergers and acquisitions, tech and media attorney with Gamma Law in San Francisco.
Mr. Musk would need to argue that something happened since the time he signed the deal that raised new doubts about the estimates that Twitter provided on the amount of spam and fake accounts on its platform, he said.
""I'm sure Musk's legal team wishes there was some change of circumstance that would raise doubts about the legitimacy of those numbers, but nothing's really changed,"" Mr. Hoppe said. ""There's no bombshell.""
By linking the fake-account issue to Mr. Musk's ability to secure financing for the deal, his legal team could be indicating the exit ramp they may try to pursue to extract their client from the transaction, said Ben Means, a professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law. ""Financing obviously is necessary to close the transaction,"" he said.
Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School, said that while Mr. Musk has the right to request information, Twitter may be unable to share it if doing so would breach another person's legal rights or undermine the company's competitive position.
Mr. Musk offered to buy Twitter for $44 billion in April, and the company agreed to the deal the same month. In May, the Tesla chief executive said the deal was ""temporarily on hold"" because of his concerns over the company's accounting of the number of fake accounts on its platform.
Mr. Musk's escalation of the bot issue last month raised suspicions among observers that he is using it as a negotiating tactic to lower the price amid a swooning market, or to exit the takeover deal . Mr. Musk had agreed not to disparage the company or the people who work there under the deal, though has since taken aim at both.
Spam and fake accounts are an industrywide problem and can cause problems for advertisers and bad experiences for users. The accounts can be difficult to detect and are commonly managed by bots, which are computer programs that can automate posts and replies.
Mr. Musk has had unusually extensive interactions with bots. As a habitual tweeter with more than 95 million followers, the Tesla CEO likely has far greater exposure and experience with fake and spam accounts than most on the social-media platform, researchers say. Around 70% of Mr. Musk's followers on Twitter are spam, fake or inactive, versus 41% for all other accounts with between 65 million and 120 million followers, according to an estimate last month from SparkToro LLC, a maker of audience-research software.

247,6-Jun-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",The Other Musk Empire: Rom-Coms: [Business/Financial Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2673264614/BFD812D457A14912PQ/564?accountid=13946,"LOS ANGELES -- Tosca Musk is not particularly interested in space tourism or electric car manufacturing. She is not a rabble-rouser on Twitter who is now buying Twitter. She is not rolling in money, at least not World's Richest Person money.But she is similar to Elon Musk, her eldest sibling, in at least one way: She is determined to turn an easily ridiculed idea into a successful business, prophets of doom be darned.It involves romance novels.Ms. Musk, 47, is the force behind Passionflix, an upstart subscription streaming service dedicated to movie and series adaptations of mass-market romance novels and erotic fan fiction. The online service costs $6 a month and organizes content by a ""barometer of naughtiness."" The categories are ""Oh So Vanilla,"" ""Mildly Titillating,"" ""Passion & Romance,"" ""Toe Curling Yumminess"" and ""NSFW"" (Not Safe for Work). Passionflix has raised nearly $22 million in early funding.""We're looking to raise another five, possibly 10,"" Ms. Musk said. ""You know anybody?""In addition to adaptations -- the vast majority directed by Ms. Musk, who is the company's chief executive -- Passionflix stocks a revolving array of licensed material. Such offerings have included ""Random Encounters,"" a 2013 movie starring the Duchess of Sussex, then known as Meghan Markle, and ""Two Night Stand,"" a 2014 romantic comedy starring Miles Teller. Studio films like ""Sabrina"" and ""The English Patient,"" both from the 1990s, have also been available.Passionflix is sort of a sexy Hallmark Channel. The stories are simple, and the acting is sometimes unrefined. Passionflix dialogue is usually taken directly from the source material, which can be majestically cheesy. ""I've missed making love with you,"" a shirtless hunk whispers huskily in ""Gabriel's Rapture,"" a Passionflix series based on Sylvain Reynard's best-selling novel. ""It was as if one of my limbs was missing.""But please do not call Passionflix a guilty pleasure. ""I hate that description,"" Ms. Musk said in her matter-of-fact way. ""It's simply pleasure."" And get your heads out of the gutter: Naughtiness barometer aside, Passionflix content rarely if ever approaches the soft-core threshold. There are sex scenes, certainly, but the carnality is often on simmer -- a sultry glance here, a thigh graze there. Ms. Musk enforces a rule of no frontal nudity below the waist.""Most of the time people look down at romance -- there is apparently something radical in having female desire as a main theme -- and they don't think that romance is intellectual enough,"" Ms. Musk said. ""I think that is wrong. Romance is about validating emotions. It's about removing shame from sexuality. It's about uplifting stories.""Nothing we do is about being a victim or women in jeopardy or the domestication of women,"" she continued. ""Whether second-chance romance or Cinderella story, at the end of the day it's two people who connect, communicate and compromise.""Passionflix was rolled out in September 2017 and is now available in 150 countries; content is subtitled in nine languages. But the going has been slow. Passionflix has only six employees. The pandemic brought production to a standstill for a time. The number of subscribers is a mystery, with Ms. Musk declining to provide specific data and analysts saying the service is still too tiny to track. (Subscriptions grew 73 percent in 2021 from a year earlier, a Passionflix spokeswoman said.)Moreover, the streaming gold rush is slowing down. At the very least, it is becoming harder to navigate. ""The current marketplace for streaming services is noisy, with major streaming services spending millions to grab consumers' attention, and niche services don't have that kind of budget,"" said Brett Sappington of Interpret, a media consultancy.""Niche services are often at the mercy of aggregators such as smart TVs, streaming boxes or online platforms,"" Mr. Sappington continued. ""They have little negotiating power for revenue sharing, they are often last in line for developer support and they often can't afford to have the prime, front-page spots on websites or app stores.""More than 300 streaming services are available in the United States, according to Parks Associates, a consulting firm. The eight largest accounted for an estimated 88 percent of original content demand from January through March, according to Parrot Analytics. Niche services fought for the balance -- outfits like Revry, for the L.G.B.T.Q. community; Bloody Disgusting, focused on horror fans; kweliTV, dedicated to Black culture; and little Passionflix.But Ms. Musk is not about to give up.""It's just not in my genes,"" she said, with a broad smile. ""Our family motto could be: Keep trying, keep trying, keep trying.""Elon Musk, of course, is the founder of SpaceX, the chief executive of Tesla and the planet's wealthiest person; he struck a $44 billion deal in April to buy Twitter. Ms. Musk's other older brother, Kimbal Musk, is a restaurant entrepreneur and farm-to-table food activist who sits on the boards of SpaceX and Tesla. Their force-of-nature mother, Maye Musk, is a model who recently published the memoir ""A Woman Makes a Plan."" (For a time, Maye ran the Passionflix Instagram account.)Ms. Musk described the typical Passionflix subscriber as ""voraciously engaged"" with the site, and that may be an understatement if Jan Edwards is any indication. Widowed in 2015 and retired from her human resources job in January, Ms. Edwards, 65, lives in Tuckerton, N.J., and has been a Passionflix subscriber since 2018. ""I'm just putting laundry in the dryer -- it's an exciting day over here, let me tell you -- so it's a fine time to talk,"" she said when a reporter phoned.Why does she subscribe? ""Oh, that's easy,"" she said. ""Most of the time, I am overlooked by the rest of the media.""Ms. Edwards said she had become hooked on romantic fiction in 2009 when a friend ""bullied"" her into reading the sadomasochistic love story ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" It was the bookworm equivalent of a gateway drug: Ms. Edwards now reads up to three romance novels a week.""People look down their noses at romance, but it makes me feel good -- and a lot of women agree, although they usually keep it a little quiet,"" she said.It's not just women: Romance Writers of America, a trade organization, estimates that 18 percent of romance readers are male. Thousands of new romance titles appear annually. About 48 million copies were sold in 2021, including e-books, a 10 percent increase from the previous year, according to NPD BookScan.Early financial backers for Passionflix included the television producer Norman Lear and his wife, Lyn, who is also a producer; Jason Calacanis, an internet entrepreneur and angel investor; and Kimbal Musk.And Elon?""It is difficult for me to answer that question,"" Ms. Musk said. ""If I say that he is an investor, then everybody says, 'Oh, she just got her brother to pay for it.' And if I say he didn't invest, then you all say, 'He doesn't support her.""' Elon Musk did not respond to inquiries.First Look Media is the biggest Passionflix investor, although that company's chief executive, Michael Bloom, declined to disclose the size of its stake. (Ms. Musk remains Passionflix's majority owner.) First Look, founded by Pierre Omidyar, the eBay billionaire, is made up of several unconnected entities. There is a nonprofit arm focused on investigative journalism and documentary filmmaking. An entertainment studio, Topic, specializes in prestige films like ""Spencer,"" ""Spotlight"" and ""The Mauritanian."" A relatively new division houses niche streaming services, including Topic.com, which focuses on crime, and Passionflix.""We fully understand that we're walking at the feet of elephants,"" Mr. Bloom said, referring to all-audience streaming services like HBO Max and Netflix. ""But we're not trying to be them. There is an opportunity for specialty services like Passionflix to superserve a particular audience in a way that the big, mainstream retail guys don't do.""Romantic escapism used to be a television staple. It was powered by the miniseries (""The Thorn Birds,"" ""Hollywood Wives"") in the 1980s and the movie-of-the-week in the 1990s (all of those moaning Danielle Steel adaptations). But networks largely abandoned those formats in the 2000s. Cost was one reason; networks also began to favor repeatable crime procedurals and reality shows, including the romance-driven ""Bachelor"" franchise.Over the last decade, only a smattering of romance novel adaptations have made it to television. Even fewer (""Outlander"" on Starz, ""Bridgerton"" on Netflix) have been hits.Passionflix was not conceived as a cynical way to cash in on the streaming boom, Ms. Musk said. Rather, she and two friends, Jina Panebianco and Joany Kane, wanted to make spicy romance television and could not find buyers in Hollywood.""So we had to create a distribution solution,"" Ms. Musk said.Ms. Musk, named after Puccini's opera, studied film at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. After graduating in 1997, she worked for Alliance, a Canadian production company, before moving to Los Angeles, where she directed, wrote and produced a movie, ""Puzzled"" (2001), with backing from Elon. She ultimately began producing and directing TV movies for Hallmark, Lifetime and ION Television.But she was frustrated. ""I kept getting into conflicts with network executives, who were not interested in stories about empowered women embracing their sexuality.""Ms. Musk speaks at a breakneck pace and with an accent that reflects time lived in Canada, the United States and South Africa, where she grew up. She is tall, energetic and frank. At the start of an interview at the Ritz-Carlton, Marina del Rey, near Los Angeles International Airport last month, she announced that her daughter, Isabeau, 9, was in an adjoining room playing a video game and that she had conceived her and her twin brother, Grayson, through an anonymous sperm donor and in vitro fertilization.Ms. Musk moved to Georgia during the pandemic to take advantage of the state's generous tax credits for movie and television production. But she had taken over much of the Ritz-Carlton for an inaugural Passionflix fan convention: PassionCon. Packages for two cost $1,000 and included lodging for two nights, meals, alcohol, a hair and makeup session, panels with Passionflix stars and a pajama party for the third-season premiere of ""Driven,"" about a kindhearted woman who falls for a bad-boy racecar driver. About 200 people attended, Ms. Musk said, some from as far away as Australia and Germany. (Yes, she wore pajamas.)""It was like a dream,"" said Ms. Edwards, who flew in from New Jersey. ""This community really means something to me.""Finding ways to extend Passionflix's business beyond the screen is a new effort for Ms. Musk. She also used PassionCon to introduce Passionflix-branded wine. Bottles cost $35 and carry a slogan:""Toe Curling Yumminess.""PhotographTosca Musk, center right, and her mother, Maye Musk, right, watching a Passionflix show at PassionCon, which was held at the Ritz-Carlton, Marina del Rey, near Los Angeles International Airport last month.

248,7-Jun-22,Barron's (Online),The Twitter Deal Doesn't Hinge on Financing. Elon Musk Can Still Afford It.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2673676923/BFD812D457A14912PQ/262?accountid=13946,"As the Twitter/Elon Musk drama drags on , there are new questions about deal financing .
The stock reactions show the market believes Musk is rich enough to do the deal if he wants to. What's more, the Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock reaction indicates investors aren't really worried about financing details. The market is right.
Tuesday, Reuters reported that some of Musk's financing from external sources was on hold while Tesla CEO and Twitter (TWTR) argue over the amount of active daily usage on the social media platform is represented by spam bots .
Twitter says it's about 5%. Musk wants to verify that number. If spam is a higher percentage than Twitter claims, it might impact the valuation of Twitter. The company sells ads and no one wants to advertise to bots.
Twitter declined to comment. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment made through Tesla.
If Musk were to lose external financing, he could be on the hook for more of the roughly $40 billion in Twitter stock he doesn't already own.
That's a lot, but Musk has the money to cover it. He could sell some of the roughly $150 billion worth of Tesla stock and vested stock options held.
If Musk sold Tesla stock, however, that would be bad news for Tesla investors. No shareholder likes to see large blocks of stock on sale by any company founder—even if it's Elon Musk. Large blocks of stock sold by insiders can shake investor confidence. The transactions can also drive down prices of any stock in the short run.
A potential loss of a portion of any of those external sources isn't roiling the market. Twitter stock ended the day up 1.4% at $40.13 Tuesday, while Tesla stock rose about 0.3%. Neither moved much after the Reuters story appeared, and both stock moves for the day kept pace with the market. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1% and 0.8%, respectively.
The reactions show that Tesla investors don't expect large blocks of Tesla stock to come on sale. They also show that Twitter investors aren't all that worried about deal financing.
If Twitter stock traded in line with the Nasdaq Composite since early April, the stock would be at about $33. The $7 premium to that price shows that the Musk deal is still very much alive in the minds of Twitter investors.
Still, the stock is roughly $14 away from Musk's price of $54.20. If the deal were to close as originally envisioned, investors would make roughly 35%. That's a lot for a merger-arbitrage trade. There is a lot of deal risk embedded in the Twitter price.
Financing isn't the reason for that though. Musk's battle with bots is.
So far, Musk has arranged financing from sale of his own Tesla stock, margin loans with his Tesla stock as collateral, equity financing from partners including Larry Ellison and borrowings from banks.
The drama is far from over. There will be a lot more to digest about financing, legal wrangling, high level negotiations and, of course, exchanges on Twitter.

249,7-Jun-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Musk Warns End to Deal Over Refusal To Give Data: [Business/Financial Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2673491051/BFD812D457A14912PQ/467?accountid=13946,"Mr. Musk's lawyers said Twitter was ""actively resisting"" his requests.In a crisp, six-paragraph letter to Twitter on Monday, lawyers for Elon Musk, the world's richest man, made his displeasure known.Twitter was ""actively resisting and thwarting"" Mr. Musk's rights while he was completing a $44 billion deal to buy the social media service, the lawyers wrote. The company was ""refusing Mr. Musk's data requests"" to disclose the number of fake accounts on its platform, they said. That amounted to a ""clear material breach"" of the deal, the lawyers continued, giving Mr. Musk the right to break off the agreement.The letter, which was delivered to Twitter and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, escalated Mr. Musk's campaign to terminate the blockbuster acquisition. After striking a deal to buy Twitter in April, Mr. Musk, 50, has repeatedly suggested that he may want to scrap the purchase. Monday's letter featured the most direct words yet about his desire to pull out and crystallized his legal argument for doing so.It added another degree of uncertainty to whether Mr. Musk would complete the deal, even though he had waived his rights to do due diligence on Twitter when he bought it. The letter also raised the prospect of a contentious legal battle if one or the other side took the matter to court. If Mr. Musk pursued that route, the terms of the deal give Twitter the right to sue him to force a completion of the acquisition, if his debt financing for the purchase remains intact.The letter also provoked some eye-rolling. Mr. Musk, who leads the electric carmaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX, is famously mercurial and has often winged his wheeling and dealing, making his latest gambit not entirely unexpected.""This is a move Twitter investors have for weeks been steeling themselves for, the moment when Elon Musk's haphazard ruminations in tweets have been distilled into an official letter to regulators,"" wrote Susannah Streeter, a senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""The takeover was always destined to be a bumpy ride.""Twitter said the sale to Mr. Musk remained on course. ""We intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms,"" a spokesman said, adding that the company ""will continue to cooperatively share information with Mr. Musk to consummate the transaction.""Behind the scenes, Twitter has shared information with Mr. Musk for about a month without any breakdown in communication, a person with knowledge of the situation said, requesting anonymity because the discussions were confidential. One of Twitter's concerns in sharing the information is Mr. Musk's prior statements, both publicly and to Twitter, that he was considering starting a rival social media service, two people familiar with the matter said. Typically, such matters are addressed by adding guardrails, like limiting who would have access to such information, and are negotiated before striking any deal.Sean Edgett, Twitter's general counsel, also sent an email to employees on Monday morning reiterating the company's commitment to closing the deal, according to a copy of the memo, which was obtained by The New York Times.Twitter's stock fell 1.5 percent on Monday to close at $39.56, far below the $54.20 price per share that Mr. Musk agreed to pay for the company.Mr. Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Mr. Musk, who has complained about Twitter's fake accounts and bots for weeks, has appeared to get some traction on the issue with others. After Mr. Musk's letter to Twitter became public on Monday, Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, said he was opening an investigation into the company ""for potentially misleading Texans on the number of its 'bot' users,"" his office said in a statement.Twitter declined to comment on Mr. Paxton's investigation.When Mr. Musk agreed to buy Twitter in April, he said he wanted to take the company private, allow more free speech on the platform and improve the service's features. But in the weeks since, the stock market has plunged over fears of inflation, the war in Ukraine and supply chain challenges.The downturn has hit shares of companies such as Tesla, which is Mr. Musk's main source of wealth. The turmoil has also rattled credit markets, potentially making it harder for banks to sell the debt that is typically raised to finance a takeover. Analysts have speculated that these factors have given Mr. Musk buyer's remorse about spending $44 billion on the social media company.In recent weeks, Mr. Musk has threatened to put the Twitter deal ""on hold"" over its number of fake accounts. Last month, he tweeted that ""the deal cannot move forward"" until Twitter shows ""proof"" that these accounts make up less than 5 percent of its users, as the company has repeatedly said. He also made similar remarks at a conference in Miami, indicating that he may be trying to lay the groundwork to rework the deal.In doing so, Mr. Musk appeared to be building a case to argue that Twitter had experienced a ""material adverse change"" that would significantly affect its business, which could allow him to break off the deal. Yet legal experts have questioned the merits of that argument, particularly since Twitter has long disclosed that fake accounts represent about 5 percent of its users.Mr. Musk's letter on Monday, though, represented a new strategy. Rather than simply saying that the billionaire did not believe Twitter's numbers, his lawyers said in the letter that the company was breaching its obligations by not giving Mr. Musk the information that he deemed important to the deal -- in this case, how it accounts for its number of bots.The lawyers wrote that Mr. Musk had ""repeatedly"" requested more information about how Twitter measured spam and fake accounts on its platform and that he had ""made it clear that he does not believe the company's lax testing methodologies are adequate so he must conduct his own analysis.""They said Twitter's cooperation was necessary to secure the debt financing that banks have committed to fund the deal. Morgan Stanley and other lenders have committed $13 billion in debt to help pay for Mr. Musk's takeover. Those commitments are governed by the same legal contracts as the deal.""What he is actually doing is a much more clever attempt to get out of the merger agreement,"" said Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at Tulane Law School. ""If Twitter were really stonewalling information requests, and those information requests were necessary or reasonable for Musk to be able to get his financing -- which is what he's claiming in this letter -- then that would conceivably be a breach that allows Musk to walk away.""Twitter could, in turn, argue it does not have the information that Mr. Musk is demanding, or that it is not necessary for the deal to close, she said.A deal is expected to close by Oct. 24. If it does not close by then, either side can walk away. If the transaction is delayed by regulatory approvals at that time, Mr. Musk and Twitter would have another six months to close it. The deal includes a $1 billion breakup fee for both sides, under certain conditions.In many respects, the agreement otherwise appears on track. Last week, Twitter announced it had received regulatory clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to proceed with its sale.On the financing front, Mr. Musk disclosed in a filing last month that he had raised his personal cash commitment to the deal, canceling a planned loan against shares of Tesla. He also said he was in talks with other Twitter shareholders, including the company's co-founder Jack Dorsey, about rolling their existing shares into the company after it is taken private.For Twitter, completing the deal is existential. The company has faced difficulties delivering consistent financial results and increasing its numbers of users.Parag Agrawal, Twitter's chief executive, last month cut the company's discretionary spending and froze new hiring. Since taking over in November, he has shaken up the company's top ranks and has plans for more changes. He has also asked employees to try to stay the course.""I know we've been going through a period of uncertainty,"" he said at a recent company meeting. ""We are shifting our focus back to our work.""PhotographOn Monday, Elon Musk filed a letter against Twitter with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

250,9-Jun-22,The Washington Post,Twitter to comply with Elon Musk's demands for data,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2674146811/BFD812D457A14912PQ/553?accountid=13946,"After a weeks-long impasse, Twitter's board plans to comply with Elon Musk's demands for internal data by offering access to its full ""firehose,"" the massive stream of data comprising more than 500 million tweets posted each day, according to a person familiar with the company's thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the state of negotiations.
The move aims to end a standoff with the billionaire, who has threatened to pull out of his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter unless the company provides access to data he says is necessary to evaluate the number of fake users on the platform.
The information could be provided as soon as this week, the person said. Currently some two dozen companies pay for access to the trove, which comprises not only a real-time record of tweets but the devices they tweet from, as well as information about the accounts that tweet.
Musk's legal team contends the data stream is essential for understanding the amount of spam and bot activity on its platform, a figure that could influence the company's ad revenue, according to a letter sent to Twitter on Monday.
Musk has said the deal is on hold until he secures the information, adding to speculation he's trying to pull out or renegotiate his purchase for a lower price. When he signed his initial deal to buy the company in April, he waived a right to look deeply at Twitter's finances and internal workings. The purchase agreement requires that Musk go through with the deal unless he can show the company misled him or a major event has changed its value.
Twitter's leaders are skeptical of Musk's ability to use the fire hose to find previously undetected information: The data stream has been available for years to the companies that pay Twitter for the ability to analyze it to find patterns and insights in the daily conversation. They, along with some analysts and Silicon Valley insiders, say that Musk is using the data requests as a pretext to wiggle out of the deal or to negotiate a lower price.
The spam activity is important to his team because if Twitter is underestimating such presence on its service, the company's estimates for how many users could be shown ads would be smaller, affecting revenue.
In the Monday letter addressed to Twitter's general counsel, Vijaya Gadde, Musk's lawyers accused Twitter of refusing to provide information about spam and fake accounts that the billionaire, who is the world's richest man, has been requesting since May 9.
Musk ""must have a complete and accurate understanding of the very core of Twitter's business model - its active user base,"" stated the lawyers from the firm Skadden Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom. ""Twitter's latest offer to simply provide additional details regarding the company's own testing methodologies, whether through written materials or verbal explanations, is tantamount to refusing Mr. Musk's data requests.""
Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Twitter spokesman Scott Bisang referred The Washington Post to the company's Monday statement. ""Twitter has and will continue to cooperatively share information with Mr. Musk to consummate the transaction in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement,"" the statement said. ""We believe this agreement is in the best interest of all shareholders. We intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms.""
Twitter's challenges with bots and fake accounts have been around almost as long as the 16-year-old platform. For years, the company has reported that bots and spam accounts represent less than 5 percent of users on the service, a number the company has derived from extensive audits. (This figure does not include automated accounts permitted by the service.)
But some outside researchers, based on their studies, suggest that percentage is actually much higher - perhaps double or triple the 5 percent figure.
Musk began complaining about the bot issue soon after he agreed to acquire and take the company private for $44 billion in April. He has used his own massive Twitter megaphone to threaten to put the deal ""on hold"" and insisting the deal could not ""move forward"" until Twitter provided further proof of its methods for detecting spam.
Musk has committed more than $33 billion of his own wealth, which largely comes from his ownership of Tesla, to complete the deal. But as the stock market has been roiled by a global downturn, Tesla share values have plummeted, and some analysts have speculated that Musk has buyer's remorse.

251,10-Jun-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Tesla Cancels Online Job Fairs in China; Cancellation of live-stream events follows warning by CEO Elon Musk that company was about to cut jobs,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2674695489/BFD812D457A14912PQ/167?accountid=13946,"HONG KONG—Tesla Inc. has canceled three of its recruitment live-stream events for China scheduled for June, days after Chief Executive Elon Musk warned that the company was about to cut jobs .
The electric-auto maker had advertised online events for June 16, 26 and 30 for positions in different parts of the company: sales and deliveries; research and development; as well as supply-chain jobs such as procurement. But users subscribed to the events that were posted on the company's recruitment channel on the messaging app WeChat were sent mobile notifications late Thursday informing them of the cancellations, which were seen by The Wall Street Journal. No reason was given.
Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a memo sent to staff last week, Mr. Musk said Tesla planned to cut 10% of its salaried workforce, adding that the company had ""become overstaffed in many areas."" He said that the cuts wouldn't apply to workers building cars and battery packs or installing solar panels, but didn't mention whether any cuts would be made at its China operation.
Tesla has become increasingly reliant on its Shanghai Gigafactory, which contributed to more than half of the company's global deliveries in the first quarter of 2022, according to calculations based on data from China Passenger Car Association and Tesla's quarterly results .
Since then, Covid-19 lockdowns in Shanghai have taken a toll on the plant, with production sliding to about 10,000 vehicles in April and car sales for the month totaling just 1,512, down 94% from the year-earlier period. Production recovered in May to about 33,500 units, while car sales reached 32,165, about half of pre-lockdown levels. Around 70% of the vehicles delivered from the plant were exported to other markets, including Europe, Australia and Japan, Chinese car data showed.
Tesla's recruitment webpage on WeChat remained open on Friday, and candidates could still apply for more than 120 openings from the three job categories promoted by the now-canceled events.
Akin to job fairs, the live streams have become the company's main hiring events in China. Past events, which attracted tens of thousands of viewers, included chats with current employees and recruitment managers and virtual tours of company facilities. Hosts would respond to viewers' questions dropped into the broadcasts' chat box.
During Shanghai's Covid lockdown in April, the local government granted Tesla early approval to resume operations under a closed-loop system and to set up a special work team to guarantee production. Tesla said Thursday that production capacity at its Shanghai plant has fully recovered.
Tesla is also building a design center in Beijing and has established a data center in Shanghai.

252,12-Jun-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)","Elon Musk, Mars and the Modern Economy: [Op-Ed]",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2675282079/BFD812D457A14912PQ/638?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk is clearly having a moment; he's trying to back out of his deal to buy Twitter, but he probably can't without paying billions in damages. Perhaps that's why he's thinking about zooming off to Mars?OK, I'm being unfair. (Am I about to receive a poop emoji?) While Musk's decision to talk up a scheme to send a million colonists to Mars may reflect a desire to change the subject, his plan calls for doing so by 2050 -- and he has been talking about that idea for years.Still, the Mars talk caught my attention, largely because of the line about one million people (which I can't help but say in my best Dr. Evil voice).What's your reaction to that number? Does it seem absurdly high? In terms of the logistics of actually getting people to Mars, it probably is. But my original home field in economics was international trade. And if you know anything about trade, or for that matter the realities of industry, you realize that one million is actually an absurdly low number of people -- far too few to support a modern economy.Let's instead treat the SpaceX chief's Mars fantasies as a teachable moment -- a chance to talk about the economics of globalization more generally.Musk's comments immediately called to mind for me a great essay by one of my favorite science fiction writers, Charlie Stross, that posed precisely this question: ""What is the minimum number of people you need in order to maintain (not necessarily to extend) our current level of technological civilization?""Stross's answer was that given the complexity of modern society, you'd need a lot of people. In fact, writing back in 2010 -- when Musk's Tesla was still a struggling company that had only survived the Great Recession thanks to an Obama administration bailout -- he explained how Musk's current plan is thinking far too small: ""Colonizing Mars might well be practical, but only if we can start out by plonking a hundred million people down there."" I agree -- if anything, that's on the low side. To understand why, you need to think about why nations engage in international trade.One reason is that countries have different resources and climates: It's hard to grow pineapples in Norway. But another reason is that in the modern world there are often huge economies of scale in production. These economies of scale make it efficient to supply the entire world market for some goods from only a handful of locations -- sometimes just a single location -- with international trade delivering those goods to customers in other countries.For example, a recent shortage of semiconductor chips -- which seems, finally, to be easing -- has drawn attention to the role of photolithography machines, which use light to etch microscopic circuits on silicon wafers. (Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.) The world market for these it turns out, is dominated by a single firm in the Netherlands, ASML, which has a complete monopoly on the latest generation of machines, which use extreme ultraviolet light to make circuits even more microscopic.So how many factories does ASML have assembling these cutting-edge machines? One. (It has other factories producing subsystems.)These economies of scale mean that no one country can reasonably produce the full range of goods required to operate a modern, high-technology economy. International trade is essential, and more essential the smaller the economy -- which is why Canada is far more dependent on imports than the United States, Belgium far more dependent than Germany, and so on:Now, given access to world markets, even small countries can have full access to the benefits of modern technology; life in Luxembourg is pretty good. But unless we actually invent the Epstein Drive or something, the realities of transportation costs mean that Musk's hypothetical Mars colony would have to be largely self-sufficient, cut off from the rest of the solar system economy. And it wouldn't have enough people to pull that off with anything like a modern standard of living.As I said, I see Musk on Mars as a teachable moment, an unintended thought experiment that helps remind us of the positive aspects of international trade. Yes, there are downsides to globalization, especially to rapid change that can disrupt whole communities. But you really wouldn't want to live in a world without extensive international trade. And you really, really wouldn't want to live on another planet, cut off from the globalization we've created on this one.Quick HitsVaccine supply and international trade.Ideas are getting more expensive.Distance is a major barrier to trade, even on Earth.Just to be fair, Musk is doing a lot to make space travel cheaper.FeedbackIf you're enjoying what you're reading, please consider recommending it to friends.

253,13-Jun-22,Barron's (Online),This Analyst Picks a Bad Day to Upgrade Tesla Stock,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2675535623/BFD812D457A14912PQ/53?accountid=13946,"Tesla shares were falling sharply Monday. Even the stock being raised to Outperform from Sector Perform at RBC Capital Markets wasn't a help.
RBC raised its rating on the stock, highlighting the electric-vehicle giant's ""focus on supply chain and vertical integration."" RBC lowered the price target on shares of Tesla (ticker: TSLA) to $1,100 from $1,175. Tesla shares were falling 5.6% Monday to $657.16 as the broader markets fell sharply on fears over inflation and whether Federal Reserve policy to tame it will cause a recession. Tesla stock, specifically, has declined more than 37.7% this year amid concerns about Covid-19 disruptions in China and CEO Elon Musk's deal to acquire Twitter (TWTR).
Tesla said in a proxy statement on Friday that it wants to split its stock 3-for-1.
RBC said second-quarter margins at Tesla could surprise to the upside with investors primed for lower deliveries. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Tesla second-quarter deliveries of 287,000.
RBC said that mid-to-longer term it was ""increasingly favorable on Tesla's industry positioning.""
With the ""industry in the early innings of electrification,"" the company has benefited from an ""oligopoly-like positioning."" While the automotive market will see more competition during its next phase, and likely lead to share losses for Tesla, the analysts said they weren't overly concerned.
Tesla's ""early focus on vertical integration (not just batteries/raw materials but also motors, semis, software) is likely to pay off especially as industry supply of critical materials may become an issue in 2027/28 and TSLA may be able to control more of their own destiny,"" RBC wrote in a research note. ""Indeed, it appears Elon's Master Plan Part 3 is likely to focus on achieving very large scale to shift the transportation/energy infrastructure. TSLA earnings and cash generation over the coming years, in addition to their ability to use their stock as currency, can help them build out and secure materials giving them a strong competitive advantage.""
Analysts surveyed by FactSet rate Tesla stock at Overweight with an average price target of $968.60.
An internal email from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, saying the company has has had a ""very tough quarter,"" also was putting pressure on the shares. Electrek and Bloomberg reported that Musk told employees the company was taking a hit during the second quarter ""primarily due to supply chain and production challenges in China.""
""So we need to rally hard to recover!"" the reports said Musk wrote in an email over the weekend.
Barron's asked for a copy of the email from Tesla but has yet to receive a reply.

254,14-Jun-22,Barron's (Online),The Fed Is Hiking Into a Bear Market. What Could Go Wrong?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2675924160/BFD812D457A14912PQ/248?accountid=13946,"As Federal Reserve policy makers start their two-day meeting, the S&P 500 has finally taken the plunge into a bear market after teetering on the edge for weeks.
That hasn't stopped speculation that the Fed could surprise with a bigger-than-flagged 0.75-point increase on Wednesday. The fastest inflation in four decades, an aggressive Fed, a stock market rout—these are all things that would normally presage an economic downturn.
Of course, a deep downturn might still be avoided . But it might also pay to remember that no one saw the 2008-09 financial crisis getting as bad as it did, either.
The 2008-9 crisis was surprising because it arose from unexpected places. The Fed threw out a couple of gentle rate increases to take the froth out of the housing market, but then it collapsed. The Fed repeatedly said that subprime problems were contained—until they weren't. And who could have guessed how subprime would spread to European banks, and then European government bonds after that.
So what unknowns could be lurking now?
 Crypto is certainly one candidate. While it may mostly trade in its own universe , the collapse in the value of all crypto assets to below $1 trillion from $3 trillion in November suggests there are a lot of people losing money. The U.S. housing market may also be a part of future problems. It is highly vulnerable to the Fed's moves, and it is undoubtedly starting to lose steam.
But the biggest surprise in the 2008-09 crisis was how fragile the big investment banks were. It would be a worst-case scenario if, despite being better capitalized and with more attentive regulators this time around, commercial banks prove to be part of the problem once again.

Bitcoin Price Slumped, Crypto Companies Plan Layoffs
Bitcoin's price is being crushed by worries about inflation, Fed rate hikes, and recession risks that have rippled across both the stock market and the digital-asset space. The price of the biggest cryptocurrency is now 65% below its high in November, while other smaller digital coins fell even more.
* Bitcoin's price dropped below $24,000, while the value of the cryptocurrency market fell below $1 trillion for the first time since January 2021, according to data site CoinMarketCap. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index fell to 11 out of 100 on Monday, signaling extreme fear among traders.
* Investors believe record-high inflation may induce the Fed to raise its target interest rate higher and faster than expected, a recession risk that tends to hit risky assets such as tech stocks and cryptocurrencies particularly hard.
* But the selling pressure in crypto may reflect more than just an economic outlook. The crypto market itself is under scrutiny. Binance, the largest crypto exchange, paused withdrawals of Bitcoin on Monday after a ""stuck transaction."" Lending platform Celsius on Sunday stopped customer withdrawals.
* Other companies are caught in the downdraft. Crypto exchange BlockFi said it is slashing 20% of its head count, joining others with layoff plans including Crypto.com and Gemini. MicroStrategy, the software services company with a big Bitcoin investment, saw its shares drop 25% on Monday.
What's Next: Bitbank said Bitcoin's price could drop to around its 200-week moving average of about $22,400. Rekt Capital sees an even lower bottom—about 46% to 63% below the 20-month moving average. That would put the cryptocurrency's price between $22,000 and $15,500.

The Bear Market Has Officially Arrived
The S&P 500 is in a bear market, after closing on Monday with a greater than 20% decline from its recent peak. A look back at past bear markets shows there is good news and bad news for investors once the large-cap index has crossed that symbolic threshold.
* Since 1929, the S&P has experienced more than two dozen bear markets. This time, it has been a quicker-than-average descent into bear territory, at 111 trading days since the index's Jan. 3 record high, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
* Only the 1987, 2009, and 2020 bear markets took fewer trading days to achieve a 20% drop among the past 10 bear markets.
* The average bear market peak-to-trough decline for the S&P has been almost 36%, and the index has taken a median of 52 trading days to bottom out. That would mean another 10 weeks or so of continued declines, putting the bottom at roughly late August.
* The 2020 bear market was a peak-to-trough drawdown of 34% but lasted only 33 days, where the 1962 bear market resulted in a 22% drawdown but lasted 240 days.
What's Next: Longer-term returns for the S&P after falling into a bear market are positive. Since 1950, the index has been higher 75% of the time three months after falling into a bear market. It has also been positive 75% of the time a year later, with an average 17% gain.

Elon Musk to Speak With Twitter Staff on Thursday
Elon Musk will be meeting Twitter employees in an all-hands meeting on Thursday, the first time he will do so since agreeing to buy the social-media company for $44 billion in April. Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal announced the meeting in an email to staffers, a spokesman told The Wall Street Journal .
* Since agreeing to buy Twitter, Musk, the chief executive of electric-car maker Tesla, has expressed frustration with the company's management and questioned the accuracy of the number of fake accounts on the platform. Twitter employees, many of whom have been less than happy with Musk's takeover, will be able to submit questions for Musk ahead of the meeting.
* Musk last week filed a 13D stating that he could walk away from the agreement to buy Twitter because of its spam-bot problem. A report from The Washington Post said Twitter would comply with a demand from Musk for internal numbers so he can analyze the prevalence of bot accounts.
* Twitter said it has shared—and will continue to share—information with Musk to close the deal. Twitter said it intends to enforce the merger agreement.
What's Next: Musk won't be caught off guard because the questions are being submitted in advance. They could shed some light on the progress of the deal, any resolution over fake accounts, his wish to reverse the platform's ban on former President Donald Trump, and just what he plans to do with Twitter. The all-hands won't be dull .

Existing Home Sales Now Forecast to Fall This Year
Existing home sales in the U.S. are expected to drop 6.7% by the end of this year, compared with 2021, according to Realtor.com's 2022 Housing Forecast. That is a major revision from its earlier forecast, when it saw a 6.6% rise over last year.
* The increase in borrowing costs since the beginning of the year and looming economic uncertainty means people aren't in the same rush to buy. But even if home sales come in on par with the new projection, 2022 would mark the second-highest tally since 2007, trailing only last year.
* Inventory also is forecast to improve by 15%, up from the 0.3% predicted earlier this year. That could mean a better market for buyers in the fall, according to Realtor.com, which is owned by News Corp, which also owns Dow Jones, the parent of Barron's.
* Home-buyer budgets have remained steady, rising just 0.3% annually in the three months ending April 30, according to a separate report Monday from Redfin. That is the slowest growth rate since June 2020.
* Home prices are likely to remain elevated for the rest of the year. Realtor.com expects the median sales price for existing homes to rise 6.6% in 2022, up from their previous prediction of 2.9% growth.
What's Next: The construction of new homes could also ease the pressure in the housing market. The Commerce Department is expected to release the housing starts data for May on Thursday. The consensus estimates 1.720 million, slightly down from the 1.724 million housing starts in April.

Oracle's Cloud Business Helps Lift Revenue, Brightens Outlook
Oracle's software sales rose in the fourth quarter, welcome news amid a rout in stocks on Monday, and enough to soothe worries about the forecast for the cloud-computing sector. Shares jumped more than 13% in after-hours trading after touching a 52-week low earlier.
* Based in Austin, Texas, Oracle said fiscal fourth-quarter cloud revenue rose 19% from last year. Revenue from infrastructure cloud services rose 36% and helped lift overall revenue by 5%, to $11.8 billion. The number beat expectations.
* The Covid-19 pandemic forced many companies to rapidly digitize their operations, embracing cloud computing. While business conditions are returning to normal, hybrid work continues. Oracle's results demonstrate the growing importance of digital operations, The Wall Street Journal reported.
* Oracle has regulatory approval for its planned $28 billion purchase of electronic-medical-records company Cerner Corp., which is part of an industry that is a big contributor to growth in cloud computing.
* But Oracle still has catching up to do with Amazon.com and Alphabet's Google, which are bigger competitors in the infrastructure cloud business. Oracle CEO Safra Catz said the company's cloud business could grow more than 30% in the 2023 fiscal year.
What's Next: For the August quarter, Catz projected revenue growth of 17% to 19%, including the Cerner acquisition. Cloud revenue for the period is projected to rise as much as 47%, also including the addition of Cerner.

In addition to reiterating his interest in owning the company and his view of its importance in the world, Mr. Musk is likely to clarify recent comments about remote work and touch on aspects of his strategy for Twitter, including the role of advertising and subscriptions.
Twitter shares were up roughly 5% in after-hours trading after The Wall Street Journal's report on Mr. Musk's expected remarks.
Mr. Musk made waves earlier this month when he told employees of Tesla and SpaceX, his space-exploration company, to spend 40 hours a week in the office and suggested that those who don't find a job elsewhere. Should the topic come up, he is expected to tell Twitter employees that the comments primarily applied to certain executives, and that many engineers at his companies already work remotely, which he is fine with.
While Mr. Musk has criticized Twitter for being too reliant on advertising, he is expected to stress that the company should have multiple revenue streams, with advertising and subscriptions among them, the person said.
The plans of the always unpredictable Mr. Musk could still change and the question-and-answer format could prompt him to expand on these and other topics. Other issues employees have been focused on include how Mr. Musk plans to police harassment if he reduces censoring on Twitter as he had said he wants to, as well as potential job cuts.
Mr. Musk has kept Twitter employees and Wall Street on edge as to whether he will follow through on his agreed-upon $44 billion purchase of the social-media platform.
That has caused the spread between the company's stock price and the purchase price of $54.20 a share to balloon, reflecting fear that the deal will fall apart. Twitter stock closed Wednesday at $37.99.
Since agreeing to the deal in April, he has questioned Twitter's estimate of how many of its users are bots and last week threatened to terminate the transaction in a letter accusing the company of not complying with his request for data on spam accounts. Twitter at the time said it was continuing to share information with Mr. Musk and that it planned to enforce the merger agreement.
Earlier, Mr. Musk backed away from a plan to rely on margin loans backed by his Tesla shares and increased the equity he is putting into the deal , a move some saw as a step toward following through with it.
Twitter, which has estimated that no more than 5% of its daily active users are bots, has been in the process of getting him access to expanded data for his team to review. Meanwhile, his team has been working closely with Twitter executives as it develops a business plan.
It couldn't be learned how much time, if any, Mr. Musk will spend on the bot issue Thursday.
Though his appearance at the meeting suggests a commitment to the deal, it is still possible he could seek to renegotiate with Twitter later in the process after his team has analyzed the data. Twitter has the right to sue him to follow through with the current agreement.
Twitter is aiming to schedule a shareholder vote on the deal later this summer and close it soon thereafter, assuming all goes to plan.

256,16-Jun-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk Talks Staffing, Free Speech, Remote Work in Twitter Employee Meeting; Billionaire Tesla chief says costs are 'not a great situation' at social-media company he has agreed to acquire",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2677047699/BFD812D457A14912PQ/193?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk, speaking via a smartphone that he appeared to be holding in front of him, told Twitter Inc. employees that he wants to dramatically increase the platform's users and didn't rule out layoffs as he works to complete his planned $44 billion takeover.
The billionaire serial entrepreneur also outlined his thoughts on free speech and discussed the possibility of alien life, according to employees who participated in the meeting Thursday. His appearance during the wide-ranging, roughly 45-minute virtual gathering marked another twist in what has been an unusual takeover bid .
Mr. Musk's first direct interaction with the social-media company's rank-and-file employees followed weeks in which he publicly criticized Twitter, belittled its top executives and threatened to walk away from the deal. Since agreeing to the acquisition in April , he has said Twitter is too reliant on advertising, questioned its estimated tally of fake and spam accounts and t weeted a poop emoji at Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal.
Mr. Agrawal introduced the Tesla Inc. CEO at the meeting Thursday, according to the people who attended. Mr. Musk was then fed questions by Leslie Berland, Twitter's chief marketing officer, that employees had submitted.
Regarding layoffs, Mr. Musk said anyone who is a significant contributor shouldn't have anything to worry about, according to people who viewed the meeting. ""Right now, costs exceed revenue,"" he said, according to the people. ""That's not a great situation.""
One employee tweeted: ""still not sure if I need to start packing my bags.""
Like other companies, Twitter has taken steps recently to rein in costs , including issuing a hiring freeze, rescinding some job offers and asking employees to curtail business travel and spending. As part of the cuts, the company said it also canceled a companywide trip to Disneyland set for January.
When asked about what he would consider successful for Twitter five to 10 years from now, Mr. Musk said a substantial increase in daily active users to over a billion from around 229 million today. He also said during the meeting that Twitter should be entertaining, like TikTok, and that he admired the Chinese app WeChat, which is used heavily in China for a range of purposes including e-commerce and social networking.
Mr. Musk said that he learns much from what he reads on Twitter and that it is the best way to communicate with a lot of people simultaneously, according to people familiar with the meeting.
Asked about his stance on free speech, Mr. Musk drew a distinction between freedom of speech and freedom of reach, according to attendees. He said that meant people should be allowed to say pretty outrageous things within the law but didn't necessarily deserve to have their tweets amplified and spread virally across Twitter.
On whether he would become CEO of the social-media company, Mr. Musk said he isn't hung up on titles. He went on to discuss his vision to extend the scope, scale and lifespan of civilization as we know it, according to a person who viewed the meeting.
Mr. Musk also briefly touched on the prospects of alien life. ""I've seen no actual evidence for aliens…yet,"" he told employees, people who attended the meeting said.

Ms. Berland raised the subject of remote work, which Mr. Musk has criticized on Twitter. About 1,500 of Twitter's employees work remotely, she said in the meeting. Twitter previously announced a plan to allow employees to work remotely indefinitely if it helped them be more productive.
Mr. Musk responded that the work of building cars at electric-vehicle maker Tesla, where he is chief executive , can't be done remotely.
""If someone can only work remotely, and they're exceptional, it wouldn't make sense to fire them,"" he said, according to the people who viewed the meeting. ""Definitely not in favor of things that are mad."" He added that his bias is strongly for working in person but that managers can decide which of their employees can work remotely, as is the practice at Tesla.
Soon after Mr. Musk's comments, some employees publicly tweeted jokes and memes about how to convey that they were exceptional workers. One employee tweeted: ""adding exceptional contributor to my CV.""
In response to a question about how employees and Mr. Musk can earn each other's trust , Mr. Musk said, ""Trust is as trust does. I tend to be extremely literal in what I say.""
Twitter is aiming to schedule a shareholder vote on the takeover deal later this summer and close it soon thereafter, barring unforeseen developments. Mr. Musk said he would return for another question-and-answer session, attendees said.
Manu Cornet, an engineer at Twitter, poked fun at the all-hands meeting with a cartoon he tweeted Thursday, suggesting that details of the session would be leaked.
Mr. Musk has kept Twitter employees and Wall Street on edge as to whether he will follow through with the transaction. Last week, he threatened to terminate it in a letter accusing the company of not complying with his request for data. Twitter said at the time that it was continuing to share information with Mr. Musk and that it planned to enforce the merger agreement.
Mr. Musk agreed to pay $54.20 a share for Twitter. The company's share price has since fallen amid broader market declines, closing Thursday at $37.36.

257,17-Jun-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Tesla Raises Prices Amid Surging Costs,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2677299058/BFD812D457A14912PQ/64?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc. raised the prices on some of its cars by as much as $6,000, as the electric-car maker grapples with surging costs along its supply chain.
The increase comes as the car industry faces rapidly rising costs on labor, transportation, raw materials and more. It also comes shortly after Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said he plans to cut 10% of its salaried workforce following a hiring spree that saw the company's head count swell 45% in one year alone.
The company last raised prices in March, soon after Mr. Musk warned in a tweet that Tesla and his Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, ""are seeing significant recent inflation pressure in raw materials & logistics.""
The latest price increase applies to certain cars across Tesla's lineup. Its Model 3 long-range car is now going for $57,990, the company's website showed on Thursday, up from $55,990. However, the prices of the Model 3 rear-wheel drive and performance cars didn't change.
Tesla raised the price on its popular Model Y long-range car by $3,000 while the performance version of the car got a $2,000 increase, according to the website. The company lifted the price on its Model S dual motor all-wheel drive by $5,000 and on its Model X dual motor all-wheel drive by $6,000 to $120,990.
Representatives for Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.
Tesla shares fell 8.5% to $639.30 on Thursday amid a broader market downturn.
Mr. Musk in April said that prices take into account monthslong wait lists for its cars as well as expectations that costs will continue to rise.
""It may seem like maybe we're being unreasonable about increasing the prices of our vehicles given that we had record profitability this quarter,"" Mr. Musk said on the company's quarterly earnings call. ""Our prices of vehicles ordered now are really anticipating supplier and logistics cost growth that we're aware of and believe will happen over the next six to 12 months.""
Mr. Musk added at the time that if the company's expected cost increases didn't materialize, Tesla may slightly reduce prices.
Between 10% and 15% of Tesla's cost structure is exposed to swings in raw-materials prices, finance chief Zachary Kirkhorn said in April. The rate of cost increases accelerated in the first quarter and the first few weeks of the second quarter, he said, adding that it will take time to affect Tesla's bottom line because of fixed contracts with suppliers.
Tesla also was hit hard by production shutdowns in China, where governmental Covid-19 restrictions curtailed output at the company's largest plant by volume.
Tesla was hit hard in April. That month, it sold just 1,512 cars made at its Shanghai plant, down 94% from a year earlier.

On Thursday, he finally acted like an owner.In an hourlong question-and-answer session in the morning with Twitter's 8,000 or so employees -- the first time Mr. Musk has spoken with them since he agreed to buy the social media company in April -- the world's richest man opened up about his plans for the service. In an effusive and at times rambling address, he touched on topics as varied as growth, potential layoffs, anonymity, Chinese apps, the existence of alien life-forms and even the cosmic nature of Twitter.""I want Twitter to contribute to a better, long-lasting civilization where we better understand the nature of reality,"" Mr. Musk said in the meeting, which was livestreamed to Twitter employees and which The New York Times listened to.The 50-year-old added that he hoped the service could help humankind ""better understand the nature of the universe, as much as it is possible to understand.""The meeting, which Mr. Musk participated in from his cellphone in what appeared to be a hotel room, suggested that he was set on closing the blockbuster acquisition. His intentions had been in doubt in recent weeks when the billionaire, who also runs the electric carmaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX, repeatedly raised questions about Twitter's fake accounts in an apparent pretext for potentially ending or renegotiating the deal.Since April, the famously mercurial Mr. Musk has tweeted that the purchase was ""on hold"" and accused Twitter of ""actively resisting and thwarting"" his rights. At another point, he had criticized some of the company's executives. He made his inflammatory comments as global markets tumbled and shares of Tesla, which are his main source of wealth, plummeted.The antics from Mr. Musk, who is paying $54.20 a share to buy Twitter, had left investors, the company's employees and others guessing as to what he might do. Twitter's stock is now trading around $37. Yet the company has insisted that the deal remains on track and that it has been sharing information with Mr. Musk, who is on the hook for a breakup fee of $1 billion if he walks away.Mr. Musk did not directly address on Thursday whether he would close the deal with Twitter, but he made it clear to employees that he had grand ambitions.During the conversation, which was moderated by Twitter's chief marketing officer, Leslie Berland, Mr. Musk said he hoped to expand the service to more than one billion users across the world. That would be nearly four times the number of current users. He added that he was hands-on at Tesla and expected to be so at Twitter.Even with such a performance, some cautioned that Mr. Musk might still change his mind about completing the deal for Twitter.""I assume he's operating on two tracks,"" said Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at Tulane Law School. ""Maybe he wants to lower the price or even cancel the deal. If the deal goes through, he wants additional investors.""She added: ""Publicly talking to Twitter employees, trying to assuage their concerns, maybe gives reassurances to potential investors. But I'm not clear whether that's his Plan B or his Plan A.""Twitter declined to comment on the meeting, and Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Musk had been scheduled to speak to Twitter's employees weeks ago, but the session did not take place. Then over the past week, the San Francisco-based company began collecting questions for him from employees on its internal Slack messaging system. The meeting, scheduled to start at 9 a.m. San Francisco time, began a few minutes late, with Parag Agrawal, Twitter's chief executive, thanking Mr. Musk.Then Mr. Musk started answering questions, including about remote work. This month, he sent memos to workers at Tesla and SpaceX saying he expected them to be in the office for 40 hours a week. Twitter's employees have largely worked remotely in the coronavirus pandemic.Mr. Musk told Twitter employees that he was open to their working remotely, given that developing software is different from showing up daily to build cars. But he said a broad lack of in-office participation could contribute to a dwindling ""esprit de corps"" and hoped that people would be willing to go into the office more in the future.Mr. Musk dodged directly answering whether there would be layoffs at Twitter, though his answer was somewhat ominous.""Right now, costs exceed revenue,"" he said. ""That's not a great situation.""At another point, he digressed into a discussion about whether extraterrestrial life was possible, though it was unclear where he netted out. He also brought up the Chinese apps WeChat and TikTok as aspirational, given that WeChat is so embedded in people's daily lives in China and TikTok is ""not boring.""One improvement that Mr. Musk said he wanted to make was adding payments technology to Twitter. Ideally, users would be able to send money back and forth through the service, similar to how products like Venmo or Square Cash operate.Mr. Musk, a longtime power user of Twitter with more than 98 million followers, has long said he believes the company's potential is underutilized. He has added that he hopes to rejuvenate the service outside the eye of the public markets by taking the company private and making significant changes to how Twitter operates.Inside Twitter, some employees have had mixed feelings about Mr. Musk. Some have said they are concerned by his Twitter habits and murky politics.On Thursday, employees at SpaceX circulated a memo saying that they were also concerned about their chief executive's public behavior -- particularly how he acted on Twitter -- and that it reflected poorly on employees.""Elon's behavior in the public sphere is a frequent source of distraction and embarrassment for us,"" read the letter, which was obtained by The Times and reported earlier by The Verge. ""As our C.E.O. and most prominent spokesperson, Elon is seen as the face of SpaceX -- every tweet that Elon sends is a de facto public statement by the company.""Others at Twitter have said they were worried by how Mr. Musk wants to take a laissez-faire approach to policing the platform.On Thursday, he emphasized that he wanted to make Twitter as inclusive a platform as possible, mostly by gaining more users, adding that he would not allow criminal acts to be carried out on the network. He said that he also didn't want to make people use their real names on Twitter and that there was utility in using pseudonyms to express political views on the service.Some Twitter employees, who have pointed to Mr. Musk's reputation as an innovator, said they felt heartened after Thursday's meeting. Mr. Musk was not hostile and seemed to have a vision for the product, despite not being able to enunciate it clearly at times, they said. Others said he had not addressed their questions, with one employee writing in an internal Slack message, which was viewed by The Times, that ""if you took a drink each time he answered a question, you'd be painfully sober at the end of this.""Mr. Musk was noncommittal when asked if he planned to assume the chief executive role at Twitter when he took over the company. He said he wasn't a traditional C.E.O. and pointed to his title at Tesla, which is Technoking. But he also noted that he had many ideas for product updates and how the service should evolve, and that he would make those known to others within the company.""I do expect that they will listen to me in this regard,"" Mr. Musk said.Ryan Mac and Lauren Hirsch contributed reporting.Ryan Mac and Lauren Hirsch contributed reporting.PhotographElon Musk at the Met Gala in May.

261,18-Jun-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition","EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: At Twitter, Elon Musk Needs Loyal Subjects --- The self-appointed 'technoking' needs to be a bit more lovable to realize his vision for the platform",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2677991318/BFD812D457A14912PQ/568?accountid=13946,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Elon Musk has had his intentions to buy Twitter second-guessed by just about everyone in recent weeks, including himself, but Thursday's question-and-answer session with the company's thousands of employees showed his interest in the social-media platform remains strong. How willing thousands of Silicon Valley employees will be to work for the world's richest, least-decisive man is another matter.
Just showing up was a good start for Mr. Musk. That admittedly is a low bar but, for someone who often skirts business decorum, and sometimes the rules, participation was hardly a given. He then described Twitter with what, for him, was an unusual amount of warmth. Whereas some people choose hairstyles to express themselves, he said he enjoys Twitter as a particularly effective megaphone for his ideas.
He has no shortage of those. In response to employees' questions, Mr. Musk described grand plans to morph a fairly niche social-media network into something like a super-app, where a billion people live. Posts should be allowed to be ""pretty outrageous,"" but people must feel comfortable. Revenue will come from ads, but also from payments and subscriptions. And remote-working employees' jobs are very safe -- assuming their work is ""exceptional.""
With specifics glaringly absent, it is certainly worth asking: In a world where remote work is now the norm for white-collar employees, how many people will choose to stake their career on Mr. Musk's subjective esteem? And who will sign up to run this unscripted show?
Mr. Musk also said Thursday that he doesn't care about titles, noting that leading Tesla he is legally ""technoking."" But he also said he expects Twitter's employees will listen to him in terms of how the service will evolve. He clearly wants to call the shots, but will likely call on someone else to execute them.
Mr. Musk has had great success motivating talented people to build the impossible before. His efforts to build rocket ships and electric vehicles both seem to be working out. But today's market has chewed up and spit out the social-media sector, its pitfalls laid bare.
We know bots are an inevitability. We know that advertisers often steer clear of controversial content. And we know adding more engaging TikTok-like video content could further pressure ad monetization in the near-term. No one is safe: Meta Platforms has lost over half its market value this year, and Twitter's shares might have done even worse absent Mr. Musk's iffy bid. With interest rates rising and consumers pinched, some sell-side channel checks suggest online ad spending could be getting worse.
Leadership aside, a job at any social-media company isn't exactly the most inviting opportunity right now. If Mr. Musk really ""loves"" Twitter and wants to see it fly, he might try to be a little more lovable.

Funds As Stocks Fall: [Business/Financial Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2677976463/BFD812D457A14912PQ/591?accountid=13946,"Mr. Musk trashed E.S.G. investing. The S.E.C. is investigating Goldman Sachs's move into the sector. In a falling market, what should investors consider?Any time the stock market falls, investors are likely to rethink nearly everything.The current gut check comes at a point in the evolution of the investing industry when assets in so-called E.S.G. funds have risen 38 percent in the past year, to $2.7 trillion by the end of March, according to Morningstar Direct. Professionals overlay all manner of rules and screens for the investments they pick, using climate, diversity or other data to construct what are now over 6,000 funds worldwide.There is a cost for consciousness: The funds often have high fees that can reduce returns if the investments don't do better than whatever alternatives you reject. And there's a fair bit of confusion about what the term E.S.G. -- short for environmental, social and governance -- means in practice.That can lead to episodes like one last month when Elon Musk called the entire industry a ""scam,"" after S&P Global had the temerity to remove Tesla from an E.S.G. index. S&P did this, it said, in part because of accusations of racial discrimination and other worker mistreatment.Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission is frantically trying to catch up, investigating Goldman Sachs and other big banks and questioning whether some are slapping E.S.G. labels on funds that may not deserve them to make a grab for investor assets.To try to help everyday investors make sense of this, I turned to two professionals who have spent a fair bit of time vetting wannabe E.S.G. investments.The first is Amy Domini, 72, the founder and chair of Domini Impact Investments and a pioneer in the E.S.G. field. The second is Rachel Robasciotti, 43, the founder and chief executive of Adasina Social Capital, which describes itself as an ""investment and financial activism"" firm.Here's what they had to say.RON LIEBER: What's the most accurate definition of E.S.G. today, and how has it changed?AMY DOMINI: Before we start, is that the preferred vocabulary? When I got started it was ""ethical investing,"" but I've lost so many vocabulary fights in my life.I view it as providing a more robust set of material data points from which an investment adviser can make a decision.And I view it as fulfillment of a fiduciary obligation. Assets aren't being managed to the greatest interest of beneficiaries if, in fact, they can't breathe or life is too dangerous at the end of their wealth building. So I see it as a means to an end, and that end is a planet that is livable -- and lives worth living. And I see it as a strategy that explicitly acknowledges that investors have a role to play in providing these outcomes to the world.LIEBER: Rachel, you were familiar with Amy's funds. Did you come to a different conclusion?RACHEL ROBASCIOTTI: We call our work ""social justice investing."" It's the deep integration of four areas: racial, gender, economic and climate justice.LIEBER: Defining justice seems messy these days. On one hand, some investors don't want to invest in weapons manufacturers. On the other, many of them would very much like to put more weapons in the hands of the Ukrainians.ROBASCIOTTI: In the world our investors want to live in, the government is responsible for weapons and defense, and that is not a private activity.LIEBER: Wait, so the government should be producing weapons?DOMINI: Capitalism is great at distributing goods and services broadly and cheaply. Weapons shouldn't be distributed broadly and cheaply.LIEBER: Academics have been talking for years about how so-called active investing is a bad idea -- that it's just too hard to actively select the stocks that will do better than others over the long haul. Doesn't E.S.G. investing violate these principles?ROBASCIOTTI: In order to do a good job of social justice investing, you have to be active on those issues and pay attention when a company's behavior shifts in a way that has a real, material impact on its future.DOMINI: Take Square. They had an arguably strong story for empowering small-business owners, a strong economic justice theme that you could get excited about. As they became more and more of a blockchain company -- to the point where they changed their name, that initial exciting thesis became less and less present.LIEBER: Maybe it's better for curious investors to play with the word ""active"" then, and think of E.S.G. as activist investing. If someone is going to pay the higher-than-average fees -- or at least the higher-than-basic-index-funds fees that firms like yours charge -- it shouldn't just be to move money around silently from one public company to another in a way that may not have much impact. Activists bring pressure. They make noise.DOMINI: We wrote 150 companies in Japan, pointing out that there were two genders and their boards didn't reflect that fact. Japan doesn't have robust shareholder resolution opportunities, but that doesn't mean you can't have some activism.LIEBER: We're in a bear market now. That's often a time when people look to cut costs in their investment portfolios. There's a long history of hand-wringing in the investment industry about the fact that your funds are not cheap. Do you lose in these kinds of market conditions?DOMINI: You have E.S.G. products now at Vanguard, Fidelity, TIAA. They're all doing it because it adds value to the investment decision-making process. That doesn't go away. It's here to stay.ROBASCIOTTI: Historically, women, people of color -- particularly Black people like myself -- weren't allowed into the industry. And now that we're starting to emerge, we're in a situation where we have this enormous price pressure. ""Bring your fees down!""Organizing, mobilizing, educating other investors, putting together data sets -- all of that takes people. You have to be able to invest in them.So I would really question if someone is delivering impact at a really low price point. Many, many, many times with cheap E.S.G., you could hit a data wall and stop. And what we've done is break down the data wall.LIEBER: OK, but do you always trust the data that you get from companies themselves -- the raw numbers or the way they might be selectively counting things?ROBASCIOTTI: We use less of the data that companies provide on their own. Data gathered independently by third parties who are verifying it with public companies' practices is what we really lean on.LIEBER: Elon Musk would beg to differ on the value that E.S.G. adds. How would you try to persuade him in 100 words or less?ROBASCIOTTI (chuckling): Here's what I'd say: The reason that you're confused is because you're a single-issue C.E.O., and that's not the way of the future. The way of the future is people and planet, and a fractured society can't make anything, including electric cars.DOMINI: He went after my industry instead of going after the index that excluded him. The whole industry didn't throw him out.LIEBER: Individual investors face scores of E.S.G. choices. Goldman Sachs and others hope that familiar names will matter. What's the correct framing question that individuals should ask when fund shopping?ROBASCIOTTI: There's actually three. The first is, what are your issues? To us, those are racial, gender, economic and climate, because those are the places where capitalism extracts value unsustainably.Then, how are you measuring it? And the most important question, beyond a shadow of a doubt, is who decides what matters? Go to the people who are most impacted and ask them what is significant, because they're closest to the problem and often farthest from the power. And that's information that investors are not currently getting.LIEBER: What's the most nonobvious example of this third one?ROBASCIOTTI: When we went to the Poor People's Campaign and asked what we should be focusing on, they led us to working with One Fair Wage, which is working to eliminate subminimum wages for tip workers.We created a whole ""Investors for Livable Wages"" campaign and had a collective investor statement that represented over half a trillion dollars of investor money, via the signers, making the case for all public companies ending subminimum wages.LIEBER: This all feels like a lot of work for the investor. Where's my interactive tool that allows just one of the many funds to fall out as my best choice?DOMINI: I feel that a step is better than not taking a step. I'm not totally hung up on who does a better analysis, or an analysis that is consistent with my own analysis. I've looked at so-called strict portfolios that have stocks that I wouldn't put in my portfolio.LIEBER: So this analysis paralysis is my problem -- this isn't the industry's problem?DOMINI: I like women-owned firms, if you want to start with something!ROBASCIOTTI: Just 1.4 percent of all assets at U.S.-based firms are managed by firms owned by women or people of color. So you can narrow your universe right there.The reason why that matters is that doing it the way we've always done it has given us the world we have now. If we're going to have a different world -- if we are going to invest in making more of what we actually want -- we're going to have to choose a different set of people who haven't yet been at the table.PhotographRachel Robasciotti, founder and C.E.O. of Adasina Social Capital.

263,21-Jun-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla Stock Is Jumping. Thank Elon Musk. He Says Competition Doesn't Matter.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2678738957/BFD812D457A14912PQ/70?accountid=13946,"Tesla stock is starting a new week on solid footing, at least in part because of upbeat comments from CEO Elon Musk about demand for electric vehicles.
Most stocks are higher in Tuesday trading, with gains of about 2.6% for and 3.1% for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, respectively. But Tesla stock (ticker: TSLA) is doing much better. It's up 11%, at $720.94 a share. Exactly why any stock is outperforming over a short span of time is difficult to call, but Musk, who spoke Tuesday at a conference in Qatar arranged by Bloomberg, is likely a key factor. Although his interview touched on his deal to purchase Twitter (TWTR) and employment levels at Tesla—watch items for Tesla investors—not much has changed regarding those issues. The bigger deal is likely comments about demand and competition. Musk said the biggest constraints on his company related to raw materials and production. He is more focused on that than on competition from existing auto makers vying for share of the EV market, or from start-ups taking aim at the business.
""As anyone knows who has tried to order a Tesla, the demand for our cars is extremely high and the wait list is long,"" Musk said. In other words, Musk believes he can sell all the EVs Tesla can make for the foreseeable future. That is despite any new competition or price increases due to inflation.
Battery-electric EVs currently account for roughly 10% of global light vehicle sales, according to Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy's figures. Looking at the largest car markets, EVs' share of sales of new vehicles is highest in China and lowest in the U.S.
Electric vehicles are taking a larger share of the market, but investors have worried that inflation might affect demand for new vehicles. Tesla stock dropped 8.5% on June 16 after price increases were posted on Tesla's website. But Musk's comments indicate that car buyers aren't backing away from purchasing new EVs.
That was the best news for Tesla to emerge from the Tuesday conference.
Among all the other issues Musk hit on, Twitter might be the second-most important, but little new information emerged on that front. Musk is still concerned about the share of daily usage on the social-media platform that is generated by bots, an issue he has cited in saying his deal to buy the company is on hold.
The potential purchase has been an overhang for Tesla shareholders, who appear to be concerned that running Twitter could be a distraction for Musk. Tesla stock is down roughly 40% since Musk's stake was disclosed, while the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 24%.
Tesla stock is volatile and might be expected to drop more than the Nasdaq in a bear market, but Tesla also reported surprisingly strong first-quarter results during that time. The company earned more than $3.20 a share during that time, while Wall Street was looking for closer to $2.20.

264,22-Jun-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk's Appeals for Lithium Are No Substitute for Better Price Signals; The energy transition will require a lot more of the key battery metal. A busier marketplace would help show capital where to flow.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2679125316/BFD812D457A14912PQ/337?accountid=13946,"If lithium is the new oil, it needs better answers to widely traded crude benchmarks like Brent and West Texas Intermediate.
Oil-price increases have been modest compared with the rally in the metal that underpins electric-vehicle batteries. Despite a recent pause for breath, spot prices for seaborne supplies of the key lithium compounds, carbonate and hydroxide, have more than quintupled over the past year , according to data from price-reporting agency Fastmarkets. A tidal wave of demand from car makers with big EV plans has washed up against a sluggish supply response.
Yet high lithium prices haven't gotten such widespread attention, and not just because most people still fill up their cars with gasoline. The lithium spot market isn't backed by much trading , and only feeds into the cost of EVs with a lag. To some extent this protects consumers from inflation in the short term, though long waiting lists mean EV manufacturers need to factor in expected raw material costs months down the road. Last week, Tesla raised the sticker price on some of its vehicles by $6,000.
Inefficient lithium pricing comes at a critical cost: It dulls the incentive for producers to bring on extra supplies and muddies the waters for other investors. Elon Musk has filled the void with calls for more lithium mining, but what the metal really needs is proper market infrastructure that does a better job of matching supply with demand.
Much of today's lithium market is locked into deals between suppliers and battery makers at prices that are more or less fixed far below current spot rates. There is a good reason for such contracts: Batteries need to be made to high-quality specifications with trusted batches of inputs. Suppliers such as Albemarle resist the word commodity, preferring ""specialty chemical."" The lithium market is never likely to move in any great volume to an exchange.
This doesn't mean prices can't vary. In fact, more deals are already being indexed to reported spot prices, with premiums or discounts to reflect different product qualities or contracted volumes, says Peter Hannah, senior price-development manager at Fastmarkets. As he points out, these moves are the natural result of market volatility, because buyers and sellers suddenly can't reach agreement on fixing the price.
What hasn't yet evolved is an active futures market, despite efforts by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and others. This may be a matter of time. Car makers, which increasingly negotiate contracts directly with lithium suppliers, will look to hedge out any spot pricing risk they take on. With enough liquidity, a cash-settled futures market would in turn bring much greater pricing clarity to lithium. Investors will help here: A Goldman Sachs note calling the end of lithium's bull run on May 29 triggered a healthy debate, but without proper futures, it isn't easy to trade views.
The financialization of industry sometimes gets a bad press, but this is a case where it could help show capital where to flow. The energy transition will require a lot more lithium mining. High reported spot prices send the right signal, but it isn't as clear or forward-looking as it needs to be.

265,24-Jun-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",How Elon Musk Helped Lift the Ceiling on CEO Pay,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2680480406/BFD812D457A14912PQ/210?accountid=13946,"— PHOTO MOVED IN ADVANCE AND NOT FOR USE - ONLINE OR IN PRINT - BEFORE 12:01 A.M. ET ON SUNDAY, JUNE 26, 2022 — FILE — A Worker at Amazon JFK8 fulfillment center in Staten Island, on March 2, 2021. Amazon’s compensation for its chief executive, Andrew Jassy, was 6,474 times its median pay for employees. (Chang W. Lee/The New York Times)

When Tesla awarded Elon Musk a multibillion-dollar pay package in 2018, the landmark deal helped to vastly increase the potential compensation of the CEOs at many of America’s biggest public companies.
The package was composed entirely of an enormous stock grant tied to the company’s performance. As Tesla has sold enough electric vehicles to become the most valuable automaker on the planet, Musk has so far received shares worth nearly $60 billion — helping to make him the world’s richest person.
Compensation experts say they see the influence of Musk’s deal everywhere.
“There’s a lot of companies out there that saw that award and its structure,” said Brian Johnson, executive director with ISS Corporate Solutions, which advises businesses on executive pay and other practices. “They think it’s a good way to incentivize performance.”
A new survey conducted for The New York Times by Equilar, a compensation consulting firm, shows that many of last year’s highest-paid executives got packages that, like Musk’s, could pay out the sort of sums that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. And even as the gap between what executives and workers earn continued to widen during the pandemic, companies opened the floodgates for what they paid their leaders in 2021.
All of the 10 highest-paid executives had compensation over $100 million, a first. Their average compensation was $330 million, the highest ever. But it’s not just a few executives at the top enjoying the spoils. Underscoring how widespread the pay increases were last year, the median CEO made $32.1 million in 2021, up 27% from $25.3 million in 2020 and far higher than in pre-pandemic years.
Jeff Green, CEO of The Trade Desk, a digital advertising company, reported compensation of $835 million last year, making him the top-paid executive in the Equilar survey, which encompasses 200 companies, all of which have revenue over $1 billion. Green’s pay in 2021 was the third-highest amount that Equilar found in its past five annual surveys, which are based on companies’ pay disclosures; Musk’s deal in 2018, which Tesla valued at $2.3 billion, is still the biggest in those years.
Zig Serafin, CEO of Qualtrics, a software company, was second last year, with compensation of $541 million. It was the fourth-highest sum of the past five years. Peter Kern, CEO of Expedia, the travel company, was third last year, with pay worth $296 million.
Although those compensation totals are taken from the companies’ financial filings, they are often estimates driven by the companies’ attempts to value the stock their CEOs might receive. As a result, the executives may earn less than those totals, especially if the bear market persists and their companies’ stock prices remain depressed, but they could also take home far higher amounts should the stocks recover.
Many of the highest-ranking executives in the survey received pay packages that were far larger than those of the heads of far bigger companies with much larger profits. For example, Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, received his first equity award since 2011 last year and had total compensation of $99 million, putting him just 13th in the survey.
Despite the growth in pay, shareholders, apparently believing that it is being tied to performance, have voted in favor of most packages. Only 3% of “say on pay” votes got less than 50% support from shareholders in the year through June 3, according to an analysis of 1,444 public companies by Willis Towers Watson, a consulting firm that advises companies on executive pay programs and corporate governance matters.
For several years, public companies have had to compare their CEOs’ compensation with that of a typical employee, the result of a regulation passed by Congress that aimed to help investors assess the level of executive pay. Last year, CEOs earned 339 times more than the median pay of employees at their companies, up from 311 times in 2020, according to Equilar. The median employee wage rose 10% last year, to $92,349 from $83,808.
Last year’s executive pay jumped in part because corporate boards, which decide CEO compensation, wanted to reward top officers for navigating their companies through the pandemic.
In addition, the stock market rallied in 2021, and the value of stock grants, which typically constitute the largest share of CEO compensation, was also higher. When stock prices are rising, boards tend to say executives are doing a good job and pay them more.
And in a world mesmerized by Musk and his successes at Tesla, boards are even more likely to view CEOs as indispensable and give them huge pay deals.
“There’s a mindset that the whole thing will fall apart if we don’t have this off-the-charts talented person in that office,” said Sarah Anderson, a program director at the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal think tank that often analyzes CEO pay. “So many people on these corporate boards are benefiting from the system. They’re either executives themselves or they have some other stake in keeping the compensation system the way it is.”
The largest gap between CEO and workers in the survey was at Amazon, where this past spring a union won a battle to organize a warehouse for the first time. Andrew Jassy, who took over from Jeff Bezos as Amazon’s CEO last year, had pay that was 6,474 times that of the company’s median employee. His compensation last year, $213 million, was the eighth highest, according to Equilar. Nearly all of it came from a stock grant.

“The way the SEC rules work, we are required to report that grant as total compensation for 2021 when in reality it will be available to be paid out over the next 10 years, starting in 2023,” Chris Oster, an Amazon spokesperson, said in a statement, referring to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates companies’ disclosures. “As noted in the proxy, this award is intended to represent most of Andy’s compensation for the coming years.

Only one woman, Sue Nabi, CEO of Coty, a cosmetics firm, was among the 20 top-paid executives in the survey, coming in fifth, with $284 million in compensation.
Setting an Example

Musk’s megapackage was criticized when it was announced in 2018. Skeptics said the enormous riches it promised might encourage him to take too many risks to fulfill the plan’s goals. But pay experts say it inspired boards at other companies to concoct similar deals.
The groundbreaking feature of Musk’s compensation plan was not so much the performance targets — those have been around for years — but the colossal amount of stock that covered pay for several years into the future. (Tesla’s board has not awarded Musk any subsequent stock grants.) The stock he has so far gotten for the award is worth just over $60 billion, a treasure chest that helped him finance his bid for Twitter. Musk and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.
Although the value of Musk’s package was huge, its terms were demanding.
Just being employed by Tesla wasn’t enough for Musk to get any of the award. He received no stock just for showing up, a practice that is common in CEO packages.
For him to get the stock, Tesla’s value on the stock market — a function of its stock price — had to keep rising and the company had to hit ambitious targets for sales and operating profits.

This ensured there was a belt-and-suspenders approach to performance measurement. Because Tesla’s business and stock have done exceedingly well in recent years, Musk received nearly all the stock in the deal, according to a recent Tesla regulatory filing, something that seemed highly unlikely at the time it was announced.
The recent plunge in Tesla’s share price means the stock that Musk has received from the 2018 award is worth significantly less than it was just months ago.

Although they have the potential to pay out huge amounts, in certain respects last year’s biggest pay deals were not as demanding as Musk’s.
For Green, of The Trade Desk, to qualify for the options in his package, valued in the proxy statement at $828 million, the company’s stock price must climb well above current levels, but there are no business goals for The Trade Desk to achieve.
Melinda Zurich, a spokesperson for The Trade Desk, said the stock price targets in the company’s award were ambitious and noted that its stock was up several thousand percent since its initial public offering in 2016.
“Jeff has played an integral role in driving that growth and is key to the company’s future growth agenda,” she added.

Serafin, of Qualtrics, doesn’t have to hit any performance targets to qualify for roughly two-thirds of his stock pay last year; he just has to remain in his post to get those shares, which the company valued at $360 million in its proxy statement. And his performance-based shares, valued at $180 million, have business operating targets but no stock price goals. Serafin has already received shares from both awards.
“As a technology company that encounters significant competition for qualified personnel, long-term incentive compensation plays a critical role in our ability to attract, hire, motivate and reward qualified and experienced executive officers,” Qualtrics, which had its initial public offering last year, wrote in its proxy statement. Some companies have awarded executives a large amount of stock when going public as a way to give them “skin in the game.”
Among the highest paid, Nabi, of Coty, appears to have one of the easiest packages to earn. Not only does the $280 million in stock awarded to her last year have no share price or business goals attached, she has already received one-third of the stock outright — and stands to get the rest of the award as soon as August 2023.

A Coty spokesperson noted that the company’s stock had risen since Nabi became CEO in 2020 and added: “Ms. Nabi is one of the beauty industry’s leading founder talents: a hugely respected business leader with an outstanding track record in the sector. In order to attract a true entrepreneur like her, Coty needed to have an enticing equity scheme.”

 No Limit 

Even though there are many well-used ways to construct rich pay packages, companies are still finding novel ways to do so.
Last year, Ariel Emanuel, CEO of Endeavor Group and a powerful Hollywood figure who was the basis for a character in the series “Entourage,” got a performance stock award that places no maximum on the amount of stock it could pay out, according to the company’s proxy statement. If Endeavor stock keeps hitting higher price targets, the award keeps paying out stock, for 10 years. (By contrast, Musk’s blowout package had a capped number of shares.)
“I haven’t seen a plan like this before, with what appears to be no cap on payouts,” said Steven Hall, a compensation consultant.
Endeavor, which went public last year, valued the uncapped award at $196 million. Emanuel got another stock award last year, worth $72 million, that he can receive in full if he stays in his post through next May. Equilar calculated Emanuel’s total pay last year to be $295 million, placing him fourth in the survey.
“Mr. Emanuel’s compensation in Endeavor’s IPO year reflects the value he has created over the last 25 years since founding the company and is tied to its continued performance and the creation of long-term value,” a company spokesperson said in a statement.
If Endeavor’s stock, which has recently plunged, does not recover, Emanuel won’t collect much of his performance stock grant. But Tesla’s stock also fell in the months after Musk received his giant deal. It then soared, clearing the way for Musk, and other CEOs after him, to enjoy sky’s-the-limit pay.

But pay experts say it inspired boards at other companies to concoct similar deals.The groundbreaking feature of Mr. Musk's compensation plan was not so much the performance targets -- those have been around for years -- but the colossal amount of stock that covered pay for several years into the future. (Tesla's board has not awarded Mr. Musk any subsequent stock grants.) The stock that he has so far gotten for the award is worth just over $60 billion, a treasure chest that helped him finance his bid for Twitter. Mr. Musk and Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.Though the value Mr. Musk's package was huge, its terms were demanding.Just being employed by Tesla wasn't enough for Mr. Musk to get any of the award. He received no stock just for showing up, a practice that is common in chief executive packages.For him to get the stock, Tesla's value on the stock market -- a function of its stock price -- had to keep rising and the company had to hit ambitious targets for sales and operating profits. This ensured there was a belt-and-suspenders approach to performance measurement. Because Tesla's business and stock have done exceedingly well in recent years, Mr. Musk received nearly all the stock in the deal, according to a recent Tesla regulatory filing, something that seemed highly unlikely at the time it was announced.The recent plunge in Tesla's share price means the stock that Mr. Musk has received from the 2018 award is worth significantly less than it was just months ago.Though they have the potential to pay out huge amounts, in certain respects last year's biggest pay deals were not as demanding as Mr. Musk's.For Mr. Green of The Trade Desk to qualify for the options in his package, valued in the proxy statement at $828 million, the company's stock price must climb well above current levels, but there are no business goals for The Trade Desk to achieve.Melinda Zurich, a spokeswoman for The Trade Desk, said the stock price targets in the company's award were ambitious and noted that its stock was up several thousand percent since its initial public offering in 2016.""Jeff has played an integral role in driving that growth, and is key to the company's future growth agenda,"" she added.Mr. Serafin of Qualtrics doesn't have to hit any performance targets to qualify for roughly two-thirds of his stock pay last year; he just has to remain in his post to get those shares, which the company valued at $360 million in its proxy statement. And his performance-based shares, valued at $180 million, have business operating targets but no stock price goals. Mr. Serafin has already received shares from both awards.""As a technology company that encounters significant competition for qualified personnel, long-term incentive compensation plays a critical role in our ability to attract, hire, motivate and reward qualified and experienced executive officers,"" Qualtrics, which carried out its initial public offering last year, wrote in its proxy statement. Some companies have awarded executives a large amount of stock when going public as a way to give them ""skin in the game.""Among the highest paid, Ms. Nabi of Coty appears to have one of the easiest packages to earn.Not only does the $280 million in stock awarded to her last year have no share price or business goals attached, she has already received a third of the stock outright -- and stands to get the rest of the award as soon as August next year.A company spokesman noted that Coty's stock had risen since Ms. Nabi became chief executive in 2020 and added, ""Ms. Nabi is one of the beauty industry's leading founder talents: a hugely respected business leader with an outstanding track record in the sector. In order to attract a true entrepreneur like her, Coty needed to have an enticing equity scheme.""No LimitEven though there are many well-used ways to construct rich pay packages, companies are still finding novel ways to do so.Last year, Ariel Emanuel, the chief executive of Endeavor Group and a powerful Hollywood figure who was the basis for a character in the series ""Entourage,"" got a performance stock award that places no maximum on the amount of stock it could pay out, according to the company's proxy statement. If Endeavor stock keeps hitting higher price targets, the award keeps paying out stock, for 10 years. (By contrast, Mr. Musk's blowout package had a capped number of shares.)""I haven't seen a plan like this before, with what appears to be no cap on payouts,"" said Steven Hall, a compensation consultant.Endeavor, which went public last year, valued the uncapped award at $196 million. Mr. Emanuel got another stock award last year, worth $72 million, that he can receive in full if he stays in his post through next May. Equilar calculated Mr. Emanuel's total pay last year to be $295 million, placing him fourth in the survey.""Mr. Emanuel's compensation in Endeavor's I.P.O. year reflects the value he has created over the last 25 years since founding the company and is tied to its continued performance and the creation of long-term value,"" a company spokesman said in a statement.If Endeavor's stock, which has recently plunged, does not recover, Mr. Emanuel won't collect much of his performance stock grant. But Tesla's stock also fell in the months after Mr. Musk received his giant deal. It then soared, clearing the way for Mr. Musk, and other chief executives after him, to enjoy sky's-the-limit pay.PhotographThe goal-driven, stock-filled incentive package for Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, has helped redefine executive compensation.

267,28-Jun-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Turns 51. He Has a Lot More on His Mind Than Birthday Cake.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2681385285/BFD812D457A14912PQ/263?accountid=13946,"It's Elon Musk's birthday. He turns 51 today. A birthday shoutout to a CEO isn't typically a stock market story, but Musk isn't your typical CEO .
There is probably no chief executive more associated with, or more important to their company, than Musk is with Tesla (ticker: TSLA). ""Tesla is Elon Musk,"" Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin told Barron's recently.
When he said it, Irwin was thinking about Musk's bid for Twitter (TWTR) and the risk to Tesla shareholders from Musk splitting his time and taking yet another job. Along with Tesla, Musk leads SpaceX , The Boring Company and Neuralink.
Tesla investors aren't really sure how they feel about Musk adding Twitter to his business quiver. Tesla stock has fallen about 36% since his initial stake in the social media platform was disclosed. The Nasdaq Composite is down about 21% over the same span.
Tesla stock is more volatile than the Nasdaq, so some underperformance might be expected. But that span also includes Tesla's blowout first-quarter numbers. The company reported earnings of $3.22 a share. Wall Street was looking for closer to $2.20 a share. There is some overhang in Tesla stock for Musk's Twitter bid.
Whether or not Tesla investors are happy with the proposed takeover, Musk seems to be the right person to do it. He has 100 million followers on the social media platform and is very active on the site.
Curiously, however, he's been silent for the past week on Twitter. One of his most recent tweets was ""What …. is your favorite cheese?"" It generated almost 100,000 responses.
The lack of tweeting might be a signal to investors that he is a little busier than usual.
Along with working on the Twitter purchase, Musk is dealing with severe supply-chain issues at his car company. A Covid resurgence in China has led to lockdowns, constrained production and a host of parts shortages and delays.
""The past two years have been an absolute nightmare,"" Musk told the Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley Club in a recent interview. He was referring to all the supply-chain interruptions Tesla has dealt with from the Covid-related problems to the lack of semiconductors that has plagued auto production for more than a year.
All that is happening while Tesla tries to ramp up production at two brand new facilities. Tesla recently opened a new manufacturing plant in Germany and another in Texas . The Texas plant is using new structural designs and batteries to reduce cost and extend Tesla's lead over its EV competition.
Startup costs and Covid-related issues have sent second-quarter delivery and earnings estimates for Tesla into a tailspin.
Wall Street projects the company will delivery roughly 250,000 units in the second quarter , down from about 310,000 in the first quarter and down from peak second-quarter estimates of roughly 350,000 units.
As for bottom-line numbers, analysts now project $2 in second quarter per share earnings. That's down from peak estimates of about $2.50 a share. Most of those estimates don't includes any charges for losses on Tesla's Bitcoin holdings .
Bitcoin is trading below the amount Tesla carries from the investment on its books. The company is looking at a $300 million or $400 million write-down, depending on what prices Bitcoin closes the quarter.
Bitcoin's decline is just one more thing for Musk to worry about. Along with Twitter and Tesla he has a lot on his mind. Maybe that's why he is off Twitter. Perhaps he is recharging his batteries and readying himself for a busy second half of 2022.
Tesla stock was up 0.6% in premarket trading at about $739.25 a share. S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.5% and 0.6%, respectively.

268,1-Jul-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Hasn't Tweeted in Days. No One Knows Why.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2682803750/BFD812D457A14912PQ/276?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has been off Twitter for an unusually long while, marking a pause that could make investors nervous given his unusually prominent role as CEO of Tesla. For some, Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk.
The billionaire, who has more than 100 million followers on the social media platform, last tweeted on June 21. The break, nine days and counting, is the longest since October 2017 , according to The Wall Street Journal.
The most recent tweet was about the cost of gasoline . High gasoline prices, of course, help boost sales of electric vehicles , which cost more than traditional cars but are cheaper to operate and maintain. The higher gas goes relative to the price of electricity, the faster EV buyers recapture the extra money spent initially.
There are any number of reasons Musk could be off Twitter (ticker: TWTR), but the entrepreneur's effort to buy the social-media platform is likely the biggest one. Silence could mean that talks are moving ahead.
Twitter recently gave Musk access to more data about the number of bots on the app, responding to concerns he has raised about spam accounts. He believes the number may be higher than Twitter has said, and that the difference could affect the value of the company.
Twitter declined to comment about a reason for Musk's pause.
Musk might also be off Twitter because he has been talking to investors in other forums. Musk appeared at conferences run by Bloomberg and the Financial Times over the past few weeks. He also did an interview with the Tesla Owners of Silicon Valley .
Those events yielded some interesting insights about his Twitter purchase, the production increase at Tesla's new plants in Texas and Germany, EV competition, and supply-chain problems in the industry.
A third, potentially more concerning issue is Musk's battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission over his Twitter habits, and whether he is following a 2018 agreement to have the Tesla board approve all his potentially market-moving tweets. That battle could be heating up, necessitating a tweeting pause.
Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Musk's tweeting.
Tweeting might seem like an odd topic for investors, but following Musk on Twitter is a must-do for any Tesla shareholder or researcher. For starters, Musk drops important tidbits about production, analyst events, vehicles, and other Tesla items on the platform. What is more, Tesla doesn't advertise like a traditional car company: The CEO is the advertising plan.
Investors might not have anything to worry about. In the three months following October 2017, Musk's last tweet-free spell, Tesla stock rose about 10%, about 1 percentage point more than the S&P 500 over the same span.
Barron's certainly doesn't see the Twitter pause as a reason to buy or sell. But with Tesla, and Musk, investors have to consider everything, even issues that don't come up with other companies.
Musk, of course, could just be really busy. Fixing Twitter would be another job for the CEO, who already runs SpaceX, The Boring Company , and Neuralink, as well as Tesla.
Tesla stock was up 1.8% in early trading. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were are up 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively.

269,1-Jul-22,Barron's (Online),"Elon Musk's SpaceX Internet Scores With FCC. It's a Blow to DISH, ViaSat.",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2682682225/BFD812D457A14912PQ/605?accountid=13946,"SpaceX , the rocket company built by billionaire Elon Musk , won regulatory approval to provide motor vehicles, ships, and airplanes with broadband internet from satellites.
The Federal Communications Commission announced the decision Thursday. The decision put an end to petitions by DISH Network (ticker: DISH) and ViaSat (VSAT) to hold up or stop SpaceX's plan.
It's a loss for the pair of satellite operators. But shares of both companies weren't reacting to the news early Friday. DISH stock was flat in premarket trading, while ViaSat shares were up about 1%. S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were both down about 0.4%.
SpaceX, of course, isn't publicly traded. Musk, however, has said Starlink might go public , although he hinted in June any IPO was still years away.
SpaceX's internet service provides high-speed internet through a network of about 2,700 low-orbit satellites at a base price of $110 a month. As of May, it had more than 400,000 subscribers. The company's previously published goal was to reach 40 million subscribers by 2025.
SpaceX didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the goal or the FCC decision.
Starlink isn't targeting only consumer internet subscriptions. Delta Air Lines (DAL) said inApril it was testing Starlink internet service.
Growth like that is key to SpaceX's private market valuation of about $100 billion , which makes it one of the most valuable aerospace franchises on the planet.
 Morgan Stanley 's Adam Jonas built a financial model for SpaceX back in 2020. He didn't project 40-plus million Starlink subscribers until 2029. But he expected Starlink's costs and prices to fall to $25 a month. His revenue estimates by decade's end were close to $12 billion annually. He valued Starlink at some $40 billion, though depending on the scenario, his model ranged from nothing to more than $130 billion.
Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla (ticker: TSLA), has said that Starlink won't be used to add internet to the company's electric cars because the terminals are too big. Starlink is more likely to be used on planes, ships and RVs.

270,3-Jul-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Tesla's Bumpy Quarter Might Be About More Than Lockdowns in China; Second-quarter earnings later this month offer investors a chance to quiz Elon Musk on a bewildering run of news, from job cuts to 'money furnaces'",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2683673162/BFD812D457A14912PQ/157?accountid=13946,"The smooth acceleration shown by Tesla in the past two years faltered in the second quarter . Chief Executive Elon Musk has offered hints that the problems run deeper than lockdowns in Shanghai.
On Saturday, Tesla reported quarterly deliveries of 254,695, down from 310,048 in the first three months of the year. The news came as no great surprise given the pandemic-related shutdowns that affected its Shanghai factory in April and May. The final tally was slightly below consensus expectations of 264,000, according to FactSet.
A bad quarter for sales will be a worse one for earnings, which Tesla reports on July 20. Given China's lower labor costs and established battery supply chain, it is widely assumed that the company's Shanghai operation is more profitable than its other established factory in Fremont, Calif. On top of that, the company is ramping up its new factories in Germany and Texas, which Mr. Musk described as ""money furnaces .""
So it was an ugly quarter all round operationally, but does that matter? Tesla said June was its best month for vehicle production to date, implying that it is accelerating hard out of the problems in April and May. The production ramp-up process in its new plants was always going to be expensive. Analysts have been cutting their forecasts for 2022 deliveries, but the consensus of almost 1.39 million vehicles would still amount to an increase of almost 50% over last year's number.
Tesla isn't the only car maker experiencing problems. General Motors on Friday warned that its second-quarter profit would be lower than expected due to a large batch of unfinished vehicles that it is holding in inventory for want of specific parts.
The other news emanating from Tesla and its boss lately is arguably more concerning than the step down in deliveries. Tesla is cutting white-collar jobs , with Mr. Musk having warned last month that the car maker became ""overstaffed in many areas."" This past week it closed one of its Silicon Valley offices .
These aren't the kind of actions companies undertake due to temporary challenges. Is Tesla overstaffed because the global economy is cooling—Mr. Musk has been vocal on the risk of a recession—or because supply-chain problems have slowed its longer-term plan? Are the cuts related to the CEO's concerns about staff laxity, as revealed in company emails about working from home, or to those money furnaces, which might be burning hotter than hoped? These are questions to dig into during the coming earnings call.
Then there is the issue of Twitter distraction . It still isn't clear whether Mr. Musk will follow through with his $44 billion deal to buy the social-media platform. He continues with due diligence, notably around the issue of fake accounts, but investors are skeptical it will close: Twitter shares trade 29% below the offer price. Any signs that the transaction will go ahead after all could hit Tesla's shares and sharpen questions around succession.
Mr. Musk was very upbeat in Tesla's latest earnings call in April, despite the Shanghai lockdowns in force at the time. Investors need a better understanding of why the mood has soured.

271,7-Jul-22,Barron's (Online),Here's What's Driving Tesla Stock. It's Not Elon Musk's Twins.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2685399435/BFD812D457A14912PQ/126?accountid=13946,"Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla rose 1% in premarket trading Thursday. Here's what's happening.
Chief executive Elon Musk was reported to have had twins with one of his top executives in November. He and Shivon Zilis filed to have their childrens' names altered at a court in Texas, Business Insider reported.
The documents, which showed they asked for the twins to be given Musk's surname and Zilis's surname as part of their middle names, are the first public evidence of the their birth. Musk has nine known children.
Telsa and Neuralink, the company that Musk co-founded where Zilis works, didn't immediately respond to request for comment.
Separately, Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney said that opening up Tesla's (ticker: TSLA) charging stations to non-Tesla EVs could unlock up to $3 billion in annual sales for the company, or 75 cents in per-share earnings, equivalent to about 5% of 2023 estimated earnings.
There are about 136,000 electric charging points in the U.S., of which only about 25,000 are fast ports. Tesla has more than 50% of those. While opening them up to other cars might help other car makers' sales, an open network would also bolster adoption of EVs and lead to higher sales for Tesla as well.
Tesla shares have dropped more than 30% this year, hurt by a broad market selloff as the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates. They have also been affected by Musk's offer to buy social media site Twitter for $44 billion and production problems in China .
The stock rose 3.7% on Thursday to $720.66-a-share.

272,8-Jul-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla Stock Stands to Gain if Musk Succeeds in Ending Twitter Deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2686308541/BFD812D457A14912PQ/50?accountid=13946,"If Elon Musk succeeds in ending his deal to buy Twitter, it could be a positive for Tesla shareholders.
The potential purchase of the social media platform has been an overhang for Tesla (ticker: TSLA) investors for weeks and Tesla stock has been underperforming the market.
Musk said Friday he is terminating the deal to buy the social media company, claiming it had breached the terms of agreement by refusing the provide detailed information about fake accounts on the site.
Twitter said shortly after the news emerged that it will fight to enforce the merger agreement.
If Musk succeeds in ending the deal, investors can expect Tesla stock to get back some of its underperformance.
Since Musk's Twitter (TWTR) stake was disclosed in early April, Tesla stock has dropped about 34%. The Nasdaq Composite is down about 20% over the same span.
Some underperformance, relative to the market, might be expected. Tesla stock is more volatile than the overall market. Investors can expect shares to go up more than the market in good times and down more than the market in bad times.
But the span between Musk's stake disclosure and today includes Tesla's blow out first quarter earnings. Tesla earned about $3.20 a share. Wall Street was projecting closer to $2.20 a share. In a flat market, Tesla stock should have received some benefit for beating earnings estimates by that extent.
The market, of course, wasn't flat. Recession fears rose, hammering many consumer discretionary stocks, including the automotive sector. General Motors (GM) share dropped about 25% between Musk's Twitter stake disclosure and Friday's close. Ford Motor (F) stock dropped about 30%. Parts giant Magna International (MGA) shares dropped 13%.
All together, Future Fund Active ETF (FFND) founder, and Tesla investor, Gary Black believes Tesla stock could see a 5% to 10% bump, relative to the market, if the deal is off.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives put the overhang in dollar terms. He believe there is $100 in Tesla stock for the Twitter distraction.
A $100 rise from today's levels would be about 13% for Tesla shares. Back when Musk's stake was revealed, $100 would have been about 9% of Tesla's stock price.
Some overhang may remain. Even though Musk has cold feet , Twitter seems intent on closing the deal as originally designed.
""We are committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plan to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery,"" Twitter stated in a news release.
Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.
Tesla stock was up 1.4% in after hours trading Friday. Twitter shares were down 7.3% at about $34.14.
At that price, Twitter stock is down 32% since Musk's stake was disclosed compared with a 20% drop for the Nasdaq and 15% drop for the S&P 500.
With those numbers, maybe Twitter investors can take some solace in the idea that there isn't much more downside.

273,8-Jul-22,Republican & Herald,Musk abandons deal to buy Twitter; company says it will sue,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2686960335/BFD812D457A14912PQ/463?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk announced Friday that he will abandon his tumultuous $44 billion offer to buy Twitter after the company failed to provide enough information about the number of fake accounts. Twitter immediately fired back, saying it would sue the Tesla CEO to uphold the deal.
The likely unraveling of the acquisition was just the latest twist in a saga between the world’s richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms, and it may portend a titanic legal battle ahead.
Twitter could have pushed for a $1 billion breakup fee that Musk agreed to pay under these circumstances. Instead, it looks ready to fight to complete the purchase, which the company’s board has approved and CEO Parag Agrawal has insisted he wants to consummate.
In a letter to Twitter’s board, Musk lawyer Mike Ringler complained that his client had for nearly two months sought data to judge the prevalence of “fake or spam” accounts on the social media platform.
“Twitter has failed or refused to provide this information. Sometimes Twitter has ignored Mr. Musk’s requests, sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified, and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving Mr. Musk incomplete or unusable information,” the letter says.
Musk also said the information is fundamental to Twitter’s business and financial performance, and is needed to finish the merger.
In response, the chair of Twitter’s board, Bret Taylor, tweeted that the board is “committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon” with Musk and “plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery.”
The trial court in Delaware frequently handles business disputes among the many corporations, including Twitter, that are incorporated there.
Much of the drama has played out on Twitter, with Musk — who has more than 100 million followers — lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech.
On Friday, shares of Twitter fell 5% to $36.81, well below the $54.20 that Musk had offered to pay. Shares of Tesla, meanwhile, climbed 2.5% to $752.29. After the market closed and Musk’s letter was published, Twitter’s stock continued to decline while Tesla’s climbed higher.
“This is a disaster scenario for Twitter and its board,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors. He predicted a long court fight by Twitter to either restore the deal or get the $1 billion breakup fee.
On Thursday, Twitter sought to shed more light on how it counts spam accounts in a briefing with journalists and company executives. Twitter said it removes 1 million spam accounts each day. The accounts represent well below 5% of its active user base each quarter.
To calculate how many accounts are malicious spam, Twitter said it reviews “thousands of accounts” sampled at random, using both public and private data such as IP addresses, phone numbers, location and account behavior when active, to determine whether an account is real.
Last month, Twitter offered Musk access to its “fire hose” of raw data on hundreds of millions of daily tweets, according to multiple reports at the time, though neither the company nor Musk confirmed that.
One of the chief reasons Musk gave for his interest in taking Twitter private was his belief he could add value to the business by getting rid of its spam bots — the same problem that he’s now citing as a reason to end the deal.
“This whole process has been bizarre,” said Christopher Bouzy, founder of research firm Bot Sentinel, which tracks fake Twitter accounts used for disinformation or harassment. “He knew about this problem. It’s odd that he would use bots and trolls and inauthentic accounts as a way of getting out of the deal.”
On the other hand, Bouzy said, the letter from Musk’s legal team makes some valid critiques of Twitter’s lack of transparency, including its apparent refusal to provide Musk with the same level of internal data it offers some of its big customers.
“It just seems as if they’re hiding something,” said Bouzy, who also believes the number of fake or spam Twitter accounts is higher than what the company has reported.
Musk’s lawyer also alleged that Twitter broke the agreement when it fired two top managers and laid off a third of its talent-acquisition team.
The sale agreement, he wrote, required Twitter to “seek and obtain consent” if it deviated from conducting normal business. Twitter was required to “preserve substantially intact the material components of its current business organization,” the letter said.
Musk’s flirtation with buying Twitter appeared to begin in late March. That’s when Twitter said he contacted members of its board — including co-founder Jack Dorsey — and told them he was buying up shares of the company and was interested in either joining the board, taking Twitter private or starting a competitor.
Then, on April 4, he revealed in a regulatory filing that he had became the company’s largest shareholder after acquiring a 9% stake worth about $3 billion.
At first, Twitter offered Musk a seat on its board. But six days later, Agrawal tweeted that Musk would not be joining the board after all. His bid to buy the company came together quickly after that.
Musk had agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share, inserting a “420” marijuana reference into his offer price. He sold roughly $8.5 billion worth of shares in Tesla to help fund the purchase, then strengthened his commitments of more than $7 billion from a diverse group of investors including Silicon Valley heavy hitters like Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.
Inside Twitter, Musk’s offer was met with confusion and falling morale, especially after Musk publicly criticized one of Twitter’s top lawyers involved in content-moderation decisions.
Groups opposing the takeover from the outset — including those advocating for women, minorities and LGBTQ people — cheered Friday’s news.
“Despite what Musk may claim, this deal isn’t ending because of Twitter bots or spam accounts. This deal is collapsing because of Elon Musk’s own erratic behavior, embrace of extremists and bad business decisions,” said Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters, a left-leaning nonprofit watchdog group that’s been critical of Musk’s Twitter bid.
Musk, he said, “made it clear that he would roll back Twitters’ community standards and safety guidelines, which would turn the platform into a fever swamp of dangerous conspiracy theories, partisan chicanery and white supremacist radicalization.”"
274,9-Jul-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk's Twitter Deal Collided With Market and Economic Tumult; Plunging shares in Tesla and a darkening outlook for social-media companies made the $44 billion deal less appealing over time,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2686981277/BFD812D457A14912PQ/27?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk's timing with Twitter Inc. turned out to be terrible.
When the world's wealthiest man started buying shares in his favorite social-media platform on Jan. 31, tech stocks were only a little more than 10% off their all time highs, and talk of a recession was still largely out over the horizon. By the time Mr. Musk told Twitter on Friday that he wanted out of the $44 billion takeover he had agreed to, the Nasdaq Composite index was deep into bear-market territory, inflation was at levels not seen in decades, and Russia had launched an all-out assault on Ukraine, further roiling markets.
The plummeting price of Tesla Inc. shares had knocked more than $100 billion off Mr. Musk's net worth from its November peak and weakened a key asset he was using to help fund the deal. The outlook for the digital advertising that drives Twitter's business—and for the economy more broadly— had darkened considerably . Less than three weeks after the deal was inked, the social-media company's chief executive, Parag Agrawal, imposed a hiring freeze , citing ""a very challenging macro economic environment.""
In a letter on Friday conveying Mr. Musk's intention to walk away from the deal—which Twitter has vowed to fight in court —his lawyer said the company had failed to provide access to information he needed to verify its estimates about the level of fake and spam accounts on the platform. Mr. Musk, who has initiated a round of layoffs at Tesla amid his own stated concerns about the economy, also is unhappy about Twitter's decision to impose the hiring freeze without consulting him, according to the letter from his lawyer on Friday.
Since Mr. Musk started in mid-May—18 days after signing the deal—suggesting the issue of spam and fake accounts could affect the agreement, analysts, investors and other close observers have speculated that he might be leveraging the issue to renegotiate price or exit the transaction amid the worsening economic outlook. Some Tesla fans and investors were getting nervous about the deal , saying they felt it was distracting Mr. Musk at a difficult time for the car company, and wanted him to walk away.
Mr. Musk largely appeared to shrug off the deteriorating market conditions, saying he wasn't looking to make money off the deal. ""Having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization. I don't care about the economics at all,"" Mr. Musk said in April.

Whatever the case, the financial picture for the proposed deal has worsened steadily since Mr. Musk agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share on April 25. Twitter's share price had fallen 17% through Friday's close, and its market value was some $16 billion below the valuation at which Mr. Musk had agreed to take the company private.
At the start of the year, Mr. Musk was still riding high. Tesla, which underpins most of his personal wealth, reported a record $5.5 billion annual profit in January—more than seven times the prior year, which was its first ever without a net loss. The share price a few months earlier had hit a record high of $1,243.49, putting Mr. Musk's personal net worth at over $330 billion at the time.
By the time Mr. Musk inked the Twitter takeover deal, Tesla shares were down 19% from their November peak. Shares in Twitter had been trading up since Mr. Musk disclosed in early April that he had bought a large stake, but stock prices for rival social-media companies such as Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc. and Snapchat-owner Snap Inc. were falling as companies slowed digital-ad spending in the face of inflation fears, the war in Ukraine and other factors. Twitter had said its board accepted Mr. Musk's offer in part because other parties were unlikely to have the interest or ability to buy the company.
Soon after the deal, as he was lining up financing to pay for it, Mr. Musk sold $8.5 billion of Tesla stock over three days. Afterward, he said he planned to sell no further shares.
The stock sale was unusual, as Mr. Musk for years was reluctant to part with Tesla stock to avoid risking his sway over the company—though he sold a large batch late last year, largely to cover tax liabilities from exercising stock options . He remains the auto maker's largest investor, with a stake of around 16%, but he lacks a dual-class of stock ownership that gives founders over some big tech companies supervoting power.
Instead of selling more, Mr. Musk planned to borrow against his stake. His original financing plan for Twitter included $12.5 billion from margin loans backed by more than $62.5 billion worth of Tesla shares that he owns. But Tesla's share price kept falling —vehicle deliveries in China had plummeted amid pandemic lockdowns there and the company said it was facing strong inflationary pressure. That effectively increased the number of shares Mr. Musk would have to pledge as collateral for those loans.
Mr. Musk reworked the financing plan to reduce that borrowing. About a month after the deal—with Tesla shares now down another 37% from when Mr. Musk agreed to buy Twitter—he filed a revised funding plan that eliminated the margin loans entirely. Instead, Mr. Musk pledged more equity financing—including billions of dollars that he still needed to secure himself or through outside investors.
Tesla shares have regained a bit of ground, but the outlook for both its business and Twitter's has dimmed. In May, Mr. Musk complained that two new car plants the company was ramping up in Texas and Germany were ""gigantic money furnaces."" Early this month, Tesla reported its first sequential drop in quarterly car deliveries in over two years.
Twitter, meanwhile, has gone from its freezing hiring to cutting jobs. On Thursday, it said it laid off 30% of its talent acquisition team.
In the wake of Mr. Musk's regulatory filing, Twitter shares fell 4.81% in after-hours trading Friday to $35.04, or about 20% below where the stock debuted on public markets in November 2013.

 Elon Musk's Twitter Deal Collided With Market and Economic Tumult

275,9-Jul-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla Stock Stands to Gain if Musk Succeeds in Ending Twitter Deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2686397342/BFD812D457A14912PQ/48?accountid=13946,"If Elon Musk succeeds in ending his deal to buy Twitter, it could be a positive for Tesla shareholders.
The potential purchase of the social media platform has been an overhang for Tesla (ticker: TSLA) investors for weeks and Tesla stock has been underperforming the market.
Musk said Friday he is terminating the deal to buy the social media company, claiming it had breached the terms of agreement by refusing the provide detailed information about fake accounts on the site.
Twitter said shortly after the news emerged that it will fight to enforce the merger agreement.
Tesla, Musk and the law firm that drafted Musk's letter to Twitter's chief legal officer—Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom—didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the potential legal action.
If Musk succeeds in ending the deal, investors can expect Tesla stock to get back some of its underperformance.
Since Musk's Twitter (TWTR) stake was disclosed in early April, Tesla stock has dropped about 34%. The Nasdaq Composite is down about 20% over the same span.
Some underperformance, relative to the market, might be expected. Tesla stock is more volatile than the overall market. Investors can expect shares to go up more than the market in good times and down more than the market in bad times.
But the span between Musk's stake disclosure and today includes Tesla's blow out first quarter earnings. Tesla earned about $3.20 a share. Wall Street was projecting closer to $2.20 a share. In a flat market, Tesla stock should have received some benefit for beating earnings estimates by that extent.
The market, of course, wasn't flat. Recession fears rose, hammering many consumer discretionary stocks, including the automotive sector. General Motors (GM) share dropped about 25% between Musk's Twitter stake disclosure and Friday's close. Ford Motor (F) stock dropped about 30%. Parts giant Magna International (MGA) shares dropped 13%.
All together, Future Fund Active ETF (FFND) founder, and Tesla investor, Gary Black believes Tesla stock could see a 5% to 10% bump, relative to the market, if the deal is off.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives put the overhang in dollar terms. He believes there is $100 in Tesla stock for the Twitter distraction.
A $100 rise from today's levels would be about 13% for Tesla shares. Back when Musk's stake was revealed, $100 would have been about 9% of Tesla's stock price.
But even though Musk has cold feet , Twitter seems intent on closing the deal as originally designed.
""We are committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plan to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery,"" Twitter stated in a news release.
Tesla stock was up 1.4% in after hours trading Friday. Twitter shares were down 7.3% at about $34.14.
At that price, Twitter stock is down 32% since Musk's stake was disclosed compared with a 20% drop for the Nasdaq and 15% drop for the S&P 500.
With those numbers, maybe Twitter investors can take some solace in the idea that there doesn't seem to be much more downside.

276,9-Jul-22,Daily Herald,Musk abandons $44 billion deal to buy Twitter; company says it,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2687734307/BFD812D457A14912PQ/464?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk announced Friday that he will abandon his tumultuous $44 billion offer to buy Twitter after the company failed to provide enough information about the number of fake accounts. Twitter immediately fired back, saying it would sue the Tesla CEO to uphold the deal.
The likely unraveling of the acquisition was just the latest twist in a saga between the world’s richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms, and it may portend a titanic legal battle ahead.
Twitter could have pushed for a $1 billion breakup fee that Musk agreed to pay under these circumstances. Instead, it looks ready to fight to complete the purchase, which the company’s board has approved and CEO Parag Agrawal has insisted he wants to consummate.
In a letter to Twitter’s board, Musk lawyer Mike Ringler complained that his client had for nearly two months sought data to judge the prevalence of ""fake or spam"" accounts on the social media platform.
""Twitter has failed or refused to provide this information. Sometimes Twitter has ignored Mr. Musk’s requests, sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified, and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving Mr. Musk incomplete or unusable information,"" the letter said.
Musk also said the information is fundamental to Twitter’s business and financial performance, and is needed to finish the merger.
In response, the chair of Twitter’s board, Bret Taylor, tweeted that the board is ""committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon"" with Musk and ""plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery.""
The trial court in Delaware frequently handles business disputes among the many corporations, including Twitter, that are incorporated there.
Much of the drama has played out on Twitter, with Musk — who has more than 100 million followers — lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech.
On Friday, shares of Twitter fell 5% to $36.81, well below the $54.20 that Musk had offered to pay. Shares of Tesla, meanwhile, climbed 2.5% to $752.29. After the market closed and Musk’s letter was published, Twitter’s stock continued to decline while Tesla climbed higher.
""This is a disaster scenario for Twitter and its board,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors. He predicted a long court fight by Twitter to either restore the deal or get the $1 billion breakup fee.
On Thursday, Twitter sought to shed more light on how it counts spam accounts in a briefing with journalists and company executives. Twitter said it removes 1 million spam accounts each day. The accounts represent well below 5% of its active user base each quarter.
To calculate how many accounts are malicious spam, Twitter said it reviews ""thousands of accounts"" sampled at random, using both public and private data such as IP addresses, phone numbers, location and account behavior when active, to determine whether an account is real.
Last month, Twitter offered Musk access to its ""fire hose"" of raw data on hundreds of millions of daily tweets, according to multiple reports at the time, though neither the company nor Musk confirmed that.
One of the chief reasons Musk gave for his interest in taking Twitter private was his belief he could add value to the business by getting rid of its spam bots — the same problem that he’s now citing as a reason to end the deal.
""This whole process has been bizarre,"" said Christopher Bouzy, founder of research firm Bot Sentinel, which tracks fake Twitter accounts used for disinformation or harassment. ""He knew about this problem. It’s odd that he would use bots and trolls and inauthentic accounts as a way of getting out of the deal.""
On the other hand, Bouzy said, the letter from Musk’s legal team makes some valid critiques of Twitter’s lack of transparency, including its apparent refusal to provide Musk with the same level of internal data it offers some of its big customers.
""It just seems as if they’re hiding something,"" said Bouzy, who also believes the number of fake or spam Twitter accounts is higher than what the company has reported.
Musk’s lawyer also alleged that Twitter broke the agreement when it fired two top managers and laid off a third of its talent-acquisition team.
The sale agreement, he wrote, required Twitter to ""seek and obtain consent"" if it deviated from conducting normal business. Twitter was required to ""preserve substantially intact the material components of its current business organization,"" the letter said.
Musk’s flirtation with buying Twitter appeared to begin in late March. That’s when Twitter said he contacted members of its board — including co-founder Jack Dorsey — and told them he was buying up shares of the company and was interested in either joining the board, taking Twitter private or starting a competitor.
Then, on April 4, he revealed in a regulatory filing that he had became the company’s largest shareholder after acquiring a 9% stake worth about $3 billion.
At first, Twitter offered Musk a seat on its board. But six days later, Agrawal tweeted that Musk would not be joining the board after all. His bid to buy the company came together quickly after that.
Musk had agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share, inserting a ""420"" marijuana reference into his offer price. He sold roughly $8.5 billion worth of shares in Tesla to help fund the purchase, then strengthened his commitments of more than $7 billion from a diverse group of investors including Silicon Valley heavy hitters like Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.
Inside Twitter, Musk’s offer was met with confusion and falling morale, especially after Musk publicly criticized one of Twitter’s top lawyers involved in content-moderation decisions.
Groups opposing the takeover from the outset — including those advocating for women, minorities and LGBTQ people — cheered Friday’s news.
""Despite what Musk may claim, this deal isn’t ending because of Twitter bots or spam accounts. This deal is collapsing because of Elon Musk’s own erratic behavior, embrace of extremists and bad business decisions,"" said Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters, a left-leaning nonprofit watchdog group that’s been critical of Musk’s Twitter bid.
Musk, he said, ""made it clear that he would roll back Twitters’ community standards and safety guidelines, which would turn the platform into a fever swamp of dangerous conspiracy theories, partisan chicanery and white supremacist radicalization.""

277,9-Jul-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Musk Moves To End Deal for Twitter --- Tech entrepreneur cites 'false representations'; social-media platform threatens legal action,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2686660498/BFD812D457A14912PQ/515?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk is seeking to terminate his $44 billion agreement to buy Twitter Inc., saying that the company hasn't provided the necessary data and information he needs to assess the prevalence of fake or spam accounts, according to a regulatory filing Friday.
Twitter ""is in material breach of multiple provisions of that agreement"" and appears to have made ""false and misleading representations"" when entering into the agreement, according to a letter from Mr. Musk's lawyer filed with securities regulators.
The filing caps nearly two months of high-stakes suspense over Mr. Musk's intentions, while setting up a possible legal battle over what comes next for the social-media platform.
Bret Taylor, Twitter's chairman, tweeted Friday afternoon that the board plans to pursue legal action to enforce the deal at the price and terms originally agreed upon.
""We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery,"" Mr. Taylor tweeted. Parag Agrawal, Twitter's chief executive, retweeted the message.
The company has said repeatedly in recent weeks that it was sharing information with Mr. Musk to consummate the deal as laid out in the merger agreement -- and that it intended to close the transaction and enforce the agreement at the agreed price and terms.
There are no guarantees Mr. Musk will be able to walk away from the deal entirely, as Twitter is expected to challenge his legal arguments. Deal clashes often end in negotiated settlements that can include a price cut or one-time payments.
Twitter shares fell about 6% in after-hours trading Friday after the disclosure.
Mr. Musk's lawyer cited concerns over Twitter's estimates about how many of its daily users are fake or spam accounts as an issue Mr. Musk raised as a concern about the deal almost three weeks after he signed it.
Mr. Musk's decision to try to abandon a deal that he initiated -- citing an issue he knew about before agreeing to the transaction -- reinforces the billionaire's reputation for unpredictability. It also leaves major questions about the future of Twitter, which Mr. Musk had pledged to rejuvenate, as the company and other social-media platforms contend with slowing growth in digital advertising and broader economic uncertainty.
At a minimum, Mr. Musk could be on the hook for a $1 billion breakup fee, based on the terms of his April 25 acquisition agreement with Twitter. But the deal gives him only limited leeway to walk away and pay only that amount -- and it isn't clear that his complaints about Twitter's account data qualify. The agreement gives Twitter the right to try to force him to follow through on the acquisition if he seeks to cancel it for other reasons.
The deal's fate has been in question since May 13, when Mr. Musk announced on Twitter that he was temporarily putting it ""on hold"" pending more information about the account issues. Twitter has long said spam accounts represent less than 5% of its monetizable daily active users, the primary user number it discloses. Mr. Musk has suggested the figure could be closer to 20%, but hasn't made clear how he arrived at that calculation.
The May tweet kicked off weeks of back and forth as Mr. Musk repeatedly questioned and poked fun at Twitter -- often on its own platform -- and demanded the company furnish him more data to check its math. Twitter continuously said it was complying with his requests, and eventually provided access to its so-called fire hose of tweets.
Just Thursday, Twitter defended its accounting, saying it typically removes more than one million spam accounts daily while they are being set up or soon after. It also said it relies on closely held user information to identify spam accounts in a process that outsiders without access to that data wouldn't be able to replicate.
While the fake-account sparring played out, tech stocks were continuing to fall. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index has slid 15% since Mr. Musk unveiled his all-cash offer to buy Twitter at $54.20 a share on April 14. Twitter shares had fallen nearly 20% through Friday's close, when they were at $36.81 each.
As he lined up financing for the deal, Mr. Musk sold some shares in Tesla Inc., the electric-vehicle maker he runs. Tesla shares have slumped about 30% since Mr. Musk's interest in Twitter became public.
Outside specialists say fake and spam accounts are an issue for Twitter, as well as other social-media platforms, and the company's calculations about its users are based in part on some of their private information it won't share, even with Mr. Musk.
Still, his decision to threaten the deal over the fake-and-spam accounts issue raised eyebrows from the start. One of Twitter's most active and famous users, with now more than 100 million followers, he had complained about such concerns for years, yet had agreed during deal negotiations to waive due diligence of Twitter's business.
Twitter now faces the prospect of a tricky legal fight to force Mr. Musk to complete the purchase or provide what it sees as fair compensation under a legal protection called ""specific performance."" There are ways for Mr. Musk to fight such an outcome. He could, for instance, prove that something materially changed in Twitter's business, or that he failed to secure the necessary debt financing.
If the deal does collapse, Twitter will be left having to convince shareholders about its own plans to grow in an turbulent economy after being jilted by a devotee of the platform who had consistently talked up its potential. Mr. Musk laid out several changes he planned for Twitter, including cutting back on content moderation and making the platform less reliant on advertising revenue that accounts for about 90% of its sales.
In April, Twitter said it was withdrawing ambitious revenue and user goals. In May, the company said it was pausing hiring and looking to cut costs as it grappled with disruptions in the digital advertising market and amid the war in Ukraine.

278,9-Jul-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Twitter, Elon Musk Set for Unprecedented Legal Battle Over Deal Collapse; Two sides expected to battle over $44 billion deal in Delaware court",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2686981276/BFD812D457A14912PQ/516?accountid=13946,"With Elon Musk attempting to terminate his $44 billion takeover of Twitter Inc. and the company vowing to force him to follow through, the social-media powerhouse and the world's richest person appear headed for a messy courtroom battle .
The company says it plans legal action and is any day expected to file a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery, arguing he is required to close the agreed-upon deal .
Corporate law experts say Twitter appears to be on sounder legal footing than Mr. Musk, who accused the company of breaching their contract. The bigger question, they say, is if Twitter succeeds in court, is it really possible to force the eccentric billionaire— known for eschewing norms even when it gets him in legal trouble —to buy a company he doesn't want to own?
""What are they going to do if there is a judgment and he says, 'Well, I'm still not going to buy it'?"" said Zohar Goshen, professor of transactional law at Columbia Law School. ""They don't really have tools to force him to go through with it. You don't put people in jail because they don't buy something.""
There is little precedent to draw on. Though there have been a handful of examples of buyers being forced to follow through with purchases under the ""specific-performance"" clause that Mr. Musk agreed to , most were small deals. Never has the concept been tested on such a big scale.
Apollo Global Management Inc. in 2008 was ordered by a Delaware judge to make its best efforts to close its $6.5 billion deal to buy chemical maker Huntsman Corp. after the private-equity firm tried to back out. (The two sides ultimately settled , with Apollo agreeing to pay a hefty fee instead.)
Mr. Musk in a Friday filing moved to terminate the deal , with his Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP lawyer Mike Ringler arguing that Twitter breached their contract. Mr. Musk alleged that the company appears to have misrepresented the number of spam accounts on its platform, didn't provide his team with all the information requested, including data to examine the issue, and fired executives and made other changes to its business without permission.
Mr. Musk's team says Twitter's longtime estimate that fewer than 5% of its monetizable daily active users are spam accounts appears inaccurate, and therefore could represent a ""material adverse effect.""
Under this concept, a buyer must show that a company's actual business differs dramatically from what it agreed to buy. It is a high bar that very few buyers who have gotten cold feet have ever successfully invoked.
 PHOTOS: How Elon Musk Made the Fortune He'll Need to Buy Twitter 
Mr. Musk's filing didn't provide evidence to back up his assertion that the estimate was inaccurate or an alternate calculation. Rather, his lawyer wrote, ""Mr. Musk has reason to believe"" that the true number of spam accounts is ""substantially higher"" than Twitter's estimate.
""This isn't even in the ballpark,"" Mr. Goshen said of the argument, adding that the impact on a company's value needs to be so dramatic that its value would be halved, for example. He recalls only one instance of a buyer successfully backing out of a deal on the basis of a material adverse effect: In 2018, healthcare company Fresenius SE got out of a deal to buy Akorn Inc. over alleged data breaches .
Mr. Goshen was similarly skeptical of Mr. Musk's argument that Twitter didn't adequately respond to his team's requests for information relating to the bot estimate. The contract requires Twitter to provide whatever information is reasonably required to complete the deal and doesn't harm its business.
Twitter will likely argue it provided Mr. Musk with more information than is reasonable—giving him access to its fire hose of data in recent weeks—and make the claim that he appears to be requesting the information for the purpose of backing out of the deal, which is far from the intended purpose, Mr. Goshen said. He isn't aware of a case in which a deal fell apart over information access, though such arguments have resulted in price cuts.
Mr. Musk's lawyer also argued that Twitter should have sought his consent before firing two executives and laying off a third of its talent- acquisition team, under a part of the contract that requires the company to not unreasonably interfere with the business before the deal closes. Of all the arguments, this might be the strongest, Mr. Goshen said. Still, it isn't clear that the company's actions were drastic enough to be considered unreasonable.
Most legal clashes over soured deals end in settlements, with both sides agreeing to a price cut or a one-time payment. Mr. Musk agreed to pay a $1 billion reverse termination fee to Twitter if the deal falls apart, though that is only triggered under certain scenarios including if his debt financing falls through or regulators try to block the deal. The agreement caps at $1 billion the amount Twitter could sue for damages for, meaning its only options right now are to sue for specific performance or a maximum of $1 billion, a tiny fraction of what it stands to lose out on should the deal fall apart.
If it sues for specific performance and Mr. Musk agrees to settle, that could involve a payment of more than $1 billion.
Twitter is in a precarious position given that its prospects as a stand-alone company are daunting, due in part to a digital advertising market in upheaval . Twitter shares closed at $36.81 Friday, or 32% below the $54.20-per-share price that Mr. Musk agreed to pay.
Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives on Saturday called Mr. Musk's moves a ""nightmare"" for Twitter as it faces the prospect of a prolonged legal battle . He estimated its stock could sink to $30 if the deal collapses.
For Mr. Musk, there is significant financial incentive to either drop the deal entirely or negotiate a price cut. Technology stocks, including those of Twitter's peers, have sunk since he first made his offer, and the Tesla Inc. chief executive has lost billions in personal wealth as shares in the electric-car company have also dropped. He already sold $8.5 billion worth of Tesla stock , likely to help pay for the deal, and should the deal go through, he would be on the hook to contribute $33.5 billion in equity.

He proclaimed that the company had ""tremendous potential.""Since then, Mr. Musk has changed his tune. He sniped at Twitter's top executives. He unleashed tweets taunting the company's board. He complained that the social media service had too many spam accounts and that he could not get insight into the issue. He tweeted a poop emoji to express his displeasure.And on Friday, Mr. Musk tried to back out of the acquisition altogether.In a regulatory filing prepared by his lawyers, Mr. Musk said he was terminating the Twitter deal because of a continuing disagreement over the number of spam accounts on the platform. He claimed that Twitter had not provided information necessary to calculate the number of those accounts -- which the company has said is lower than 5 percent -- and that it had appeared to make inaccurate statements.""Twitter is in material breach of multiple provisions"" of the deal agreement, Mr. Musk's lawyers said in the filing, and the company ""appears to have made false and misleading representations.""Mr. Musk's move sets up what is likely to be an ugly and protracted legal battle with Twitter. The billionaire signed a legally binding agreement in April to buy the company for $54.20 a share, waiving due diligence to get the deal done quickly. The terms included a $1 billion breakup fee if the agreement fell apart and a clause that gives Twitter the right to sue Mr. Musk and force him to complete or pay for the deal, so long as the debt financing he has corralled remains intact.For Twitter, completing a sale to Mr. Musk is paramount. The company has struggled for years to grow, and its financial performance has been inconsistent. No other potential buyer has emerged as a white knight, its advertising business is under pressure, and it recently slowed hiring and laid off some employees.Since April, Twitter's shares have plummeted more than 20 percent, far below what Mr. Musk offered to buy it. To accept less than the originally negotiated price could expose Twitter to shareholder lawsuits. And in a sign of how the company's investors were banking on the deal, its shares fell 5 percent in after-hours trading on Friday after Mr. Musk revealed his desire to end the deal.Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at Tulane Law School, said Mr. Musk's disagreement with Twitter over spam accounts might not constitute a material breach of the deal, meaning it is a legally tenuous argument.False representations about such accounts are in and of themselves ""not grounds to walk away,"" she said. ""They're only grounds to walk away if they are so overwhelmingly bad that it really just fundamentally jeopardizes the economics of the deal. That's a company material adverse effect.""Yet even if Mr. Musk is forced to go ahead with the deal, sending such a letter may give him a foothold for cutting the price. His action coincides with a widespread slide in the value of tech stocks, including Tesla, the electric carmaker he runs and the main source of his wealth.Buyers have frequently used the threat of walking away to renegotiate a deal. At the height of the pandemic, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton sued to back out of its acquisition of Tiffany & Company. The two parties later shaved about $420 million off the price.Mr. Musk, 51, didn't immediately return requests for comment.In a tweet, Bret Taylor, Twitter's chairman, said the company was intent on seeing the deal through. He alluded to how the matter would end up in court, saying he was ""confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery."" Many corporate cases are heard in Delaware, where Twitter is registered. The company would almost certainly seek an expedited case, given the size of the deal.Citing a material adverse effect to end an acquisition has succeeded only once in Delaware court, Ms. Lipton said. That deal was a $3.7 billion acquisition of Akorn, a pharmaceutical company, by the health care company Fresenius Kabi in 2017, she said.""Twitter has an obligation to fight Musk on this, which they'd need to do because they have a fiduciary duty to do what's best for shareholders and salvage the deal,"" said Adam Sterling, executive director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Business. ""I imagine this will go to court and eventually end in some sort of settlement that allows both sides to save face.""Mr. Musk, who is famously mercurial, has long winged it in the biggest moments with his businesses, which also include the rocket company SpaceX. When he agreed to buy Twitter, he had no plan for the company, people with knowledge of the situation said at the time. The billionaire was simply enamored with the platform, where he has more than 100 million followers and which he used heavily, they said.Owning Twitter is tricky because the platform faces regulatory scrutiny and is embroiled in a debate over free speech online. Its business has also faced difficulties, especially in a competitive market for digital advertising. After Mr. Musk struck the acquisition agreement, Twitter reported 16 percent growth in revenue for the first quarter, below the 20 percent it had predicted.Within weeks, Mr. Musk tweeted that the deal was on hold, saying he wanted more details about the volume of spam and fake accounts. At one point, he said striking a deal for Twitter at a lower price was ""not out of the question."" He also responded to tweets from Parag Agrawal, Twitter's chief executive, who posted details of how the company detects and fights spam, with a poop emoji.Behind the scenes, Twitter continued giving Mr. Musk and his team access to information about its platform, people with knowledge of the situation have said. Last month, the company agreed to allow Mr. Musk direct access to its ""firehose,"" the daily stream of millions of tweets that flow through the company's network. Twitter, which has said roughly 5 percent of its accounts are spam since it went public in 2013, has also said the number is an estimate.Even so, the number of fake accounts remained a concern for Mr. Musk. For years before proposing the acquisition, he complained about spam on Twitter and said the company should do more to authenticate its users. In 2020, he appeared at a Twitter employee event and said the company should do more to prevent spam.Last month, in a six-paragraph letter, Mr. Musk's lawyers demanded more information from Twitter about its methods for counting fake accounts and claimed the firm was ""actively resisting and thwarting"" his rights. The company was ""refusing Mr. Musk's data requests"" to disclose the number of fake accounts on its platform, they said. That amounted to a ""clear material breach"" of the deal, the lawyers continued, saying it gave Mr. Musk the right to break off the agreement.Twitter said on Thursday that it had heightened efforts to detect and block spam after Russia used fake accounts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The company has added new requirements to its sign-up process and said it used human auditors to vet its tally of spam accounts. It also said it removed one million spam accounts each day, and locked millions more per week until the operators of the accounts passed anti-spam tests.Inside Twitter, Sean Edgett, the general counsel, sent a memo on Friday afternoon to employees effectively telling them to keep quiet about the latest twist in the deal with Mr. Musk.""Given this is an ongoing legal matter, you should refrain from Tweeting, Slacking or sharing any commentary about the Merger Agreement,"" he wrote in the memo, which was obtained by The New York Times.Ryan Mac and Mike Isaac contributed reporting.Ryan Mac and Mike Isaac contributed reporting.PhotographElon Musk in 2020, left, and Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco, above.

280,10-Jul-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Twitter Is the Biggest Musk Loser; The social-media platform needs a reboot without the Tesla CEO.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2687508063/BFD812D457A14912PQ/113?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk's decision Friday to call off his purchase of Twitter is a loss for the social-media site as well as for political free speech. The only winners will be progressives who support the site's censorship of views that don't conform to theirs on politics, climate and many other subjects.
Critics say Mr. Musk was never serious about buying Twitter, but he sure went a long way to show he was. He now faces a $1 billion breakup fee, as well as extensive litigation with the company. Mr. Musk offered $54.20 a share, but the stock had fallen to $36.81 before Friday's announcement. It fell to $35.04 in after-hours trading.
Mr. Musk's takeover financing was heavily leveraged and became more precarious as interest rates rose. He initially offered Tesla shares as collateral, but then sought to replace margin loans by bringing in other investors as Tesla shares fell along with the market. He has accused Twitter of undercounting spam accounts and a lack of transparency.
The site's user growth is slowing, and it has lost $1.3 billion over the past two years even as tech-company profits have boomed. In February Twitter borrowed $1 billion in private markets. But debt is becoming more expensive, and other mooted suitors with the means to buy Twitter could encounter regulatory obstacles.
Mr. Musk may be hoping to negotiate a lower purchase price, but if he does walk away it will be a loss for political discourse. Tweets by conservatives that present even purely factual information about subjects like Covid treatments and climate are often labelled misinformation. Accounts are suspended without explanation, and appeals go unanswered. Nobody knows who the wizards are behind the curtains making these decisions, and Mr. Musk says he'd allow more open debate.
A Musk purchase would be a free-market solution to the progressive dominance of tech platforms. Republicans are promising to target tech-company censorship if they win control of Congress in November, and Twitter will be one of the first in line. This could also frighten investors and potential buyers.
Twitter can help itself by ending its one-sided political censorship, but its woke staff and corporate culture might make that impossible. The company might find it needed Mr. Musk more than he needed Twitter.

281,10-Jul-22,Wyoming Tribune - Eagle,Musk abandons deal to buy Twitter; company says it will sue,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2687242724/BFD812D457A14912PQ/492?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk announced Friday that he will abandon his $44 billion offer to buy Twitter after the company failed to provide enough information about the number of fake accounts. Twitter immediately fired back, saying it would sue the Tesla CEO to uphold the deal.
This is the latest twist in a saga between the world’s richest man and one of the most influential social media platforms, and it may portend a titanic legal battle.
Twitter could have pushed for a $1 billion breakup fee that Musk agreed to pay under these circumstances. Instead, it looks ready to fight to complete the purchase, which the company’s board has approved and CEO Parag Agrawal has insisted he wants to consummate.
In a letter to Twitter's board, Musk lawyer Mike Ringler complained that his client had for nearly two months sought data to judge the prevalence of “fake or spam” accounts on the social media platform.
“Twitter has failed or refused to provide this information. Sometimes Twitter has ignored Mr. Musk’s requests, sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified, and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving Mr. Musk incomplete or unusable information,” the letter said.
In response, the chair of Twitter's board, Bret Taylor, tweeted that the board is “committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon"" with Musk and ""plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery.”
The trial court in Delaware frequently handles business disputes among the many corporations, including Twitter, that are incorporated there.
Former President Donald Trump weighed in on his own social platform, Truth Social: “THE TWITTER DEAL IS DEAD, LONG LIVE THE ‘TRUTH’”. Musk said in May that he would allow Trump, who was banned from Twitter following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, back onto the platform.
Much of the drama surrounding the deal has played out on Twitter, with Musk — who has more than 100 million followers — lamenting that the company was failing to live up to its potential as a platform for free speech.
On Friday, shares of Twitter fell 5% to $36.81, well below the $54.20 that Musk agreed to pay. Shares of Tesla, meanwhile, climbed 2.5% to $752.29. After the market closed and Musk's letter was published, Twitter's stock continued to decline while Tesla climbed higher.
Analysts react
""This is a disaster scenario for Twitter and its board,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors. He predicted a long court fight by Twitter to either restore the deal or get the $1 billion breakup fee.
One of the chief reasons Musk gave for his interest in taking Twitter private was his belief he could add value to the business by getting rid of its spam bots — the same problem that he’s now citing as a reason to end the deal.
“This whole process has been bizarre,” said Christopher Bouzy, founder of research firm Bot Sentinel, which tracks fake Twitter accounts used for disinformation or harassment. “He knew about this problem. It’s odd that he would use bots and trolls and inauthentic accounts as a way of getting out of the deal.”
On the other hand, Bouzy said, the letter from Musk’s legal team makes some valid critiques of Twitter’s lack of transparency, including its apparent refusal to provide Musk with the same level of internal data it offers some of its big customers.
“It just seems as if they’re hiding something,” said Bouzy, who also believes the number of fake or spam Twitter accounts is higher than what the company has reported.
Musk's lawyer also alleged that Twitter broke the agreement when it fired two top managers and laid off a third of its talent-acquisition team.
The sale agreement, he wrote, required Twitter to “seek and obtain consent” if it deviated from conducting normal business. Twitter was required to “preserve substantially intact the material components of its current business organization,” the letter said.
Groups opposing the takeover from the outset cheered Friday's news.
“Despite what Musk may claim, this deal isn’t ending because of Twitter bots or spam accounts. This deal is collapsing because of Elon Musk’s own erratic behavior, embrace of extremists and bad business decisions,” said Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters, a left-leaning nonprofit watchdog group that’s been critical of Musk’s Twitter bid.
Musk, he said, “made it clear that he would roll back Twitters’ community standards and safety guidelines, which would turn the platform into a fever swamp of dangerous conspiracy theories, partisan chicanery and white supremacist radicalization.”"
282,10-Jul-22,The Washington Post,"As Musk backs away, Twitter faces 'worst case scenario'",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2687142287/BFD812D457A14912PQ/538?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk's attempt to terminate his Twitter acquisition will likely force the social network into a protracted legal battle and send its stock price diving - thrusting a new level of chaos upon the firm after months of public disputes have battered its reputation and employee morale.
In short? ""This was worst case scenario for Twitter, and now it's happened,"" said Dan Ives, the managing director and senior equity research analyst covering the tech sector at Wedbush Securities.
Ives warned that Musk's bid to walk away may make the company appear to be ""damaged goods"" in the eyes of other investors or potential acquirers. Twitter shares were down nearly 6 percent in after-hours trading on Friday. Wedbush Securities projects the stock could sink to between $25 and $30 when the market reopens Monday, down more than 30 percent from where it closed Friday afternoon before Musk's filing.
In a Friday evening news release, Twitter's board threatened to ""pursue legal action"" to enforce the terms of the $44 billion deal Musk struck in April to buy the social network and take it private. He is required to go through with the purchase, barring a major change to the business, which legal experts say is difficult to prove.
Twitter's board said that it was confident the company would prevail in court, but analysts warn - and employees fear - that Musk's letter sets the stage for a turbulent period, which could carry new financial risks for the company and its workers.
The billionaire has been threatening to pull back from the deal for weeks, but Friday's filing opens a new front in the takeover of the social network, which wields outsize influence over news coverage and politics. Musk's lawyers have repeatedly accused Twitter of failing to turn over data to help his team confirm the number of bots or spam accounts on the social network, setting a stage for a legal battle. Meanwhile, the company maintains it has complied with all of the terms of its agreement and has turned over its ""firehose,"" a massive stream of data comprising more than 500 million tweets posted everyday. Legal experts say Musk's case doesn't meet a threshold to allow him to walk away from the deal.
Even if Twitter does prevail in recovering the deal or recouping a $1 billion breakup fee, a court battle invites new challenges. Twitter could be forced to make key business metrics public, inviting questions from Wall Street about the overall health of the company, which turned its first profit in 2018 amid a major financial retooling.
Donna Hitscherich, a Columbia Business School professor, said Musk's filing will naturally raise questions about why he lost interest.
""Is he a material kind of guy who just changed his mind?"" she said. ""Or is there something really there to what he said might be issues with the fundamental nature of the business?""
After weeks of threats, employees have largely been bracing themselves for Musk to formally attempt to walk. ""This has been the direction of travel for a while,"" said one employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly discuss the situation within the company. ""There's been a general lack of belief that the deal would go through as signed.""
But its arrival only exasperated many workers, who say negotiations with Musk have brought intense scrutiny to Twitter. Any stock downturn would affect employee compensation, adding to the dismay of workers who have largely bristled at the prospect of the world's richest man taking over their company. Since Musk announced his takeover, Twitter has instituted a hiring freeze and has replaced key executives.
Twitter generally has a culture of transparency and open communication, the employee said, but because of the sensitivities around the deal, more information has been on lockdown. Those tensions could worsen if the deal goes to court.
That employee said their reaction to the twists and turns could be summed up most succinctly with a clown emoji.
Another employee, who previously supported the bid, described the situation as ""totally depressing.""
""Musk is destroying Twitter,"" said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for the same reasons. ""The best result for shareholders will be closing the deal at $54.20, even with a hostile owner.""
Musk began complaining about the bot issue soon after he agreed to purchase and take the company private this spring. In a May tweet, he said the deal was ""on hold"" and insisted the purchase could not ""move forward"" until Twitter provided further proof of its methods for detecting spam.
Musk committed to using more than $33 billion of his own wealth, which largely comes from his ownership of Tesla, to complete the deal. But as the stock market has been roiled by a global sell-off of tech stocks, Tesla share values have plummeted. Twitter's stock has dropped 30 percent since Musk made his acquisition announcement, when it traded at $52.
Anticipating more scrutiny of the role of bots in the deal, Twitter gave a Thursday background briefing to reporters. The core of the presentation was about how Twitter calculates its estimate that unwanted bots make up less than 5 percent of what it terms monetizable average daily users, those which the company feels comfortable charging advertisers to reach.
Twitter does not ban all bots, which include purposeful automated accounts, such as those that post otter pictures on the hour or the temperature in a specific location. Instead, the company is looking for indicators that include mass creation accounts or coordination among humans to artificially amplify a tweet, set of tweets or topic.
The company stressed that the fire hose is not enough to understand the state of bots on the platform. Twitter alone can see all the private data, including the phone numbers or email addresses used to register accounts, which would corroborate whether an account is fake. Other critical information includes the IP address and the software configurations of the device using each account, which can pinpoint a single machine behind multiple personas.
Such statements appeared aimed at heading off declarations by Musk that of the fire hose of tweets he has received, a large percentage seemed automated or coordinated. Indeed, Musk's Friday night termination notice claimed that Twitter had not provided him enough data about how it samples the user base.
Twitter's experts acknowledged that individual user might feel that much more than 5 percent of their feed is unwanted content. That is, in part, because the company is measuring and disclosing problematic accounts, not their activity or impressions - so a small number of accounts might have a large footprint of views, especially among spam-heavy topics like crypto. Many others have questioned Twitter's estimate in the past, including numerous academics.
Politicians and advocacy groups are closely scrutinizing disputes between Musk and the company, because they recognize the deal's outcome could have broad implications on the future of elections and political discourse.
Musk has said he would reverse the company's ban on former president Donald Trump, which Twitter instituted shortly after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, citing the ""risk of further incitement of violence."" Musk's plans have been celebrated by conservatives, who accuse the company of censoring political speech, and impugned by liberals, who say his self-proclaimed free-speech absolutist positions could allow harassment and misinformation to run rampant on the platform.
A left-leaning watchdog group said Musk's filing highlights why the deal has been fraught from the start. ""While the fallout from Musk's latest move still unfolds, one thing is clear: this chaotic crusade is nothing short of a five-alarm fire drill,"" said Accountable Tech Executive Director Nicole Gill in a statement. ""Our information ecosystem, safety, and democracy cannot remain at the whim of unaccountable billionaires - whether it's Elon Musk or anyone else.""
Meanwhile, conservatives said the blowup supported their growing push to regulate content moderation of social media at both the state and national level. ""The richest man in the world couldn't even pull this off,"" said Kara Frederick, the director of the Tech Policy Center at the conservative Heritage Foundation, in a Fox News interview Friday night. ""It's time to start talking about policy solutions.""
One of the Twitter employees said there have been discussions within the company about conservatives' concerns with the platform, which employees are working to address, regardless of the outcome of the sale.
Still, the public debacle is unlikely to settle down.
""It was a political firestorm that Musk inserted himself into, and now there's going to be many twists and turns again,"" Ives said. ""You can't put the genie back in the bottle.""

Eight of the top 20 billionaires in the world earned their wealth through the tech sector, according to Bloomberg's billionaires index. Of those tech billionaires, seven are among the top 10 richest overall. The tech billionaires on the list earned their fortunes through industries including automotive, online retail, software and social media. The top seven tech entrepreneurs have a combined net worth topping $936 billion. But they've also lost plenty of cash compared to this time a year ago. According to Bloomberg, the combined net worth of the eight tech billionaires in the top 20 plunged by $256 billion, roughly equal to the gross domestic product of New Zealand, based on World Bank data. Who are the eight tech billionaires and how did they make their money? Here's a breakdown of the tech leaders on Bloomberg's list as of Friday.

284,11-Jul-22,Barron's (Online),"Musk's Twitter Crusade Was a Waste, but Tesla Stock Is Worth a Look",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2687831827/BFD812D457A14912PQ/81?accountid=13946,"Barron's Advisor warned on April 14 that Elon Musk's obsession with Twitter (ticker: TWTR) would be a substantial waste of time, and with the announcement by Musk on Friday that he is withdrawing his $44 billion bid to buy Twitter, that prediction has been borne out. The escapade has been a disaster for shareholders. 
The fallout from Elon Musk's quixotic quest for Twitter could drag on for some time. PHOTO: Photo Illustration by Barron's Advisor; Dreamstime (3)
In the two and a half months since Musk and Twitter agreed to a $54.20-per-share takeout, Twitter stock plunged 29% to Friday's close of $36.81 (and another 10% on Monday to $33), while Tesla has lost a quarter of its value. Both declines are far worse than the 11% drop in the Nasdaq Composite in that time.
The quixotic quest could drag on a bit more, as Twitter's board of directors issued a statement Friday saying it will pursue legal action to make the deal go through on the terms originally agreed. For investors, the best that can be done in the meantime is to drop any hope of making money off Twitter stock. For Tesla (TSLA), however, it could be a different story. And even financial advisors who wouldn't put clients in either stock should be conversant on this twisted tale since it is of great interest to many investors.
A closer look at Twitter. The one-time social media darling was an absolute dog before Musk's interest became public in early April, having fallen 39% in the 12 months leading up to that event. Post-deal, it is likely to be a dog again for some time.
Not only is ongoing legal action likely to be a distraction for management, but Musk's damning recent portrayal of Twitter's business leaves a cloud over the company.
After promising in April to fix Twitter and make it a platform for free speech, Musk said in a filing on Friday that he is terminating the deal because Twitter has violated terms of the agreement. In particular, he said it has repeatedly denied Musk's request for measurements of the daily average mobile users on Twitter. Musk sought such measurements in order to assess how much of Twitter's usage consists of ""fake or spam accounts."" Bots and spam were among Musk's central criticisms of Twitter.
Musk also claimed that based on a partial analysis that he was able to conduct without the requested documents, ""all indications suggest that several of Twitter's public disclosures regarding its mDAUs [mobile daily average users] are either false or materially misleading.""
Problems aren't confined to Musk's remarks, or the legal battle. If the deal does fall through, Musk, who owned 9% of the stock going into the deal, could conceivably liquidate his position. That's a lot of stock to be suddenly dumped on the market.
The request to have substantial disclosure about metrics prior to a deal closing seems an odd condition for acquiring an asset. After all, presumably, Musk would have access to all that data once control was established. Another interpretation is that Musk should have done his due diligence prior to making the offer. That assertion could be used by Twitter to force a deal to go through in court .
Turning to Tesla. In the meantime, there is a chance Tesla stock can improve from here. After falling 25% percent, at Friday's close of $752.29 (it fell another 6% on Monday ), Tesla's valuation multiple has been seriously discounted. Six months ago, the stock had a multiple of enterprise value—the total of market cap plus net cash—divided by projected 12-month sales of 15. Now, that multiple is just 8. Tesla has a solid balance sheet and continues to dominate the electric vehicle market. It is true that a weakened consumer can dent Tesla's sales, but the most recent delivery numbers show demand holding up.
It is possible that despite the coming legal battle, Musk's attention may be more squarely focused on Tesla now that he is presumably giving up amateur sleuthing into Twitter's metrics. That is a point in favor of Tesla's operating cadence. A return of Tesla's stock to something more like the valuation multiple a year ago, 12 times EV to projected sales, would mean 25% upside from the current stock price. That might be the silver lining to this whole fiasco.

 Musk's Twitter Crusade Was a Waste, but Tesla Stock Is Worth a Look

285,11-Jul-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Twitter Didn't Seek a Sale. Now Elon Musk Doesn't Want to Buy. Cue Strange Legal Drama. In trying to terminate his $44 billion takeover deal, Tesla boss sets stage for what could become one of the oddest courtroom battles in corporate-takeover history",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2687615934/BFD812D457A14912PQ/211?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk's showdown with Twitter Inc. has set the stage for what could become one of the most unusual courtroom battles in corporate-takeover history— a spurned acquisition target that never sought to be bought potentially trying to force the buyer who soured on the deal to see it through.
In just over three months, Mr. Musk aggressively pursued a takeover that Twitter first resisted, then he prevailed and reneged—all the while using the very platform to ridicule Twitter and its leaders and drop hints about his shifting intentions.
With Mr. Musk's attempt to terminate his $44 billion takeover , Twitter says it plans legal action. In a statement Friday, it indicated it will file a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery arguing Mr. Musk must close the agreed-upon deal .
Friday evening, he filed papers saying he wanted out, taking aim at Twitter on several fronts and saying the company violated the merger agreement. He accused Twitter of withholding data from him to verify facts about the business and that its statements on the amount of spam on the platform represent material misstatements to regulators. He also argued the company was making critical changes to the ordinary running of the business without his consent, such as imposing a hiring freeze and layoffs.
Corporate-law experts say Twitter appears to be on sounder legal footing than Mr. Musk. The filing didn't provide evidence to back up his assertion that the estimate was inaccurate or an alternate calculation. ""This isn't even in the ballpark,"" said Zohar Goshen, professor of transactional law at Columbia Law School, adding that the impact on a company's value needs to be so dramatic that its value would be halved, for example.
 Layoffs and hiring freezes at tech companies in recent weeks also have become commonplace. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. has cut back on hiring and Mr. Musk's Tesla Inc. is trimming staff.
The question remains whether it is really possible to force the eccentric billionaire— known for eschewing norms even when it gets him in legal trouble —to buy a company he doesn't want to own.
""What are they going to do if there is a judgment and he says, 'Well, I'm still not going to buy it'?"" said Mr. Goshen. ""They don't really have tools to force him to go through with it. You don't put people in jail because they don't buy something.""
There have been a few examples of buyers being forced to follow through with purchases under the ""specific-performance"" clause Mr. Musk agreed to, but most were small deals. Never has the concept of a court forcing a buyer to complete a deal been tested on such a large scale.
Most legal clashes over soured deals end in settlements involving a price cut or one-time payment. Mr. Musk agreed to pay a $1 billion reverse termination fee to Twitter if the deal falls apart, triggered under certain scenarios including if his debt financing falls through or regulators try to block the deal. Neither has occurred.
The clash pits multiple white-shoe law firms against each other. Twitter has recently retained Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, people familiar with the matter said, while Mr. Musk is using Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP. Twitter has already been working with Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP and Wilson Sonsini, while Mr. Musk's team also includes lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.
The agreement caps at $1 billion the amount Twitter could sue for damages, meaning its only options are to sue for specific performance to force him to follow through, or a maximum of $1 billion. A representative for Mr. Musk declined to comment.
 The standoff leaves Twitter in a precarious position, given that its prospects as a stand-alone company are daunting in part because of a digital-advertising market in upheaval. Twitter shares closed at $36.81 Friday, 32% below the $54.20-a-share price Mr. Musk agreed to pay.
Facing broadsides from Mr. Musk and a softening ad market, Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal has been trying to prepare it for a difficult period ahead, whether under Mr. Musk's ownership or not. In May, he announced a hiring freeze and belt tightening, saying he was taking action during the takeover because economic conditions had worsened and Twitter couldn't assume the deal with Mr. Musk would close. This past week, he cut recruiting staff .
Investors appear unnerved by the latest twist, sending Twitter's stock 4.81% lower in Friday after-hours trading following Mr. Musk's disclosure.
Musk's romp
Mr. Musk's Twitter romp began with the unannounced purchase of $22.8 million of Twitter shares on Jan. 31. He kept buying in February and March, building a roughly 9% stake for $2.6 billion and becoming the largest individual investor.
He took public jabs at Twitter, polling his followers on the site over whether it adheres to free-speech principles and publicly toying with the idea of starting a rival . By the time his stake became public on April 4, Mr. Musk had been secretly talking to Twitter for nine days.
 He initially reached out to Jack Dorsey , the company's co-founder and a friend of Mr. Musk's, then spoke to director Egon Durban, co-CEO of private-equity firm Silver Lake, another acquaintance, according to a public filing on the deal.
The discussions began congenially, with Mr. Musk saying he might want to join the board. Then on April 9, hours before taking the board seat Twitter had agreed to give him, he withdrew. Four days later, he made an unsolicited takeover offer at $54.20 a share and made the offer public the subsequent day.
 Twitter initially seemed to turn up its nose but eventually relented—in part because directors concluded that no one else was likely to have the interest or ability to buy the company at the price Mr. Musk was offering. The billionaire agreed to waive detailed due diligence of Twitter's business.
Even as the transaction was coming together, Mr. Musk was voicing concerns about a darkening economic and business outlook. In late March, Tesla had to temporarily shut its auto plant in Shanghai, the company's largest, as China implemented pandemic restrictions, sending the stock steadily lower. And, on an April 20 earnings call, Mr. Musk talked about mounting inflationary pressures .
On May 13, Mr. Musk shocked many people involved in the deal with a predawn tweet saying the deal was ""temporarily on hold."" He later added he remained committed to seeing it through. He cited questions about Twitter's estimate that less than 5% of its monetizable daily average users are spam or fake accounts.
Fake accounts are certainly a concern for social-media companies. But Mr. Musk had long been aware of fake accounts on Twitter—he tweeted about it at least as far back as 2018—and Twitter's estimate hadn't changed in years. Mr. Musk said repeatedly that part of his goal as owner would be, as he put it in an April 21 tweet, to ""defeat the spam bots or die trying!""
The May 13 bombshell kicked off weeks of public and private back and forth between Mr. Musk, Mr. Agrawal and lawyers and advisers for both sides, according to Friday's filing. After Mr. Agrawal on May 16 tweeted an explanation of the company's spam accounting, Mr. Musk responded with a poop emoji, then followed up with a question: ""So how do advertisers know what they're getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter.""
Mr. Musk tweeted about the recent developments, suggesting that if Twitter sues him the company would have to disclose the bot info he sought in court.
Asked on Twitter on May 26 about the prospects of a recession, Mr. Musk said he expected one that could last 12 to 18 months. On May 24, Tesla shares hit their lowest point since June 2021, down nearly 50% from their all-time high in November. The fall had knocked more than $100 billion off Mr. Musk's net worth, weakening a key asset he was using to help fund the Twitter deal.
As he was lining up financing, Mr. Musk sold $8.5 billion of Tesla stock over three days. Afterward, he said he planned to sell no further shares. He remains the auto maker's largest investor, with a stake of around 16%, and planned to borrow against his stake. His original financing plan for Twitter included $12.5 billion from margin loans backed by Tesla stock he owns. But Tesla's share price kept falling , effectively increasing the number of shares Mr. Musk would have to pledge as collateral.
About a month after the deal—with Tesla shares now down 37% from when Mr. Musk agreed to buy Twitter—Mr. Musk filed a revised funding plan that eliminated the margin loans. Instead, he pledged more equity financing. The funding details left questions about how Mr. Musk would come up with roughly $14 billion of his financing package that he still needed to secure himself or through outside investors.
Twitter's troubles
On April 21, Twitter rival Snap Inc. had spooked investors with disappointing earnings and a stark warning of trouble in the digital ad market. Twitter, soon after, withdrew all previously provided goals and outlooks with its first-quarter earnings, and didn't provide any forward-looking guidance.
On May 12, Twitter's Mr. Agrawal told staff the company was imposing a hiring freeze and cutting back on spending.
While some Twitter employees expressed optimism that Mr. Musk might reinvigorate the company, many were bewildered about their futures and upset at Mr. Musk's incessant public hectoring , The Wall Street Journal has reported.
In the month after the deal was inked, executives held more than a dozen companywide or divisionwide meetings to address employee questions. One senior Twitter executive, in a May internal note, called it a ""chaos tax."" 
When Mr. Musk on Friday said he was aiming to abandon the deal, a Twitter executive urged employees to refrain from commenting on the matter, citing planned legal action, according to a message viewed by the Journal. That message was shared with outsiders within an hour.
Mr. Musk on Saturday addressed attendees at the annual Allen & Co. gathering of media and tech leaders in Sun Valley, Idaho, mostly steering clear of Twitter. He focused his remarks on explaining how he forms his opinions and what goes into the conclusions he reaches.
At one point, he did ask his audience how many thought the number of fake accounts on Twitter was less than 5%, said an attendee, and people seemed hesitant to raise a hand.

 Twitter Didn't Seek a Sale. Now Elon Musk Doesn't Want to Buy. Cue Strange Legal Drama.

286,11-Jul-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Twitter Is the Biggest Musk Loser,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2687629249/BFD812D457A14912PQ/468?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk's decision Friday to call off his purchase of Twitter is a loss for the social-media site as well as for political free speech. The only winners will be progressives who support the site's censorship of views that don't conform to theirs on politics, climate and many other subjects.
Critics say Mr. Musk was never serious about buying Twitter, but he sure went a long way to show he was. He now faces a $1 billion breakup fee, as well as extensive litigation with the company. Mr. Musk offered $54.20 a share, but the stock had fallen to $36.81 before Friday's announcement. It fell to $35.04 in after-hours trading.
Mr. Musk's takeover financing was heavily leveraged and became more precarious as interest rates rose. He initially offered Tesla shares as collateral, but then sought to replace margin loans by bringing in other investors as Tesla shares fell along with the market. He has accused Twitter of undercounting spam accounts and a lack of transparency.
The site's user growth is slowing, and it has lost $1.3 billion over the past two years even as tech-company profits have boomed. In February Twitter borrowed $1 billion in private markets. But debt is becoming more expensive, and other mooted suitors with the means to buy Twitter could encounter regulatory obstacles.
Mr. Musk may be hoping to negotiate a lower purchase price, but if he does walk away it will be a loss for political discourse. Tweets by conservatives that present even purely factual information about subjects like Covid treatments and climate are often labelled misinformation. Accounts are suspended without explanation, and appeals go answered. Nobody knows who the wizards are behind the curtains making these decisions, and Mr. Musk says he'd allow more open debate.
A Musk purchase would be a free-market solution to the progressive dominance of tech platforms. Republicans are promising to target tech-company censorship if they win control of Congress in November, and Twitter will be one of the first in line. This could also frighten investors and potential buyers.
Twitter can help itself by ending its one-sided political censorship, but its woke staff and corporate culture might make that impossible. The company might find it needed Mr. Musk more than he needed Twitter.

287,11-Jul-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Is Walking Away from the Twitter Deal. Here's How It Could Still Happen.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2687712324/BFD812D457A14912PQ/589?accountid=13946,"Twitter vs. Musk could be a long, drawn-out legal battle which may do more harm than good for the social media platform's employees and shareholders if any additional internal data is exposed in litigation with the Tesla (ticker: TSLA) billionaire.
That's the view of Benchmark analyst Mark Zgutowicz, who argues that that a Twitter (TWTR) bid at $37-a-share is a good compromise—and that $27-a-share is the best case reset if one is not found.
In a research note on Monday, Zgutowicz maintained its Buy rating on Twitter as the saga continues. Twitter shares fell 5.32% to $34.76 in the premarket Monday after Musk said late Friday he was terminating his $44 billion takeover of the company, which vowed to take legal action to force him to follow through.
""We still believe Elon Musk would ultimately like to change the course of Twitter, but at a price 'better aligned' with the market and company fundamentals,"" the analyst wrote.
""Last Friday's ~$37 closing price would appear a good compromise as it still reflects a hefty relative user premium to faster growing peers"" while at the same time ""yielding room for Musk's objections to active user data/methodologies,"" the analyst wrote.
With no compromise, Zgutowicz thinks the base case for twitter shares is around $27, reflecting the company's enterprise value to its revenue for 2022 at around 85% of that of Snap (SNAP).
In a separate note, MKM Partners analysts led by Rohit Kulkarni also compared Twitters value to peers. That led them to write that shares ""would likely find support around $24 to $26 per share, if investors start to assign a greater probability that this merger will not happen.""

 Elon Musk Is Walking Away from the Twitter Deal. Here's How It Could Still Happen.

288,11-Jul-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition","Musk Is Twitter's Material Adverse Effect --- A settlement would beat a protracted legal battle for both sides, but the social network still has to contend with the aftermath",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2687629223/BFD812D457A14912PQ/613?accountid=13946,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Elon Musk wants to leave Twitter at the altar, having mistaken lust for love. Walking away will still cost him, but it is a better outcome for both sides. The question for Twitter's shareholders is how much worse off it will be than before its brief dalliance with the famous billionaire.
In a filing on Friday, Mr. Musk's lawyers declared his intention to terminate the merger agreement he signed in April with the social-media platform. His claim is that Twitter breached their deal by failing to provide Mr. Musk with requested information to settle questions about bots and an allegedly inflated user count. Mr. Musk, through his lawyer, is accusing the social network of ""materially inaccurate representations,"" and added for good measure his belief that the portion of spam and fake accounts in Twitter's user base is ""wildly higher"" than the less-than-5% figure Twitter has historically claimed in its regulatory filings.
Twitter says it is planning a lawsuit to compel Mr. Musk to honor the agreement. In a strict legal sense, the social network might have the upper hand: Mr. Musk waived his due-diligence rights in signing the deal, and the objections he raised came conveniently after electric-vehicle maker Tesla lost about one-third of its market value, thus denting the very net worth Mr. Musk was leveraging to finance the Twitter acquisition.
But a protracted legal battle isn't in either side's interest. Mr. Musk could be forced to write a big check years from now for the husk of a social-media company he once coveted. Or Twitter's shareholders could walk away with a mere $1 billion consolation prize in that parlous state.
True, a settlement even significantly north of the $1 billion breakup fee agreed to in the merger won't go far to erase the $14.7 billion difference between the $54.20 per-share deal price and the $35 that Twitter's shares hit after-hours on Friday following Mr. Musk's termination filing. Indeed, Twitter's shares would likely be far lower even if the stock simply tracked the damage done to its social-network peers over the past three months, as concerns about the health of online advertising in a highly inflationary environment were affirmed by a warning from Snapchat parent Snap Inc. in late May. A drop in line with the Nasdaq CTA Internet Index would put Twitter's shares slightly below the $30 mark now.
And, unfortunately, that is a best-case scenario that assumes Twitter emerges from the Musk melee unscathed. That appears unlikely. If Mr. Musk's initial interest made Twitter seem like an undervalued darling, the problems he has both raised and arguably caused over the past few months could change a lot of minds.
One thing clear long before Mr. Musk raised his concerns is that it is impossible to know just how many ""real"" users Twitter's platform has. Certainly it isn't a problem unique to Twitter; all social-media platforms disclose their ""best estimates"" of their respective user bases, noting they are likely inaccurate to some degree.
Meta Platforms recently disclosed in a filing that around 11% of monthly active users for its Facebook app could be duplicate accounts. Twitter has said it misstated its users for 12 consecutive quarters through the end of last year, giving itself credit for several accounts being owned by a single user.
But Mr. Musk has one of the world's loudest megaphones as one of only a handful of Twitter accounts with more than 100 million followers. That gives his public questioning of the integrity of the platform extra weight.
And even he seems to have overestimated Twitter's external appeal. An analysis published by Pew Research last month showed nine in 10 journalists use Twitter for their jobs, but 13% of American adults say they regularly get news on Twitter. That is nearly the same percentage who report getting their news from Instagram and significantly less than the 31% who said they get their news from Facebook.
Perhaps most concerning is what the past few months have done to Twitter's management and talent base. As Mr. Musk's own lawyers point out in Friday's letter, three key executives resigned from Twitter since the merger was announced. It is possible those departures were spurred by the prospect of the merger, especially after Mr. Musk showed a propensity to publicly criticize Twitter employees and made clear that, regardless of his title, things would be run his way or the highway. But the damage is done, and Twitter under the glare of the new spotlight with or without the deal might remain an unappealing place to work.
At the end of the day, Mr. Musk's case is all about ""material adverse effects"" -- the user numbers, the bots, the management. But for Twitter's investors, the Musk affair may prove to have the worst effects of all.

289,12-Jul-22,The Washington Post,What's with Musk's Twitter-deal madness?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2687936577/BFD812D457A14912PQ/254?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk is not just your garden-variety weird billionaire; he extends a weapons-grade weirdness field around him that makes everything he touches turn weird, too. Case in point, the Twitter acquisition - which Musk announced this weekend he's walking away from.
Musk's main explanation is he believes there are too many bots using the service. As reasons go, this is kind of weird, because there's not much evidence that Twitter is sufficiently bot-infested to materially complicate the deal. Musk is surely aware that there are plenty of real people on Twitter, since as Bloomberg's Matt Levine pointed out, that's where he met the mother of some of his children.
The sudden obsession with bots strikes most knowledgeable observers as an obviously pretextual excuse to cancel the merger, or at least to renegotiate its price now that the stock market has tanked. But this is really not that much less weird. Chancery judges are not very fond of BS excuses, nor of people who whimsically offer to buy a company, then try to get out of it with the legal equivalent of a text reading LOL JK hahahahah. They can, and probably will, at least make him pay the deal's $1 billion breakup fee. They might force him to pony up $44 billion to buy the company as promised.
But then we get to the truly weird thing: If Musk can get out of this for $1 billion (plus hefty lawyer's fees), he'll probably end up making money on the debacle.
Musk may be the richest guy in the world, but most of his net worth consists of Tesla stock and stock options. If you're a Tesla shareholder, that's exactly how you want it, because your interests and his are tightly aligned. But if you're Musk's financial adviser - or, you know, Musk himself - you would probably like a little insurance, in the form of other investments, in case this whole electric car thing doesn't work out.
Unfortunately, it's somewhat difficult for a CEO in that situation to do the obvious thing: selling some of his company's stock to buy other stocks. When you're the richest guy in the world, you need to sell quite a lot of stock just to diversify a fraction of your net worth. Selling that big a chunk of one stock will saturate the market and make the price fall, so all your other shares will be worth less - particularly after people start asking themselves why Tesla's CEO doesn't want his shares.
It has recently become urgent that Musk solve this problem, because in 2012, he was awarded nearly 23 million Tesla stock options that will expire this August. He has presumably been sitting on them to put off paying taxes on them, but he has reached the ""use it or lose it"" point. Might that explain why Musk has started manufacturing what seem like excuses to sell stock?
In November, Musk offered his followers a Twitter poll. ""Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance,"" read the question, ""so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock. Do you support this?"" The ayes had it, 58 to 42 percent, and Musk sold $5 billion worth of shares a few days later.
On the one hand this was a very Muskian troll of Democratic legislators who have lately taken to proposing impractical and destructive plans to tax unrealized capital gains. On the other, it was a great excuse to sell shares. Now when people asked why Musk was divesting, instead of saying ""because I want to have something to fall back on if Tesla underperforms,"" he could say ""because I am a wild and crazy guy who likes to troll libs on Twitter.""
Now, in a rational world, ""I love trolling more than my company"" should probably make you less bullish on the future of Tesla, but here on Earth Prime, the lib-trolling is one reason his most avid fans love him, and the company he runs. This barely caused a hiccup in the stock.
In April, Musk sold another $8.4billion as he raised funds for the Ultimate Troll: buying Twitter itself. Between then and now, the stock market has swooned, and the value of Tesla has declined by more than a quarter. In other words, if Musk had held onto those shares, he'd have about $6 billion worth of stock. Instead, he got $8.4 billion worth of cash. Even if he gives $1 billion of that to Twitter, he's still more than a billion dollars to the good.
Musk couldn't have known he was selling close to the peak, of course; the timing was fortuitous. But it's nonetheless excellent reason for a judge to force Musk to go through with it. Otherwise, his good fortune will become legend and encourage more frivolous deals.
Things are weird enough already in the market. We don't need to give anyone encouragement to make them worse.

290,12-Jul-22,Barron's (Online),Twitter Sues Elon Musk to Force Him to Honor Deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2688230976/BFD812D457A14912PQ/575?accountid=13946,"As expected, Twitter has asked a Delaware court to force Elon Musk to honor his $44 billion deal to buy the social media company.
 In a filing late Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Musk had disclosed a letter from his attorney declaring his intention to terminate the transaction. Musk's lawyer asserted thatTwitter (ticker: TWTR) had materially breached the acquisition agreement by declining to provide full information about fake accounts on the service.
The letter, signed by Skadden, Arps, Slate Meagher & Flom attorney Mike Ringler, asserted that ""Twitter has failed or refused to provide this information. Sometimes Twitter has ignored Mr. Musk's requests, sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified, and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving Mr. Musk incomplete or unusable information.""
In response to Musk's filing, Twitter on Friday vowed to file suit to enforce the terms of the transaction. And the company now has fulfilled that promise, filing an action in Delaware Chancery Court which seeks to compel Musk to proceed with his $54.20 a share cash offer to acquire the company.
In its filing to the court on Tuesday, Twitter asserted that Musk had no valid reason to terminate his offer.
""Musk refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests,"" Twitter said in the court filing. ""Having mounted a public spectacle to put Twitter in play, and having proposed and then signed a seller-friendly merger agreement, Musk apparently believes that he—unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law—is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away. This repudiation follows a long list of material contractual breaches by Musk that have cast a pall over Twitter and its business.""
Musk himself had pledged $33.5 billion of his own money to back the deal, which had no financing contingency and no due diligence condition. Twitter noted in the filing that Musk had originally presented his offer on a take-it-or-leave it basis.
""Twitter brings this action to enjoin Musk from further breaches, to compel Musk to fulfill his legal obligations, and to compel consummation of the merger upon satisfaction of the few outstanding conditions,"" the filing said.
In the lawsuit, Twitter asserts that Musk now ""wants out,"" largely due to the sharp decline in the stock market, which has reduced the value of both other social media stocks and Musk's stake in the automaker Tesla (TSLA).
""Rather than bear the cost of the market downturn, as the merger agreement requires, Musk wants to shift it to Twitter's stockholders,"" the company said. ""Since signing the merger agreement, Musk has repeatedly disparaged Twitter and the deal, creating business risk for Twitter and downward pressure on its share price.""
The company also says that Musk's assertion that there is an issue around fake accounts is ""a model of hypocrisy,"" noting that Musk had previously said that one of the reasons he wanted to buy Twitter was to get rid of spam on the site.
In a tweet, Musk responded Tuesday afternoon by simply saying ""oh the irony LOL,"" an apparent reference to Twitter shifting from a reluctant seller to one now attempting to force the sale of the company to Musk.
Twitter is a Delaware company (as are nearly two million companies, including most of the Fortune 500). Delaware's Court of Chancery, the 230-year-old institution, has a reputation for being strict about contractual obligations, according to lawyers familiar with the court. It has been center stage for many of the highest profile corporate battles in recent years, including 2020's merger fight between LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co.
Twiter shares on Tuesday rallied 4.3%, to $34.06. The stock added another 1.2% in late trading.

291,12-Jul-22,The Washington Post,Twitter shares slide after Musk moves to cancel takeover,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2687936581/BFD812D457A14912PQ/617?accountid=13946,"Twitter has been thrust into the awkward position of going to court to enforce a takeover it wasn't even sure it wanted in the first place. 
But with its stock in a nosedive - falling another 11.3 percent on Monday after Elon Musk moved Friday to back out of the $44 billion deal - Twitter's board is expected to file a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery as soon as this week to keep the billionaire Tesla CEO on the hook.
The board has a responsibility to get the best value for shareholders, experts say, and right now that path appears likely to involve a lengthy legal battle to compel Musk to fulfill the agreement.
The monetary stakes are clear: Twitter shares fell to their lowest point in two months on Monday after Musk announced he was ""terminating their merger agreement"" in a regulatory filing. The stock closed at $32.65, nearly 40 percent below the $54.20 a share price that Musk agreed to pay in April.
""It puts the Twitter board in a tough position,"" said David Larcker, a professor at Stanford's graduate school of business who studies corporate governance. ""Either the court is going to force him to buy the company, the court is going to let him off the hook with a buyout - or something else is going to happen.""
Another option could include a possible renegotiation or settlement.
The would-be deal has been tumultuous from the start, since Musk launched his hostile takeover bid in April. It initially appeared as the though company might pass, but the board was persuaded that a sale would be in the best interest of the company and shareholders. In the months that followed, Musk has regularly criticized Twitter on its own platform. Many employees have voiced concerns he would fundamentally alter operations, slash jobs and roll back content safeguards that had been put in place over years.
Ultimately, Musk's decision to drop the bid stems from his insistence the company is withholding information on bot accounts; Twitter contends it has turned over significant information.
Legal experts have said that it will be difficult for Musk to just walk away from the deal with that reasoning. He could be on the hook for a $1 billion breakup fee, and potentially more after court proceedings. Twitter has retained a prominent New York law firm to help it complete the sale.
Twitter sent a letter to Musk on Sunday, saying that his move to terminate the agreement is ""invalid and wrongful"" and demanding that Musk fulfill his obligations.
The dropping stock price, uneasy workforce and general uncertainty plays into a ""worst-case scenario"" for the company even if it prevails in court, experts say, because it opens the company to new financial risks. Twitter could be forced to make key business metrics public, inviting skepticism from Wall Street about the company's health.
Musk appeared to be of the same mind, tweeting just after midnight Monday: ""They said I couldn't buy Twitter. Then they wouldn't disclose bot info. Now they want to force me to buy Twitter in court. Now they have to disclose bot info in court.""
The tweet included a meme with photos of Musk laughing.
Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, believes the suit will end in a settlement ""sooner rather than later, just because everybody is dissatisfied on both sides.""
The broader market ended in sharply lower Monday as investors geared up for earnings season. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slumped about 2.3 percent to close at 11,372.60, while the S&P 500 sank 1.2 percent to end at 3,854.43. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.5 percent, or nearly 165 points, to settle at 31,173.84.
Investors will be closely monitoring financial results from the major banks this week, including JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley on Thursday, and Wells Fargo, PNC Financial and Citigroup on Friday, to gauge the health of the economy. Experts say the amounts they have in reserve - the amount of cash they hold to meet central bank requirements - matters because it shows their level of concern about a recession.
Wall Street has been trying to regroup after closing out the first half of the year with steep losses in the face of soaring prices and geopolitical turmoil. Changing monetary policy has fueled much of those declines this year: The Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate three times in 2022 in an attempt to tamp down inflation and signaled that four more increases are on the docket. The most recent hike, in June, came in at three-quarters of a percentage point, the Fed's largest since 1994.
This week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release inflation data for June. In May, the consumer price index rose 8.6 percent, a 40-year high. The Biden administration and the Fed have warned that prices will continue to rise until supply chains and consumer demand recalibrate and the economy recovers.
""The hope among investors and traders is that this week they will get to see a reading that will confirm that inflation in the U.S. has reached its peak level, and if that happens, it will provide some comfort to many traders in the market,"" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade.

292,12-Jul-22,Telegraph - Herald,What's next in Musk-Twitter saga?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2688267738/BFD812D457A14912PQ/686?accountid=13946,"BY BARBARA ORTUTAY
The Associated Press
Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Twitter are bracing for a legal fight after the billionaire said Friday he was abandoning his $44 billion bid for the social media company.
Twitter is vowing to challenge Musk in court to uphold the agreement. Shares of Twitter slid more than 9% on Monday. Here's a look at what could happen next:
WHY IS MUSK BACKING OUT?
There are a lot of reasons why Musk might have had second thoughts. But he alleged Friday that Twitter has failed to provide enough information about the number of fake accounts it has.
Twitter said last month that it was making available to Musk a ""firehose"" of public raw data on hundreds of millions of daily tweets. But Musk's lawyers have argued that the company was providing Musk with sometimes ""incomplete or unusable information"" and less data than it offers some of its big customers.
Twitter said last week it uses a mix of public and private data to determine the amount of spam. Private user data isn't available publicly and thus isn't in the data ""firehose"" that it gave Musk. Twitter has said for years in regulatory filings that it believes about 5% of the accounts on the platform are fake.
TWITTER'S RESPONSE
Twitter declared its intent to sue Musk. The company could have pushed for a $1 billion breakup fee that Musk agreed to pay under these circumstances. Instead, it looks ready to fight to complete the purchase, which the company's board has approved and CEO Parag Agrawal has insisted he wants to consummate.
The chair of Twitter's board, Bret Taylor, tweeted Friday that the board is ""committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon"" with Musk and ""plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement.
WHO'S GOING TO WIN?
It's almost impossible to predict the outcome of any protracted legal battle. But law and business experts believe Twitter likely has the stronger case.
Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi noted that Twitter has described its estimate of fake and spam accounts for years in regulatory filings while explicitly noting that the number might not be accurate given the use of data samples and interpretation.
Given current market conditions, Mogharabi said, Twitter may also have a solid argument that the layoffs and firings of the past weeks represent ""an ordinary course of business.""
""Many technology firms have begun to control costs by reducing headcount and/or delaying adding employees,"" he said. ""The resignations of Twitter employees cannot with certainty be attributed to any change in how Twitter has operated since Musk's offer was accepted by the board and shareholders.""
The case could also end in a settlement, for instance with the two sides negotiating a lower price. If Musk wins, there's also the question of the $1 billion breakup fee. He can certainly afford it, but will he want to pay?
WHAT HAPPENS now TO TWITTER?
The Musk saga has been, to put it mildly, a distraction for Twitter's workers, executives and even users. Some employees have quit, while others were laid off or fired. Job offers have been rescinded and discretionary spending curtailed.
""""For Twitter this fiasco is a nightmare scenario,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who follows the company, wrote Monday. He said the result would be ""an Everest-like uphill climb for Parag & Co."" given concerns over employee morale and retention, advertiser concerns and other challenges.""
Twitter itself is unlikely to go anywhere regardless of whether or not it changes hands. But if the turmoil continues it could scare away advertisers. If too many engineers and other employees leave, the platform's quality could suffer as well.
""The one bright spot is that if (Twitter) is ultimately victorious in the courts, it could potentially take north of the $1B in break-up fees that Musk could have to pay,"" said CFRA Analyst Angelo Zino."
293,12-Jul-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Musk Leaves Twitter Weakened and Vulnerable: [National Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2687973807/BFD812D457A14912PQ/697?accountid=13946,"Mr. Musk swooped in and exposed Twitter's lack of business and financial prospects. After criticizing the company's weaknesses, he now wants to back out of buying it.SAN FRANCISCO -- For years, Twitter was a runner-up social media company. It never grew to the size and scale of a Facebook or an Instagram. It simply muddled along.Then, Elon Musk, a power user of the service, stormed in. He offered $44 billion to buy Twitter and declared that the company could perform far better if he were in charge. He disparaged Twitter's executives, ridiculed its content policies, complained about the product and confused its more than 7,000 employees with his pronouncements. As Mr. Musk revealed the company's lack of business and financial prospects, Twitter's stock plunged more than 30 percent.Now, as Mr. Musk, a billionaire, tries to back out of the blockbuster deal, he is inexorably leaving Twitter worse off than it was when he said he would buy it. With each needling tweet and public taunt, Mr. Musk has eroded trust in the social media company, walloped employee morale, spooked potential advertisers, emphasized its financial difficulties and spread misinformation about how Twitter operates.""His engagement with Twitter took a severe toll on the company,"" said Jason Goldman, a member of Twitter's founding team who has also served on its board of directors. ""Employees, advertisers and the market at large cannot have conviction in a company whose path is unknowable and which will now go to court to complete a transaction with a bad-faith actor.""The precarious situation underscores why Twitter is set to sue Mr. Musk as soon as this week to force a completion of the deal. The court battle is likely to be protracted and immense, involving months of expensive litigation and high-stakes negotiations by elite lawyers. A resolution is far from certain -- Twitter might win, but, if it loses, Mr. Musk could walk away by paying a breakup fee. Or the two sides could renegotiate or settle.On Monday, the damage that Mr. Musk, 51, has inflicted was evident. Twitter's stock plunged more than 11 percent to one of its lowest points since 2020 as investors anticipated the coming legal battle. Since Twitter accepted Mr. Musk's acquisition offer, on April 25, its stock has lost over a third of its value as investors have grown increasingly skeptical that the deal would get done on the agreed terms. (In contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index was down about 12.5 percent in the same period.)Twitter declined to comment on Monday. In a letter to Mr. Musk's lawyers on Sunday, the company's lawyers said that his move to terminate the deal was ""invalid and wrongful"" and that Mr. Musk ""knowingly, intentionally, willfully and materially breached"" his agreement to buy the firm. Twitter would continue to provide information to Mr. Musk and to work to close the transaction, the letter added.Mr. Musk did not return requests for comment. On Sunday, the billionaire, who has cited the number of fake accounts on Twitter's platform as the reason that he cannot buy the company, tweeted a picture of himself laughing at the situation.Of all the wreckage Mr. Musk is leaving at Twitter, the most prominent may be how brutally he exposed the company's waning financial and business prospects. Twitter has operated at a loss for seven of the nine years it has been a public company. During deliberations over Mr. Musk's offer, the company received no serious interest from other suitors, people with knowledge of the situation have said. Twitter's board determined that Mr. Musk's offer of $54.20 a share was the best it could obtain, suggesting it saw no way to reach that price on its own.""The board's lack of conviction in the company's long-term future will linger over employees, partners and shareholders regardless of the outcome with Elon,"" Mr. Goldman said.In recent months, Twitter's business has deteriorated. Parag Agrawal, Twitter's chief executive, said in a memo to employees in May that the company had not lived up to its business and financial goals. To address the issues, he pushed out the heads of product and revenue, instituted a hiring slowdown and began an effort to attract new users and diversify into e-commerce. In April, the company stopped providing a forward-looking financial outlook to investors, pending the acquisition.That trajectory is unlikely to change as uncertainty over the deal discomfits advertisers, the main source of Twitter's revenue.""Twitter will have trouble in the near future reassuring skittish advertisers and their users that they're going to be stable,"" said Angelo Carusone, the president of the watchdog group Media Matters for America.In what was an implicit dig at Twitter's top executives, Mr. Musk said he could have done way better with the company. In a presentation to investors in May, he said he planned to quintuple the company's revenue to $26.4 billion by 2028 and to reach 931 million users that same year, up from 217 million at the end of last year.Mr. Musk emphasized Twitter's rudderless financial direction in a letter filed to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday. The company's ""declining business prospects and financial outlook"" had given him pause, his lawyers wrote, especially considering Twitter's recent ""financial performance and revised outlook"" on the fiscal year ahead.Mr. Musk, who has more than 100 million followers on Twitter, has also jackhammered the product, saying it is not as attractive as other apps. He has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that Twitter is overrun with more inauthentic accounts than it has disclosed; such accounts can be automated to pump out toxic or false content. (The company has said fewer than 5 percent of the accounts on its platform are fake.)His barbs about fake accounts have weakened trust in Twitter, just as the company prepares to moderate heated political discussions about an upcoming election in Brazil and the midterm elections this fall in the United States, misinformation experts said.In another criticism of Twitter and the way it supervises content, Mr. Musk vowed to unwind the company's moderation policies in the name of free speech. In May, he said he would ""reverse the permanent ban"" of former President Donald J. Trump from Twitter, allowing Mr. Trump back on the social network. That riled up right-wing users, who have long accused the company of censoring them, and renewed questions about how Twitter should handle debates over the limits of free speech.Inside the company, employee morale has been battered, leading to infighting and attrition, according to six current and former employees.Some of those who remain said they were relieved that Mr. Musk seemed to have decided against owning the company. Others shared nihilistic memes on the company's Slack or openly criticized Twitter's board and executives for entertaining Mr. Musk's offer in the first place, according to internal messages viewed by The New York Times. The mood among executives was one of grim determination, two people with knowledge of their thinking said.Evan Williams, a founder of Twitter, tweeted on Friday that he wished for an end to Mr. Musk's antics.""If I was still on the board, I'd be asking if we can just let this whole ugly episode blow over,"" Mr. Williams posted in response to the announcement that Twitter intended to sue Mr. Musk and force the deal forward. ""Hopefully that's the plan and this is ceremony.""Manu Cornet, a Twitter employee, illustrated the mood with a cartoon that showed a shattered company that had been bumped off a shelf by Mr. Musk's careless elbow.

294,13-Jul-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"What Happened to the Twitter-Elon Musk Deal? Tesla CEO says he is seeking to terminate his $44 billion deal to buy the social-media platform, setting up a legal battle",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2688288603/BFD812D457A14912PQ/177?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk said he is seeking to terminate his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter Inc., nearly two months after saying the deal was ""on hold"" over his questions about the number of spam and fake accounts on the platform.
Twitter ""is in material breach of multiple provisions of that agreement,"" according to a letter from Mr. Musk's lawyer filed with securities regulators. The letter also accused the company of making ""false and misleading representations"" when entering into the agreement.
Twitter in response sued Mr. Musk , seeking to enforce the terms of the deal and setting up a legal battle over what comes next for the social-media platform.
Here's what to know.
Why did Elon Musk say he was pulling out of his deal to buy Twitter?
Mr. Musk said in a regulatory filing Friday that the company hadn't provided the necessary data and information he needs to assess the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on the platform. In the filing, Mr. Musk's lawyers said that Twitter had made material changes to the business without his consent, such as laying off some staff and implementing a hiring freeze.
What will happen next in the Twitter deal?
Twitter has sued Mr. Musk over his attempt to walk away from the deal. In filing the lawsuit, Twitter requested expedited treatment of the case. Expedited cases in the Delaware Court of Chancery, where the suit was filed, typically play out over the course of a few months rather than many months or years.
Can Twitter force Elon Musk to go through with the deal?
That question will get tested in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Corporate law experts say Twitter appears to be on sounder legal footing than Mr. Musk, who accused the company of breaching their contract. Still, should Twitter prevail in court, there is little precedent to draw on for forcing a buyer to go through with a deal on such a large scale .
What's the current price of the Twitter stock?
After Mr. Musk signaled his intent to walk away from buying Twitter, the company's shares fell $4.16, or 11.3% to $32.65, their biggest one-day drop in more than two months. They recovered somewhat on July 12 amid a broader market recovery and rose around 1% in post-market trading after the lawsuit was filed.
Why were Twitter's spam accounts a point of contention for Elon Musk?
Mr. Musk has said the spam and fake accounts issue is fundamental to Twitter's business and financial performance, and that getting clarity is necessary for him to line up financing for the deal.
He tweeted in May that the deal was ""on hold"" over details about spam and fake accounts on the platform. The following month, he threatened in a letter to the company to end the deal if Twitter didn't provide data he had requested. He has said the deal wouldn't proceed unless he could see such data to evaluate the company's claims about how many of its users are spam or fake accounts .
Many observers have speculated that Mr. Musk was using the fake accounts issue as leverage to renegotiate or exit the acquisition, given that he was aware of the issue long before agreeing to buy Twitter, and yet waived due diligence on the business prior to inking the deal.
Twitter has long estimated that spam or fake accounts represent fewer than 5% of its monetizable daily active users, which it most recently pegged at 229 million. Mr. Musk has said he thinks the number could be closer to 20%. Twitter provided access to the platform's full fire hose of tweets, but data specialists say analyzing it isn't easy.
Mr. Musk, as one of Twitter's highest-profile users, is particularly susceptible to seeing spam on the platform , according to researchers.
In the regulatory filing, Mr. Musk's lawyer said, ""Twitter has ignored Mr. Musk's requests, sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified, and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving Mr. Musk incomplete or unusable information.""
Twitter, in its lawsuit, said it has ""bent over backwards"" to provide Mr. Musk the information he has requested.
What are the financial stakes in the deal?
Mr. Musk had agreed in April to buy Twitter for $44 billion, or $54.20 a share.
He said he didn't care about making money from the deal: ""Having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization. I don't care about the economics at all,"" Mr. Musk said in an April interview .
Mr. Musk, as he lined up financing for the deal, sold more than $8 billion in Tesla Inc. stock.
Shares in the electric-vehicle maker advanced more than 2% after Mr. Musk said he was done with his Twitter pursuit that had annoyed some of the billionaire's Tesla fans .
Also potentially losing out in the deal are financial institutions looking to make it happen. Twitter's bankers would stand to make tens of millions in advisory fees on closing, according to a previous regulatory disclosure. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. would stand to make around $80 million, including $15 million upfront, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. could make $53 million, including $5 million upfront.

Why was Elon Musk interested in the deal?
Mr. Musk has called Twitter the ""de facto town square,"" and said he wanted to buy the platform because he thought it was important for there to be ""an inclusive arena for free speech.""
Mr. Musk, who has over 100 million followers on the platform, indicated he would seek to make substantial changes to the social-media site, including softening the way it moderates content and supporting an edit button for tweets—something the company was already working on. He also said he would try to eliminate bots, rely less on advertising and enable encrypted messaging. He said he planned to take the company private, which would have made it easier to implement desired changes without shareholder pressure.

 What Happened to the Twitter-Elon Musk Deal?

295,13-Jul-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk: 'Lithium Batteries Are the New Oil',https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2688676808/BFD812D457A14912PQ/408?accountid=13946,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk defined energy independence for an electric-vehicle world. You have to have the batteries .
Responding to a tweet Wednesday which said there is no security without energy independence, Tesla's (ticker: TSLA) CEO agreed , adding ""and lithium batteries are the new oil.""
Batteries might be the future. For now, oil is still the new oil. The U.S. uses about 20 million barrels of oil used in the U.S. each day. (About 8 million barrels are imported.) And about two thirds of that oil ends up in gas tanks, according to the Energy Department .
Prices for gasoline are soaring, partly as a consequence of the war between Russian and Ukraine—something well beyond the control of most Americans or American corporations.
Consumers and businesses feel the pain of higher prices, though. The U.S. consumer price index rose 9.1% year over year in June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . Gasoline prices are a big part of overall inflation. They are up about 63% year over year.
High oil prices are one reason interest in electric vehicles is higher. The American Automobile Association reported Wednesday that 25% of new car buyers surveyed are considering an EV for their next car. High gas prices were cited as the biggest reason consumers are considering the switch.
But like Musk points out, EVs don't completely solve the problem of energy independence. It trades the oil problem for a lithium-ion battery problem.
OPEC nations don't produce many lithium-ion batteries. Production is dominated by Asia. China's Contemporary Amperex Technology (300750.China), better known as CATL, makes about 30% of the world's EV batteries, according to Ford Motor (F) CEO Jim Farley.
CATL has grown into a huge company. It's $200 billion market-capitalization rivals Toyota Motor (TM). Toyota, as well as Farley and Musk along with other auto executives, are working to take some of that market share. Traditional auto companies have announced billion in spending to build battery plants in the U.S. The volume closely matches goals for total EV production.
Most auto makers, including General Motors (GM) and Ford, believe roughly 50% of new car sales will be battery electric by 2030. That could mean up to 10 million EVs a year in the U.S. alone.
That production requires, perhaps, 800 gigawatt hours of battery-making capacity. That's about 80% of global battery capacity in 2021.
Making batteries in the U.S. is part of the lithium-ion battery independence equation. The materials that go into batteries is another factor. Lithium is mined, mainly, in South America and Australia. The lithium is processed largely in China.
Other materials, such as nickel and cobalt come from many other countries. Auto makers, including Tesla, might consider investing further up the battery value chain to insulate themselves from commodity-price shocks like the one that U.S. drivers are experiencing in 2022.
If Musk is right, then that, along with building battery capacity, looks like the smartest strategy to build a competitive advantage in EVs.

296,13-Jul-22,Los Angeles Times,"BUSINESS; Twitter sues Musk over aborted offer; Suit seeks to force the billionaire to finish the deal, which has a $1-billion breakup fee.",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2688322300/BFD812D457A14912PQ/434?accountid=13946,"Twitter sued Elon Musk over his abandoned $44-billion takeover offer, accusing the billionaire of having buyer's remorse after his fortune declined.
Lawyers for Twitter told a Delaware judge that the world's richest man failed to honor his agreement to pay $54.20 a share for the San Francisco social media platform. Musk abandoned the deal Friday, citing in part concerns about the number of fake accounts among users.
The filing sets up what will be a closely watched court battle between Musk and Twitter, a communications tool that the billionaire favors but where his missives have previously gotten him into legal trouble. The lawsuit hit back at a number of Musk's claims, saying that Twitter ""has bent over backwards"" to provide Musk with the information he requested.

""Having mounted a public spectacle to put Twitter in play, and having proposed and then signed a seller-friendly merger agreement, Musk apparently believes that he -- unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law -- is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value and walk away,"" Twitter said in its filing.
Twitter Chairman Bret Taylor said last week that the company planned to pursue legal action against Musk, and in a letter released Monday, its lawyers called the deal termination ""invalid and wrongful.""
Musk backed out of the deal to buy the platform Friday, saying in a regulatory filing that the company has made ""misleading representations"" over the number of so-called spam bots on the service. Twitter hasn't ""complied with its contractual obligations"" to provide information about how to assess how prevalent the bots are on the social media service, Musk said in a letter to Twitter that was included in the regulatory filing.
Musk also argued that Twitter has failed to maintain its normal course of business operations. The company instituted a hiring freeze, fired senior leaders and saw other major departures. ""The company has not received parent's consent for changes in the conduct of its business, including for the specific changes listed above,"" Musk said in the letter, calling it a ""material breach"" of the merger deal.
Twitter said it provided Musk, co-founder of electric-car maker Tesla Inc., with ""the full 'firehose' data set that he has been mining for weeks,"" handing the billionaire ""granular monthly reporting identifying each of the sampled accounts by 'user id' and the determination as to whether the account was false or spam, along with the calculations supporting Twitter's estimates, going back to January 1, 2021.""
The company called Musk's stated reasons for withdrawing ""a model of bad faith.""
Twitter said that in Musk's termination notice, he claimed the company withheld information that ""does not exist, has already been provided, or is the subject of requests only made recently,"" the suit said. ""All of this information sweeps far beyond what is reasonably necessary to close the merger.""
It added that Musk's unsolicited offer was accompanied by a threat: ""My offer is my best and final offer and if it is not accepted, I would need to reconsider my position as a shareholder,"" he told the company in an April 13 letter, according to the suit.
After Twitter filed its suit Tuesday, Musk tweeted, ""Oh the irony lol.""
Musk's deal with Twitter had included a provision that if it fell apart, the party breaking the agreement would pay a termination fee of $1 billion, under certain circumstances. Legal experts have debated whether the conflict over spam bots is enough to allow Musk to walk away from the deal.
But the merger agreement also includes a specific performance provision that allows Twitter to force Musk to consummate the deal. Twitter must prove that it didn't violate the buyout agreement's terms and that Musk breached the pact by pulling out. The company hired merger law heavyweight Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz to represent it in the fight.
Musk ""is the underdog in court,"" Matthew Schettenhelm, a litigation analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note before the suit was filed. ""While Musk didn't get all the data he sought, he will still struggle to prove a material breach.""
Twitter told staff in a memo that it has asked for the case to be heard on an expedited basis, in September.
""This repudiation follows a long list of material contractual breaches by Musk that have cast a pall over Twitter and its business,"" the lawsuit said. ""Twitter brings this action to enjoin Musk from further breaches, to compel Musk to fulfill his legal obligations, and to compel consummation of the merger upon satisfaction of the few outstanding conditions.""
Twitter pointed to an estimated $100-billion decline in Musk's personal wealth from Tesla's peak in November 2021, saying: ""Musk wants out."" The company accused him of trying to have Twitter's shareholders ""bear the cost of the market downturn.""
Although he hasn't been sued by the company before, Musk has faced several Twitter-related legal challenges in the past, including winning a defamation suit by someone whom he called a ""pedo"" on the platform.
His 2018 ""funding secured"" tweet about taking Tesla private spurred several lawsuits and an inquiry by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In April, he lost a court bid to get out from under terms of the 2018 settlement he agreed to with the SEC, which required review of any Tesla-related tweets.
Delaware is home to a court system that is well-versed in business battles. In recent years, the Chancery Court has ruled on failed mergers including insurers Anthem Inc. and Cigna Corp., retailer LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and jeweler Tiffany & Co.
This year, Musk won a suit filed in Delaware by investors who claimed that Tesla's buyout of SolarCity was improper.
Twitter shares lost 12% of their value in the first trading day after Musk announced he was walking away from the deal. The stock is down 21% from the start of the year, after closing at $34.06 on Tuesday.
""Musk refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests,"" Twitter said in the suit.

297,13-Jul-22,Telegraph - Herald,Twitter sues to force Musk to complete deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2688748161/BFD812D457A14912PQ/522?accountid=13946,"BY MATT O'BRIEN
The Associated Press
Twitter sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday to force him to complete the $44 billion acquisition of the social media company.
Musk and Twitter have been bracing for a legal fight since the billionaire said Friday he was backing off of his April agreement to buy the company.
Twitter's lawsuit opens with a sharply-worded accusation: ""Musk refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests.""
""Having mounted a public spectacle to put Twitter in play, and having proposed and then signed a seller-friendly merger agreement, Musk apparently believes that he - unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law - is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away,"" the suit says.
Twitter filed its lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery, which frequently handles business disputes among the many corporations, including Twitter, that are incorporated there.
Musk alleged Friday that Twitter has failed to provide enough information about the number of fake accounts on its service. Twitter said last month that it was making available to Musk a ""fire hose"" of raw data on hundreds of millions of daily tweets.
The company has said for years in regulatory filings that it believes about 5% of the accounts on the platform are fake. Musk is also alleging that Twitter broke the acquisition agreement when it fired two top managers and laid off a third of its talent-acquisition team.
When Musk offered to buy the company and take it private in mid-April, the board initially tried to block him by deploying a financial maneuver that would have made the acquisition prohibitively expensive.
By April 25, though, Twitter had reconsidered the offer, concluding that selling the company to Musk for $54.20 a share was in the best interest of shareholders. In a joint press release, Musk pledged to ""unlock"" the social media company's potential by loosening restrictions on speech and rooting out fake accounts.
But his confidence didn't last long. Tesla's stock - Musk's primary source of wealth - plummeted amid a broader stock market selloff in May, and Musk soon seemed less enthusiastic about owning Twitter.
Twitter's suit calls Musk's tactics ""a model of hypocrisy,"" noting that he had emphasized plans to take Twitter private in order to rid it of spam accounts. Once the market declined, however, Twitter noted that ""Musk shifted his narrative, suddenly demanding 'verification' that spam was not a serious problem on Twitter's platform, and claiming a burning need to conduct 'diligence' he had expressly forsworn.""
Similarly, the company charges that Musk operated in bad faith, accusing him of requesting company information in order to accuse Twitter of providing ""misrepresentations"" about its business to regulators and investors.
Musk ""has been acting against this deal since the market started turning, and has breached the merger agreement repeatedly in the process,"" the suit charges.
Twitter's lawsuit alleges that the company ""has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm"" as a result of Musk's contractual breaches that ""cast a pall over Twitter and its business."""
298,13-Jul-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Twitter Suit Would Force Musk to Stay With Deal: [Business/Financial Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2688322341/BFD812D457A14912PQ/558?accountid=13946,"The question of whether Elon Musk must buy Twitter, as he agreed to do in April, is headed to a court in Delaware.SAN FRANCISCO -- Twitter sued Elon Musk on Tuesday to force the billionaire to complete his $44 billion acquisition of the company, setting the stage for a prolonged legal battle over the fate of the social media service.Mr. Musk agreed in April to buy Twitter but declared last week that he intended to walk away from the deal. To push Mr. Musk to abide by the acquisition agreement, Twitter sued him in Chancery Court in Delaware. The court will determine whether he remains on the hook for the purchase or whether Twitter violated its obligation to provide Mr. Musk with data he requested, entitling him to walk away.""Musk refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests,"" the company said in the suit. ""Musk apparently believes that he -- unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law -- is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away.""At the heart of the case is the issue of disclosure. To terminate the deal, Mr. Musk claimed that Twitter balked at handing over information about spam bots, also known as fake accounts, on the platform. He repeatedly said he did not believe the company's public statements that roughly 5 percent of its active users are bots. Twitter intentionally misled the public, he said, and obstructed his efforts to get more information about how it accounts for the figures. Mr. Musk has also taken aim at Twitter for not giving warning before recently firing two key executives.But Mr. Musk signed a legally binding agreement with Twitter. And in that contract, Twitter included a specific performance clause that allows it to sue to force the deal through, so long as the debt that the billionaire has corralled for the acquisition is in place.In a letter to Mr. Musk's lawyers on Sunday, Twitter's lawyers said that his move to terminate the deal was ""invalid and wrongful"" and that Mr. Musk ""knowingly, intentionally, willfully and materially breached"" his agreement to buy the firm. The company has said that it is confident in its figures about spam accounts, and that it uses experts in spam to audit the count and ensure its accuracy.In its suit, Twitter argued that Mr. Musk, who also leads the automaker Tesla, wanted to exit the deal because of changes in the stock market that affected his wealth. (Tesla's stock has fallen in recent months.) Twitter said the billionaire used his complaints about bots as a pretext to wriggle out of the agreement.Mr. Musk also broke an agreement not to publicly insult Twitter executives and he ""covertly abandoned"" his efforts to secure debt funding for the deal, the lawsuit said. In doing so, the social media company said he breached his obligations to use ""reasonable best efforts"" to get a deal done.""Musk wanted an escape,"" the company said. ""But the merger agreement left him little room.""Mr. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.Sean Edgett, Twitter's general counsel, informed employees of the suit in an internal memo on Tuesday and said the company had also ""filed a motion for an expedited trial alongside the complaint, asking for the case to be heard in September, as it is critically important for this matter to be resolved quickly.""Twitter's chief executive, Parag Agrawal, wrote in response, ""We took this opportunity to tell our story and defend our company, our people and our stockholders,"" adding: ""We plan to hold the buyer fully accountable to fulfill his contractual obligations. We will prove our position in court, and we believe we will prevail."" The New York Times obtained both memos.Twitter is seeking a four-day trial this September. The deal has a deadline of Oct. 24 to be completed. Should the transaction still be awaiting regulatory approval at that time, Mr. Musk and Twitter would have another six months to close it.Brian J.M. Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, said Twitter's legal arguments were strong. He noted that Mr. Musk's tweets were peppered throughout the lawsuit, including one that the billionaire sent before signing the deal that showed he was aware of spam on Twitter. Mr. Musk had tweeted, ""we will defeat the spam bots or die trying.""""His lawyers are going to be very unhappy with the fact that he tweets,"" Mr. Quinn said of Mr. Musk. ""All the tweets that they can find, they are using against him.""Still, Mr. Musk's threat of walking away could bring Twitter back to the negotiating table, allowing the billionaire to buy the company at a discount. The two sides could also settle with Mr. Musk paying damages to Twitter. Or he could pay a $1 billion breakup fee and walk away, an option allowed only under certain circumstances, such as if Mr. Musk's financing fell through.If Mr. Musk successfully disentangles himself from Twitter, it could be disastrous for the company. Its stock has fallen more than 35 percent below his offer of $54.20 per share. Twitter's business has also deteriorated in recent months. In May, Mr. Agrawal said in a memo to employees that the company had not lived up to its business and financial goals.Now that Twitter has sued, Mr. Musk and his lawyers are expected to respond. While the timeline beyond then depends on many factors, the company and Mr. Musk will most likely be called to a hearing in Delaware and go through the discovery process, with the two sides digging up facts they believe are relevant to the case.The case may then move to a trial, though there is a chance the judge assigned to the case will dismiss Mr. Musk's efforts to walk away. If the suit proceeds to trial, the judge will decide whether Twitter's disclosures were insufficient and constituted a material harm to the deal.In the past, Delaware's Chancery Court has prevented companies from trying to walk away from deals. In 2001, for example, when Tyson Foods tried to back out of an acquisition of the meatpacker IBP, the court ruled that Tyson had to follow through with the agreement. In situations where the court has allowed buyers to exit, it has required them to pay damages. By most readings of Twitter's contract with Mr. Musk, damages would be capped at $1 billion.Twitter and Mr. Musk have assembled legal teams to duke it out. Leading Twitter's efforts in Delaware is William Savitt, a lawyer at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz. Wachtell Lipton is famous for, among other things, developing legal tactics to protect companies from hostile buyers, like the so-called poison pill that Twitter originally put in place to defend itself against Mr. Musk.Mr. Savitt has experience before Delaware's Chancery Court and previously defended companies against the likes of Carl Icahn and Pershing Square, the investment firm run by the billionaire William Ackman. But Mr. Musk is unlike any other corporate raider who preceded him, making him a particularly complex opponent.Mr. Musk's legal team includes his personal lawyer, Alex Spiro, plus his partners at the law firm Quinn Emanuel and lawyers from Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. Skadden is a go-to corporate law firm, with ample experience arguing cases in front of the Delaware court, including the attempt by the luxury giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton to break up its $16 billion deal to acquire Tiffany & Company. Skadden's client, LVMH, ultimately shaved about $420 million off its purchase price.Mike Isaac contributed reporting. Jack Begg contributed research.Mike Isaac contributed reporting.

299,13-Jul-22,Barron's (Online),Twitter Sues Elon Musk to Force Him to Honor Deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2688442728/BFD812D457A14912PQ/581?accountid=13946,"As expected, Twitter has asked a Delaware court to force Elon Musk to honor his $44 billion deal to buy the social media company.
 In a filing late Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Musk had disclosed a letter from his attorney declaring his intention to terminate the transaction. Musk's lawyer asserted that Twitter (ticker: TWTR) had materially breached the acquisition agreement by declining to provide full information about fake accounts on the service.
The letter, signed by Skadden, Arps, Slate Meagher & Flom attorney Mike Ringler, asserted that ""Twitter has failed or refused to provide this information. Sometimes Twitter has ignored Mr. Musk's requests, sometimes it has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified, and sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving Mr. Musk incomplete or unusable information.""
In response to Musk's filing, Twitter on Friday vowed to file suit to enforce the terms of the transaction. And the company now has fulfilled that promise, filing an action in Delaware Chancery Court which seeks to compel Musk to proceed with his $54.20 a share cash offer to acquire the company.
In its filing to the court on Tuesday, Twitter asserted that Musk had no valid reason to terminate his offer.
""Musk refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests,"" Twitter said in the court filing. ""Having mounted a public spectacle to put Twitter in play, and having proposed and then signed a seller-friendly merger agreement, Musk apparently believes that he—unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law—is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away. This repudiation follows a long list of material contractual breaches by Musk that have cast a pall over Twitter and its business.""
Musk himself had pledged $33.5 billion of his own money to back the deal, which had no financing contingency and no due diligence condition. Twitter noted in the filing that Musk had originally presented his offer on a take-it-or-leave it basis.
""Twitter brings this action to enjoin Musk from further breaches, to compel Musk to fulfill his legal obligations, and to compel consummation of the merger upon satisfaction of the few outstanding conditions,"" the filing said.
In the lawsuit, Twitter asserts that Musk now ""wants out,"" largely due to the sharp decline in the stock market, which has reduced the value of both other social media stocks and Musk's stake in the automaker Tesla (TSLA).
""Rather than bear the cost of the market downturn, as the merger agreement requires, Musk wants to shift it to Twitter's stockholders,"" the company said. ""Since signing the merger agreement, Musk has repeatedly disparaged Twitter and the deal, creating business risk for Twitter and downward pressure on its share price.""
The company also said that Musk's assertion that there is an issue around fake accounts is ""a model of hypocrisy,"" noting that Musk had previously said that one of the reasons he wanted to buy Twitter was to get rid of spam on the site.
In a tweet, Musk responded Tuesday afternoon by simply saying ""oh the irony LOL,"" an apparent reference to Twitter shifting from a reluctant seller to one now attempting to force the sale of the company to Musk.
Twitter is a Delaware company (as are nearly 2 million companies, including most of the Fortune 500). Delaware's Court of Chancery, the 230-year-old institution, has a reputation for being strict about contractual obligations, according to lawyers familiar with the court. It has been center stage for many of the highest profile corporate battles in recent years, including 2020's merger fight between LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co.
Twitter shares were rising 0.8% in premarket trading Wednesday to $34.34.

This transcript was automatically generated, and then edited for clarity in its current form. There may be some differences between the audio and the text. Taylor Wilson: Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Wednesday, the 13th of July, 2022. Today, a terrifying look inside Uvalde's Robb Elementary School. Plus, more from the Elon Musk and Twitter saga, and more. Here are some of the top headlines: The House January 6th Committee heard testimony yesterday from rioters who say they participated in the Capitol attack, following calls of former President Donald Trump. One apologized to officers at the hearing. President Joe Biden will begin his first presidential trip to the Middle East today, starting in Israel. He then heads to Saudi Arabia on Friday. And a judge in Baton Rouge, Louisiana has temporarily blocked the state's trigger law outlawing abortion. The move pauses the total ban on the medical procedure and opens the door for Louisiana's three abortion clinics to reopen. ♦ The public has gotten its first glimpse at security camera footage inside Uvalde's Robb Elementary School as a gunman entered the building and as police lagged in the response. A warning, some of the following details are graphic and disturbing. In the video, the gunman can be seen walking into the school moments after spraying bullets outside the building. He slows down to peek around a corner in a hallway before heading toward classrooms 111 and 112. Seconds later, a boy exits a bathroom to return to his class. As the kid turns a corner, he notices the gunman standing outside the classroom door and unloading a barrage of bullets. That boy then turns and runs back into the bathroom. He was later rescued by police. The gunman enters one of the classrooms and children are heard screaming. Gunfire continues on and off and nearly three minutes later, three police officers arrive in the hallway. They rush toward the classrooms before a burst of gunfire and they then retreat. Eventually dozens of heavily armed officers gather in the school hallway. They would not rush in though and kill the gunman until an hour and 14 minutes after police first arrived on the scene. The video's release has been controversial. Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin supported its release while Uvalde County District Attorney Christina Mitchell Busby opposed it. Texas Department of Public Safety Director, Steven McCraw said the incident commander, School District Police Chief Pete Arredondo treated the situation as a barricaded subject instead of an active shooter situation. ♦ The saga between Elon Musk and Twitter continues. The two are getting ready to head into a court battle over the sale of the company to the Tesla CEO. Money and Tech reporter, Terry Collins has the latest. Terry Collins: So on Tuesday, Twitter filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk, claiming that the billionaire backed out of a $44 billion agreement to buy the embattled social media company. As you know, Musk agreed to buy Twitter in April, but he filed papers on Friday with the SEC wanting to walk away from the acquisition agreement. Now we have a Delaware court that could determine whether he has to buy the company that's seen both his stock and reputation plummet. Twitter said that Musk signed that agreement to a deal and he just can't simply avoid it or abandon it. They say that he refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and their stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interest. To that end, Musk, in classic fashion, responded to Twitter's lawsuit with a tweet that said quote, ""Oh, the irony. LOL."" The board has given their blessing that they want the deal. Certain investors and stockholders said they want the deal. So because it was Musk and they thought Musk on the surface had a genuine interest in buying the company. But now he wants to walk away. But there are many, maybe including like myself, that thinks that this is all going to lead to something maybe with the deal, maybe a lower price deal or restructured, some sort of negotiated deal. I don't think we're quite done with this because a part of me and also others think that, ""Well, if this were to happen, wasn't there a way that Musk could just do a buyout deal?"" But I don't know if that's going to happen. I think this, now we're going to be in this quote, legal limbo, as Wedbush analyst, Dan Ives said. I think we're going to see some negotiations, some jabbing, some snark and a lot of other things while the parties, maybe in some way keep the lines of communication open and maybe try to find and come to some sort of deal. So Wedbush analyst, Dan Ives told me that many are bracing for a fight as Wall Street views Twitter as having the upper hand. He thinks that Twitter's not holding back any punches and they're coming out swinging after months of turmoil and fiasco. This now starts what's going to be an ugly and lengthy legal battle. And after this suit, he said he would bet that Twitter and Musk may not be doing any champagne dinners. Taylor Wilson: For Terry's full story, check out a link in today's episode description. ♦ The city of Akron, Ohio has declared today a day of mourning for Jayland Walker. Police shot and killed the unarmed Black man on June 27th as he fled police who were pursuing him for a traffic and equipment violation according to authorities. Akron City Council passed a resolution earlier this week declaring the day of mourning, while protesters continue to gather outside city hall. [Audio from protest] Protesters want reform, but police in the city have said they will continue with their current traffic stop and chase policies. ♦ Do you ever wonder if TikTok or Instagram are reading your mind? Money reporter Bailey Schulz explains why it's so hard to avoid those impulse purchases on social media that seem to pop up right when you're thinking about them. Bailey Schulz: Yeah, so what we're seeing from market research firm, eMarketer, they forecast that US social media shopping will jump 25% to $45.7 billion this year. And that means more than half of the country's adults are making purchases directly on platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, things like that. So it seems like we are seeing a rise in this form of shopping. From what I have heard from experts, these apps are kind of a perfect combination of just being able to put in front of you what you might want to buy, where these algorithms can be very strong and really nail down your personality, your likes, what might interest you. And so when you are constantly presented with items that are something that you would likely buy, that means that you have a better chance of perhaps buying more of those items. I did talk to a couple of experts as well about just what the financial risks are of being on platforms like this and shopping on social media. And while it can take a dent to your savings, or perhaps if you're already in debt, so it could make things worse. So it's something to watch out for. But on the other hand, a lot of times these sort of quick impulse purchases are smaller items, costs maybe not that much money. And so it really depends who is doing the shopping, how much they're spending. There's just a lot of ways that it could look. So really hard to say just how much of a financial risk this is. It really depends on the person and what they're doing. ♦ Taylor Wilson: The biggest supermoon of the year is set to rise tonight in the Southeastern sky. July's full moon will reach peak illumination at 2:38 PM Eastern time, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. At that time, it'll be below the horizon still so the Almanac advises to look toward the Southeast after sunset to watch it rise into the sky. When the Earth's orbit brings it closer to the moon than usual, it's referred to as a supermoon, making the moon appear brighter and bigger than normal. In addition to being a supermoon, July's moon is also referred to as a buck moon because the antlers of male deer are in full growth mode at this time. And it's called the thunder moon because of summer thunderstorms. Thanks for listening to 5 Things. You can find us seven mornings a week right here wherever you're listening right now.

301,14-Jul-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Twitter Lawsuit Adds to Musk's Tesla and SpaceX Challenges; Billionaire's businesses have a history of setbacks, followed by strong recoveries that have helped make him the world's richest man",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2688921873/BFD812D457A14912PQ/183?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk built his reputation and fortune juggling diverse businesses —a skill that is being tested like rarely before as he seeks to abandon his deal for Twitter Inc., while confronting challenges at Tesla Inc. and his rocket company SpaceX.
 Twitter on Tuesday sued Mr. Musk in Delaware Chancery Court to force him to follow through on the $44 billion takeover he agreed to in April and last week said he wanted to walk away from . It sets the stage for a high-profile legal battle that could drag on for months or longer. Prior lawsuits have led to depositions of Mr. Musk and saw him take the stand.
Tesla and SpaceX didn't respond to requests for comment.
Tesla, still the world's most valuable auto maker by far, earlier this month reported its first sequential decline in quarterly deliveries in more than two years, largely reflecting supply-chain disruptions and an extended factory shutdown in China because of Covid-19-related lockdowns there.
Mr. Musk also recently described the company's new plants in Germany and Texas as ""gigantic money furnaces."" The factories opened earlier this year, but the company has struggled to increase production at both, Mr. Musk said.
""Berlin and Austin are losing billions of dollars right now because there's a ton of expense and hardly any output,"" he said in a late May interview with a Tesla owners' club. Mr. Musk, who has been expressing concerns about the global economy, initiated a round of job cuts at the car maker last month.
Tesla's production challenges, some of which have been largely out of the company's control, threaten to waste a ""golden opportunity"" to get electric vehicles to market ahead of rivals, said Gene Munster, a managing partner at research and investment firm Loup Ventures.
""You just can't give oxygen to your competitors,"" said Mr. Munster, a longtime Tesla watcher whose firm doesn't hold the company's stock.
On Wednesday, Andrej Karpathy, a longtime executive who played a key role in developing Tesla's advanced driver-assistance system known as Autopilot, said he was leaving the company . Mr. Musk, on Twitter, thanked Mr. Karpathy for his contributions.
Last year, Mr. Musk warned that if a severe global recession dried up capital availability and liquidity while SpaceX was losing billions on its Starship rocket program and its satellite-broadband service, bankruptcy wasn't impossible . The space company was the busiest U.S. rocket-launch provider last year, handling both human flights and satellite missions.
The entrepreneur said he visited a company launch site in Texas after a fiery explosion on Monday under one of the company's Super Heavy boosters. Those towering vehicles underpin the Starship rocket system, which Mr. Musk has said Space Exploration Technologies Corp., as the company is formally known, plans to use for its most ambitious missions, including a prospective human voyage to Mars.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is also counting on a version of Starship to ferry astronauts to the surface of the moon as soon as 2025.
""Yeah, actually not good,"" Mr. Musk wrote on Twitter in response to the explosion, saying a SpaceX team was assessing the damage. He added that the booster's base appeared sound, though SpaceX shut down the launchpad for safety reasons. Later, he tweeted: ""Damage appears to be minor, but we need to inspect all the engines.""
Jeffrey Hoffman, an aerospace engineering professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and former astronaut, said SpaceX faces significant hurdles developing Starship, including showing that the engines clustered under its Super Heavy boosters are able to function as designed. ""The parallel operation of 33 rocket engines at the same time is a big deal,"" he said, referring to the design.
SpaceX, alongside other satellite companies, is also embroiled in a regulatory battle against Dish Network Corp. and others as the Federal Communications Commission mulls new rules for the radio frequencies used to carry its signals.
Soaring inflation is weighing on both Tesla and SpaceX , Mr. Musk has said. Some Tesla suppliers are requesting 20% to 30% more for parts than they did last year, Mr. Musk said in April, when the company reported record quarterly profit.
Meanwhile, some SpaceX employees signed a letter raising concerns and frustration over the CEO's recent public statements and behavior, describing them as a source of embarrassment and distraction. The company fired at least some of the staffers involved in the effort. Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX's president, said the letter distracted employees and upset many of them.
Mr. Musk is also a founder of Boring Co., a tunneling enterprise, and Neuralink Corp., a neuroscience startup working on brain-implant technologies. He has at times bemoaned the workload he has heaped on himself. ""It would be nice to have a bit more free time on my hands, as opposed to just working day and night from when I wake up till when I go to sleep seven days a week. It's pretty intense,"" he said last year during a Tesla analyst briefing.
Deep business challenges at Tesla and SpaceX are nothing new for Mr. Musk. The auto maker nearly went bust in 2018, Mr. Musk has said, as it struggled to increase production of its Model 3 sedan, the car that helped turn Tesla from a niche player to a mass market auto producer. Mr. Musk at one point slept on the factory floor of what was then the company's lone U.S. car plant, in Fremont, Calif., to work through what he called ""production hell."" 
 PHOTOS: How Elon Musk Made His Fortune 
Once those problems were overcome, Tesla's stock began its meteoric rise that helped turn Mr. Musk into the world's richest man and padded the company's coffers. Tesla was sitting on around $17.5 billion in cash as of the first quarter.
Closely held SpaceX has dealt with setbacks in its business before. For instance, one of the company's Falcon 9 rockets exploded during a test in 2016 , destroying a Facebook satellite. At the time, it was the second catastrophic failure of such a launcher in 15 months. The company made adjustments and recovered. Four years later, it launched two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station, or ISS, the first launch of humans into orbit from U.S. soil since the agency's last shuttle mission in 2011.
Mr. Musk's businesses have notched notable successes in recent months. In addition to its record profits earlier in the year, Tesla reported its highest-ever vehicle production in June, with output at the Shanghai plant recovering. That month, NASA said it intended to hire SpaceX to handle five additional crewed flights to the ISS, a plan that would add to the nine flights the agency had already acquired under a contract valued at about $3.5 billion.
SpaceX also regularly blasts satellites to orbit for commercial customers and U.S. spy agencies, while Starlink, its satellite-internet business, recently won regulatory approval to provide service to planes, boats and recreational vehicles.
Tesla's share price has fallen more than 40% from its November high, but the company's roughly $737 billion valuation as of Wednesday was still higher than the next eight auto makers combined. SpaceX's valuation this year reached around $125 billion after it raised more than $1.7 billion, topping that of more established aerospace powerhouses Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp.

 Twitter Lawsuit Adds to Musk's Tesla and SpaceX Challenges

302,14-Jul-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk: 'Lithium Batteries Are the New Oil',https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2689283665/BFD812D457A14912PQ/405?accountid=13946,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk defined energy independence for an electric-vehicle world. You have to have the batteries .
Responding to a tweet Wednesday which said there is no security without energy independence, Tesla's (ticker: TSLA) CEO agreed , adding ""and lithium batteries are the new oil.""
Batteries might be the future. For now, oil is still the new oil. The U.S. uses about 20 million barrels of oil used in the U.S. each day. (About 8 million barrels are imported.) And about two thirds of that oil ends up in gas tanks, according to the Energy Department .
Prices for gasoline are soaring, partly as a consequence of the war between Russia and Ukraine—something well beyond the control of most Americans or American corporations.
Consumers and businesses feel the pain of higher prices, though. The U.S. consumer price index rose 9.1% year over year in June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics . Gasoline prices are a big part of overall inflation. They are up about 63% year over year.
High oil prices are one reason interest in electric vehicles is higher. The AAA reported Wednesday that 25% of new car buyers surveyed are considering an EV for their next car. High gas prices were cited as the biggest reason consumers are considering the switch.
But like Musk points out, EVs don't completely solve the problem of energy independence. It trades the oil problem for a lithium-ion battery problem.
OPEC nations don't produce many lithium-ion batteries. Production is dominated by Asia. China's Contemporary Amperex Technology (300750.China), better known as CATL, makes about 30% of the world's EV batteries, according to Ford Motor (F) CEO Jim Farley.
CATL has grown into a huge company. Its $200 billion market-capitalization rivals Toyota Motor (TM). Toyota, as well as Farley and Musk along with other auto executives, are working to take some of that market share. Traditional auto companies have announced billions in spending to build battery plants in the U.S.
Traditional battery companies are coming to America, too. Japanese tech firm Panasonic (6752.Japan) announced Wednesday evening a plan for battery capacity in Kansas which will create about 4,000 jobs. The exact size of the plant wasn't included in the news release. Panasonic didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. But that many employees could likely produce enough batteries to make 800,000 or 1 million EVs annually.
Most auto makers, including General Motors (GM) and Ford, believe roughly 50% of new car sales will be battery electric by 2030. That could mean up to 10 million EVs a year in the U.S. alone.
That production requires, perhaps, 800 gigawatt hours of battery-making capacity. That's about 80% of global battery capacity in 2021.
Making batteries in the U.S. is part of the lithium-ion battery independence equation. The materials that go into batteries is another factor. Lithium is mined, mainly, in South America and Australia. The lithium is processed largely in China.
Auto makers are all in on battery capacity. Other materials, such as nickel and cobalt come from many other countries. Car companies, including Tesla, might consider investing further up the battery value chain to insulate themselves from commodity-price shocks like the one that U.S. drivers are experiencing in 2022.
A basket of metals that go into lithium ion batteries is up about 45% year to date, adding roughly $1,500 to the price of atypical EV.
If Musk is right about batteries, then investing in all parts of the battery value chain, along with building battery capacity, looks to be the smartest strategy to build a competitive advantage in EVs.

304,15-Jul-22,Los Angeles Times,BUSINESS; A court is in driver's seat for Musk's battle with Twitter,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2689452304/BFD812D457A14912PQ/429?accountid=13946,"Most nonlawyers probably have no idea that the Delaware Chancery Court even exists. Thanks to Elon Musk and Twitter, it's about to become world famous.
The Delaware court is the principal forum for legal disputes involving public corporations in the U.S. That's because most corporations take advantage of the state's corporation-friendly laws and procedures by incorporating in Delaware, which gives the Chancery Court jurisdiction over a huge universe of business disputes.
If you're a corporate lawyer, you better have the court's procedures and precedents at your fingertips. If you're anyone else, its rulings on contract law are snooze-inducing.

That's about to change because both Twitter and Tesla, the shares of which constitute the bulk of Musk's wealth, are incorporated in Delaware.
You'll be hearing a lot in coming weeks and months about Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick, in effect the court's chief judge, who has assigned herself the Musk/Twitter dispute.
Many experts say the case will present a challenge for the court for several reasons.
One is that Twitter is an unusually large company to be a party in a busted merger agreement. Another is Musk's habit of thumbing his nose at governmental authority. As the nation's principal arbiter of business law, the Chancery Court can't afford to allow its orders to be flouted.
Before we go further into the court's options, let's examine the background of this legal maelstrom.
As we've reported, Musk signed an agreement in April to acquire Twitter at $54.20 per share, or $44 billion, and take the social media platform private.
After that, the stock market suffered a strong downturn that slashed the value of Tesla shares, some of which Musk had pledged to finance the deal. The value of Twitter also fell sharply, making his $54.20 offer look ridiculously excessive.
Musk started ginning up transparently bogus excuses to place the deal ""on hold,"" even though the merger agreement gave him no such option.
On July 8, Musk formally pulled out of the deal, asserting (without evidence) that Twitter had misled him about the state of its business.
Twitter promptly filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court, asking that it enforce a clause in the merger deal calling for ""specific performance"" -- that is, that Musk be required to follow through on the deal's original terms.
Many legal experts believe that Twitter has a strong case. ""If the case goes all the way through trial and appeal, I think Twitter will prevail in the judicial system,"" says Stephen M. Bainbridge, corporate law professor at UCLA.
The merger agreement not only identified specific performance as a remedy for a contract breach, but it also states that neither Musk nor Twitter can challenge the appropriateness of specific performance in court. In other words, even if Musk believes that being forced to buy Twitter would be inappropriate or unfair, he can't bring that argument before the Chancery Court.
So what are the court's options? Legal professionals say there are three.
One is to allow Musk out of the deal for $1 billion, a fee written into the merger agreement if either side withdraws for any of a limited set of reasons. None of those appear to be relevant to this merger.
In any case, given the damage that Musk has allegedly done to Twitter by his on-again-off-again dalliance with its purchase, $1 billion looks like a pitifully small assessment.
A second is for the court to find some grounds to issue a judgment somewhere between $1 billion and $44 billion. Given the difficulty of finding the proper number, however, that may not be a choice the Chancery Court wishes to make.
The third option is to order Musk to buy Twitter on ""specific performance"" grounds.
The Chancery Court has not been shy about issuing such orders on numerous occasions where the provision is explicitly contemplated in a merger agreement negotiated by sophisticated parties represented by sophisticated lawyers, as is the case here.
It's true that the court has some flexibility about ordering a merger to go through when one party balks. In an oft-cited 2006 case, the court observed that ""when balancing the equities '[we] must be convinced that specific enforcement of a validly formed contract would [not] cause even greater harm than it would prevent.' ""
The court has never actually exercised that option, business law experts say.
It's possible that this may be such a case. The court may need to consider ""the appropriateness of requiring a merger against an unwilling buyer for a company this size and this kind of social footprint,"" Ann Lipton, a business law expert at Tulane University, said during a panel discussion hosted by UC Berkeley's law school Wednesday.
On the other side of the argument is the Chancery Court's interest in upholding its own reputation. Legal and business authorities have been debating online what might happen if Musk simply refuses to comply with a court order either to complete the acquisition of Twitter or pay a steep price to abandon the deal. It's unlikely that the court would allow him to do so.
""The notion that Musk can somehow lose in Chancery Court and refuse to go forward strikes me as absurd,"" Bainbridge says. ""The hallmark of Delaware law is that they provide predictability and certainty.... If Delaware says, 'We're going to make an Elon Musk exception,' the damage to Delaware's brand would be enormous.""
Chancellor McCormick, moreover, is known as a tough judge. ""She's not somebody to be trifled with,"" Bainbridge says. ""She's not somebody intimidated by wealth or power.""
If Musk is slapped with an unfavorable judgment -- either an order that he complete the acquisition or pay significantly more than $1 billion in damages, he will be under tremendous pressure to comply.
Some of that pressure will come from his lawyers. ""His professionals' reputations will be on the line,"" David Hoffman, a contract law expert at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, told me. ""The lawyers know that if they have a noncompliant client in Delaware, where they have to appear as litigators, there's risk for them.""
Second, Delaware law allows it to essentially take control of Musk's assets -- chiefly Tesla shares -- and to satisfy the judgment by ""selling them on the auction block,"" Hoffman says. The court could appoint a receiver with the authority to sell the shares, if necessary.
Then there's the basic reality that Tesla, as a Delaware company, is subject to Delaware courts' authority in myriad ways. ""I don't think as a practical matter you can be the head of a public company incorporated in Delaware and be constantly in contempt of the Delaware courts,"" Lipton said in the Berkeley webcast.
The most likely outcome may be one in which the Chancery Court forces Musk and Twitter to the negotiating table.
""The best outcome for a court always is settlement,"" Hoffman says. ""I expect the chancellor to signal very aggressively, if she's convinced that Musk breached his contract, that she's intending to grant specific performance in hope or expectation that the parties settle.""
Bainbridge agrees. ""The sensible thing for everybody to do, if we were dealing with ordinary folks,"" he says, ""would be for everybody to sit down and work out a deal that either increases the break-up fee or is some face-saving solution where Musk doesn't end up owning Twitter, but Twitter gets to take a pretty good chunk out of Musk's hide.""

305,15-Jul-22,The Washington Post,Why are Musk and Trump feuding? They're the same.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2689409391/BFD812D457A14912PQ/541?accountid=13946,"If you should take Donald Trump seriously but not literally, how should you take Elon Musk?
The richest man in the world and the man who'd like you to think he's the richest man in the world have engaged in recent days in a public spat. The tussle comes at what seems like a surprising time. After all, these past few months have been a study in how much these men have in common.
The SpaceX and Tesla CEO tweeted on Monday that the former president should ""hang up his hat & sail into the sunset"" - though, he assured us, he doesn't hate the guy. Trump later replied on his proprietary social media site with a photo of him and Musk smiling together in the Oval Office, during friendlier days. When the entrepreneur came to him asking for money for projects including ""rocketships to nowhere,"" he wrote, ""I could have said 'drop to your knees and beg,' and he would have done it.""
Ouch. To be fair to Musk, Trump started it, by referring to his now-foe at a rally as ""another bull---t artist.""
If it takes one to know one, the inventor of Trump Steaks knows best of all.
Musk has, to his credit, actually built things other than skyscrapers with his name on them. His rocketships are not going nowhere; they have gone already to the International Space Station, they will go soon to the moon and they might go someday to Mars. His cars don't really drive themselves yet, but they do drive - without using any gas.
There has always been a touch of bluster to Musk's business: Yeah, right, you've managed to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence to cure paralysis. Yet, generally, he has not only dreamed big but also spent his waking hours making stuff happen.
Except, that is, for the hours he spends playing provocateur on Twitter.
This is where the similarities begin. Trump is exiled from the platform now, but that's precisely because by the end of his time there, he was too much of a power user - or a power abuser. His favorite activity besides issuing presidential proclamations in fewer than 280 characters was name-calling: ""low-lifes,"" ""dopes,"" ""dogs,"" ""drunk/drugged-up losers.""
Musk replaces the boomer sensibility Trump brought to the service with the spirit of a red-pilled, 4chan-addled teenager. He likes memes that don't look as though your deranged uncle made them on Microsoft Paint, and he has keen knowledge of the art of the troll.
Yet the impulse to demean, and to summon tens of millions of frenzied followers to add injury to his every insult, mirrors the onetime commander in chief's instinct. ""Pedo guy,"" Musk once called a cave diver who helped rescue a trapped team of young soccer players in Thailand. And Musk, too, makes real-world mischief with his online missives. Remember when he said he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share, and with those words (and weed joke) moved markets?
These Trumpian tendencies have always been present in Musk, but they've reached their apotheosis this year. His self-documented rightward drift isn't even the point, though that is something else he shares with the flip-flopping non-ideologue who now has the GOP in thrall. The point is his attempt to purchase Twitter. Or, now, his attempt not to purchase it.
This effort not merely to stand at the center of what he calls the country's town square but to dominate it smacks of the MAGA cause. After all, at its heart is the view that Twitter is broken and that he alone can fix it.
This was the case at the start, when he actually wanted to take over the company: Everything the platform did to improve safety, or prevent exploitation, or root out hate and harassment, Musk repackaged as an affront to free speech. And it's even more the case now, when he wants to wriggle out of taking over the company: Twitter, he insists, is swarming with artificial accounts to an extent that should free him from his commitment. (Not that he couldn't solve that problem, too, if he wanted.)
Maybe Musk really believes that liberal bias has squelched expression on a service central to the national discourse, or that Twitter is so bot- ridden that real conversations can't occur. Maybe he's being disingenuous - spinning his own big lie, or a bunch of small lies put together. The result, in any case, is the same.
Elon Musk said he hoped to acquire Twitter because Twitter is a mess, just like Donald Trump hoped to acquire America because America was a mess. And, at the same time, Musk has made Twitter much, much messier: treating distrust as fuel for his campaign to lead Twitter or, depending on the day, to lose it.
No wonder Musk doesn't hate the guy. He is the guy. And if you're wondering why two people so similar to each other have plunged into so nasty a fight, you're not asking a question - you're answering it.

306,15-Jul-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk Fires Back at Twitter Lawsuit; Billionaire opposes Twitter's request for expedited trial over stalled deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2689795861/BFD812D457A14912PQ/557?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk filed a motion Friday opposing Twitter Inc.'s request to expedite a trial over his intention to terminate his $44 billion takeover.
 Lawyers for Mr. Musk filed papers with the Delaware Chancery Court, their first public response to the lawsuit filed earlier this week by the social-media company seeking to enforce the terms of their merger agreement. The court should reject Twitter's ""unjustifiable request to rush this,"" they said in their filing.
Twitter has asked the court to expedite the proceedings, citing risks from the recent economic downturn and being held in limbo by a buyer. The company requested a trial by mid-September ""to protect Twitter and its stockholders from the continuing market risk and operational harm resulting from Musk's attempt to bully his way out of an airtight merger agreement.""
Mr. Musk moved to terminate the acquisition last week, saying the company hadn't provided the necessary data and information he needed to assess the prevalence of fake or spam accounts and was ""in material breach of multiple provisions"" of the merger agreement.
Twitter has rejected that assertion and argued that Mr. Musk hasn't adhered to the terms, including violating a nondisclosure agreement and then bragging about it on Twitter.
In Friday's filing, Mr. Musk's lawyers said: ""The core dispute over false and spam accounts is fundamental to Twitter's value. It is also extremely fact and expert intensive, requiring substantial time for discovery.""
Mr. Musk's lawyers argued that ""it is unnecessary to resolve these weighty considerations on a breakneck schedule"" and asked for a trial date on or after Feb. 13 of next year, adding that the debt financing was valid until April 25, 2023.
Twitter declined to comment.
Mr. Musk has fired criticism at Twitter through a steady stream of tweets over the past several months, and his lawyers have raised specific complaints in several letters that have been made public through securities filings. But Friday's court document is the first time his side has laid out publicly a clear timeline around his concerns over data about fake and spam accounts, and included new claims about Twitter's level of cooperation on the issue.
Mr. Musk's side became concerned about Twitter's user numbers after the company announced revisions in its first quarter earnings in April , when it said it had overstated its user base for nearly three years through the end of 2021 due to an error in how it accounted for people linked to multiple accounts. The revision reduced the number of monetizable daily active users by 0.9% for the fourth quarter of last year.
In a May 6 meeting with Twitter executives about how spam is calculated, Mr. Musk 's team on Friday said he was ""flabbergasted to learn just how meager Twitter's process was,"" and pointed to the absence of automated tools to help with the calculation.
 PHOTOS: How Elon Musk Made the Fortune He'll Need to Buy Twitter 
Twitter has long estimated that fewer than 5% of its monetizable daily active users are spam or fake accounts, a figure Mr. Musk has disputed . In its suit against Mr. Musk, Twitter said the Tesla Inc. CEO's attempt to abandon the transaction reflects souring market conditions that resulted in his personal wealth declining by more than $100 billion from its November 2021 peak. ""Rather than bear the cost of the market downturn, as the merger agreement requires, Musk wants to shift it to Twitter's stockholders,"" the company said.
Twitter had said it had bent over backward to accommodate Mr. Musk's data request, including by giving him access to its so-called fire hose of near real-time tweets as well as historical tweets. His side on Friday countered that the interactions were akin to ""a two-month treasure hunt of delays, technical bottlenecks, evasive answers, and, ultimately, refusals.""
Twitter has said its process for estimating fake and spam accounts on its platform involves multiple human reviews of thousands of accounts sampled at random over time and that it also relies on private user data it doesn't disclose publicly—and hasn't shared with Mr. Musk—such as IP addresses and phone numbers.
Mr. Musk's side also took issue with other elements of the Twitter suit, including the company's assertion that the billionaire had disparaged the business he was planning to buy. ""With the sense of humor of a bot, Twitter claims that Musk is damaging the company with tweets like a Chuck Norris meme and a poop emoji. Twitter ignores that Musk is its second largest shareholder with a far greater economic stake than the entire Twitter board,"" the filing states.

 Elon Musk Fires Back at Twitter Lawsuit

307,16-Jul-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Elon Musk's Narrow Twitter Escape,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2690068821/BFD812D457A14912PQ/278?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk wants out of Twitter for the obvious reason. The deal was becoming a big financial loser for him, even a danger to his entrepreneurial ambitions. Twitter is looking less appealing as a turnaround project. The Tesla shares he would have to sell to complete the purchase are plummeting. The economy is headed into deep waters.
It's not entirely irrelevant that the $8.5 billion he already sold (after Tesla shares had dropped almost $200) now looks like an advantageous trade given Tesla's further decline. Now he's supposed to surrender this highly useful cash to buy Twitter shares on even more disadvantageous terms? No thanks.
His legal case is not strong. Still, he's Elon Musk. He ran circles around the Securities and Exchange Commission and got away with it because of his towering influence with the investing public. This Musk circularity-singularity he may hope will also work with Twitter, its lawyers and the Delaware chancery court. Wowed by his iconic mojo, they will let him off easy on his commitments.
Then again, the rule of law may be annoying but it protects us all. Trying to get out of a deal he signed, with plenty of sound advice from bankers and lawyers, by maligning the business he no longer wants to own, by inventing dubious pretexts, will not be remembered as Mr. Musk's finest hour. That the Musk circularity-singularity might one day start working in reverse is a risk that attaches to this debacle.
For one thing, Tesla still seems an overvalued electric car business by most metrics, despite having shed $450 billion since April while Mr. Musk was giddily pursuing his social-media acquisition. Voters are realizing that EV tax breaks are more a favor for the wealthy than the environment. His former idolaters in the press are turning sour on Mr. Musk since he criticized Twitter for the wrong things like kicking Donald Trump off and covering up the Hunter Biden laptop story.
The save-the-planet hyperbole that filled the recent Musk biography by Ashlee Vance was always a two-edged sword, because it promised too much.
Mr. Musk is a gifted entrepreneur, one of a kind, but the market he identified for electric cars by exploiting the lithium-ion battery revolution was made possible because there was a lithium-ion battery revolution.
The market he identified for cheaper access to space exists because there's always a market for cheaper ways to do important things, like put satellites in orbit.
He did not invent or discover in baby boomers and their offspring the deep vein of romance about electric cars and space travel, which the Musk magic could turn into cash through the fanboy bidding up of Tesla's publicly traded shares, creating the net worth he uses to support other ventures.
It makes everything easier, getting investors to throw money at you.
And yet Mr. Musk seemed a bit asleep during the polarity reversal of the last few months, with inflation and interest rates going up and companies with very high multiples against skimpy current earnings like Tesla and Twitter falling out of favor.
Within a month of signing the Twitter deal, he discovered a ""super bad feeling"" about the economy and ordered Tesla to slash its payrolls by 10%. He told a Tesla enthusiasts club that the company's new factories in Germany and Texas are losing billions thanks to supply-chain issues. ""Both Berlin and Austin factories are gigantic money furnaces right now. Okay? It's really like a giant roaring sound, which is the sound of money on fire.""
How would a sane person feel at such a time about being compelled to throw cash at an overpriced, long-term turnaround project like Twitter? Pretty ill. And Mr. Musk would need to sell another $25 billion in Tesla stock to complete the Twitter purchase when he might have more pressing holes to fill in his business portfolio.
Nobody in their right mind wants him to do this right now except Twitter shareholders.
The one mystery is why Mr. Musk led himself down this primrose path in the first place, out of mouth momentum or excessive enjoyment of the limelight or for some mysterious reason that causes an onlooker to throw up his hands. Like every commentator in America, my initial take was that Mr. Musk wasn't serious about Twitter, his interest would quickly fizzle out. However much he was right that Twitter was hurting for imaginative leadership, however much he might have been the one to supply it, the menace to ventures in which he has a much deeper financial, emotional and intellectual stake was obvious from the start.

308,18-Jul-22,The Washington Post,From tech-world hero to internet provocateur,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2690876009/BFD812D457A14912PQ/403?accountid=13946,"Jai Pollard-Watkins became an Elon Musk fan in 2014, at the ripe old age of 10.
Growing up in Atlanta, he was playing the video game ""EpicDuel"" and came upon a villain character named Elon Musk wearing ""this futuristic, like, armor suit,"" Pollard-Watkins says. He was ""like Iron Man, but on steroids."" It didn't take long for him to discover that this ""Elon Musk"" was the game designers' tribute to a real Elon Musk, then a sort of niche tech-world hero.
Soon afterward, Pollard-Watkins developed an extracurricular interest in astronomy, gobbling up news about Musk's private space-exploration company, SpaceX. It was a solitary hobby. ""No one's into astronomy,"" he says with a laugh. But in the late 2010s, something surprising happened: Rappers started name-checking Musk in their lyrics, and soon Pollard-Watkins's friends were talking about Musk, too.
Now, ""Elon Musk is that guy,"" gushes Pollard-Watkins, 18, who now lives in Barbados and recently graduated high school. He's everywhere. Everybody knows him. ""He's, like, the Drake of business.""
Musk has always stood apart from other software geeks, beyond just his focus on hardware and hard problems. His image as an eccentric inventor informed Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as Iron Man, and in 2010, he made a cameo in ""Iron Man 2."" Then there were Musk's much-publicized relationships with actresses Amber Heard and Talulah Riley and the musician Grimes - and, of course, his rise to becoming the world's official richest person.
He's attended the Met Gala. He's hosted ""Saturday Night Live."" He's posed with Kanye in orange-themed outfits.
But over the past five years, Musk transformed from tech-famous to famous-famous to what one could call ""red pill"" famous. ""Take the red pill,"" he tweeted in 2020, a reference to the tablet in the ""The Matrix"" that has become associated with a conversion to right-wing views. On Twitter, where his following has nearly doubled in the past year to just over 100 million, Musk trolls the woke and hypes up fellow free-speech fans in a way that leaves one guessing. But is the world's richest man officially right wing or doing it for the lulz? Did he really plan on paying $44 billion for Twitter or was it always a lark? Though Musk filed to kill the deal and Twitter's board is suing to enforce the merger, the saga has helped expand Musk's reach as a pop-culture figure - one whose journey through those three phases of fame has made him a unique combination of influential executive, oddball celebrity and polarizing internet provocateur.
Most tech billionaires can't engage in online provocation, because it would risk hurting their businesses. And Musk's internet antics have cost him, too. He has been fined by the Securities and Exchange Commission for his tweets and some SpaceX employees signed a letter calling his public behavior distracting and embarrassing. But Musk had already cultivated a cult of personality through his companies, and his instinctive, unfiltered tweets also helped him diversify his following into ""crypto bros,"" Trump supporters, and critics who can't look away, all of whom follow him just as fiercely as aspiring start-up founders once copied his sleeping habits.
Jack Dorsey may hang out on Jay-Z and Beyoncé's yacht, Mark Zuckerberg may own a chunk of Hawaii, Bill Gates may have world leaders on speed dial. Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, may - like Musk - mingle with stars on Oscar night and have his own space-exploration company. But only Musk has fans that would mob any critic who questions their techno-king.
In other words, Musk is not a traditional celebrity so much as an online influencer, a fitting crossover for an era when a wealthy TV star like Donald Trump can tweet his way to the White House and tech billionaires seem to spend more time on social media than sequestered on their yachts.
""I'm old enough to remember a certain time in history when billionaires were reclusive,"" says Lainey Lui, founder of the celebrity-gossip website LaineyGossip. ""Culture in general has always been interested in very wealthy people and their lives. … 'What would it be like to have all that money? How do they spend it?'"" As a result, many use their extraordinary wealth to buy extraordinary privacy. But instead of going the Howard Hughes route, Lui says, ""here's a billionaire who's actually running towards the heat.""

Musk, 51, first made a name for himself in Silicon Valley in the mid-1990s, when he co-founded the internet city-guide site Zip2 (which was purchased by Compaq for about $350 million in 1999) and the online bank X.com (which later became PayPal, and was bought by eBay for $1.5 billion). In the 2000s, his visibility increased when he founded SpaceX and became the CEO of the electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla. In the mid-2010s, after years of struggle and uncertainty, Musk's success with SpaceX and Tesla turned him into an entrepreneurial icon, who seemed to single-handedly reinvigorate interest in futuristic electric cars and rockets to space, the stuff of American dreams.
It didn't hurt that Teslas also became a luxury good: Lui says Musk's star began to rise ""coinciding with the consumer public looking into Teslas, wanting Teslas, … Teslas becoming this thing that you would own for status.""
Search Amazon for ""Elon Musk biography"" these days, and you'll find yourself swamped with several dozen offerings, even more than what the site turns up about Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. Meanwhile, on Instagram and Reddit, fan accounts and forums devoted to Musk now have followers numbering in the millions.
Machine Gun Kelly and Tyler, the Creator have name-dropped Musk in song; the hook of Lil Uzi Vert's 2017 track ""Neon Guts"" goes, ""Higher than Elon Musk, so high stars eat our dust.""
Ashlee Vance, the author of the acclaimed biography ""Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future,"" points to 2018 as the inflection point in Musk's celebrity. That's the year Musk smoked weed on the ""Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast in an Occupy Mars T-shirt, which is still the most popular video on Rogan's YouTube channel. Like Musk, Rogan has found a rabid online audience with hard-to-categorize right-leaning politics and spread covid misinformation.
""He just decided to let much more of his personality loose on Twitter,"" said Vance of Musk, ""and to embrace this role as part philosopher, part troll.""
""I think that's complicated his life and complicated the stories around the businesses pretty dramatically,"" Vance adds. ""He's become such a polarizing figure, almost this religious-type figure, where you either love him or hate him, and there doesn't seem to be much room in between.""

Every time his companies stabilize, Musk goes all in and risks everything, Vance pointed out. Now he seems to be deploying the same strategy with his persona, and relishing it. ""He's always trying to one-up himself and go bigger and bigger and bigger."" (Musk did not respond to a request for comment for this report.)
The year 2018 was also when Musk showed up to the Met Gala with Grimes, with whom he has two children with the unorthodox names X Æ A-Xii and Exa Dark Sideræl. He also gained a reputation for attaching himself to media sensations, pledging that his companies would assist a 2018 mission to free 12 boys trapped in a cave in Thailand (earning criticism for calling one rescuer a ""pedo"") and in 2019 sharing a new rap track with his name attached to it titled ""RIP Harambe,"" in reference to the late Cincinnati gorilla. (It was later revealed to be performed by the L.A.-based rapper Yung Jake.) In early 2020, he released an EDM track on SoundCloud titled ""Don't Doubt ur Vibe."" That summer, after Kanye West shared the viral photo of him and Musk (caption: ""When you go to your boys house and you're both wearing orange""), Musk voiced his support for West's much-publicized bid for the presidency.
Musk's SNL hosting gig in 2021 gave him another turn at pop culture's center stage, though multiple members of the cast and crew expressed disapproval at his invitation; in an Instagram story, cast member Andrew Dismukes wrote, ""ONLY CEO I WANT TO DO A SKETCH WITH IS Cher-E Oteri."" Musk's embrace of memes on social media - ""Who controls the memes, controls the Universe,"" he tweeted in 2020 - has also annoyed creatives for his habit of cropping out their name when he shares their work.
Musk's turn in the limelight has also further elevated the profile of his mother, Maye, a longtime model. She appeared with him at Met Galas and on SNL, and was also featured in the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue.
Meanwhile, a big boost to Musk's online popularity happened when he rode the wave of interest in crypto in early 2021, said Jason Urgo, chief executive of Social Blade, a social media analytics firm. The same month that Tesla announced it would accept bitcoin, Musk started tweeting about another cryptocurrency, dogecoin, and its price hit a high. This seeming influence allowed Musk to ""tap into a completely different market of people,"" namely the crypto crowd, Urgo said.
Musk also got a viral boost by inserting himself in another 2021 financial frenzy, when individual investors banded together to drive up the share price of GameStop stock. After the trading app Robinhood halted its trading of GameStop, leading to mass outrage, Musk took up the cause of retail traders and grilled the Robinhood CEO live on the audio app Clubhouse - casting himself as a populist hero of these small-time traders, all in the wee hours of the morning, another Musk specialty.

Twitter, however, is where Musk made his ""Take the red pill"" declaration. ""Taken!"" Ivanka Trump replied. Despite seeming to have a fine relationship with Democrats during the Obama administration and hold some liberal views, Musk has recently taken aim at the left and embraced Republican causes useful to his companies, such as fewer coronavirus restrictions, less regulation and lower taxes. He tweeted in March 2020 that ""the coronavirus panic is dumb"" and two months later proceeded to reopen the Tesla factory in Fremont, Calif., in defiance of local mandates. The president, Trump, tweeted his approval.
Musk also began interacting with right-wing accounts, including Benny Johnson and the Babylon Bee, and parroting conservative views by questioning trans rights and tweeting that ""the woke mind virus will destroy civilization."" He said in May that if he were to buy Twitter, he'd reverse the ban on Trump, who was kicked off the platform because of the ""risk of further incitement of violence"" after a mob of the president's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. A whole new subset of Americans were now rooting for Musk.
Ever since the deal soured, however - and since Musk indicated that he was leaning toward Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in the 2024 presidential election - Musk has been openly feuding with the former president. Trump called Musk a ""bulls--- artist"" at a July 9 rally, to which Musk responded on Twitter, ""I don't hate the man, but it's time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset."" Trump posted Tuesday on Truth Social that during his presidency, Musk had come to him asking for help with his subsidized ""driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere."" ""I could have said, 'drop to your knees and beg,'"" Trump wrote, ""and he would have done it."" Musk's response when Vance tweeted a screenshot of Trump's post: ""Lmaooo.""
Certainly, the pair's relationship was quietly fraught for a while: After a SpaceX launch at the Kennedy Space Center in May 2020, Trump spoke to a large crowd that included several high-profile Florida Republicans. Trump called on Musk, in the audience, to stand up, but when Musk received a rowdier cheer from the rest of the crowd than Trump had, Trump attempted to curtail it: ""Sit down, Elon.""
In recent months, Musk has brushed off a succession of scandals. In May, he greeted an allegation reported by Insider that he propositioned and exposed himself to a flight attendant (which he has denied) with a crude joke about genitalia. When the news broke earlier this month that he fathered twins with an executive at his brain-implant start-up, Neuralink, he tweeted, ""Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis.""
The headline-grabbing Twitter saga threatens to further Musk's reputation as a purveyor of provocations. Musk initially cast himself as the swashbuckling iconoclast shaking up a stagnant company with his take-it-or-leave-it purchase offer. Fanboys were sure he was playing 4D chess. But after he tried to back out of the deal, complaining of a lack of information on bot accounts, Twitter's lawsuit argues that he gave no regard to hurting the reputation of a company that he had a fiduciary duty to protect. Musk tweeted in response: ""Oh the irony lol.""

Although his follower count has risen, some see Musk's rightward shift as dimming his star with mass audiences. Book agent Howard Yoon said readers initially gravitated toward Musk because people love the idea that geniuses exist, and his fixation on saving the planet set him apart from other Silicon Valley CEOs, Yoon said. ""Now he's just some culture warrior.""
Hammad Ahmed, 32, became a Musk fan when he was in college, around 2009. He quickly began comparing Musk to Steve Jobs, another tech hero he admired. Tesla had impressed him, SpaceX even more so. ""I think for me what really stood out was just how broadly ambitious his goals were,"" recalls Ahmed, an equity trader in Houston.
Ahmed began to reassess his support for Musk in 2020, when Musk began questioning the U.S. government's coronavirus protections. Given the following that Musk had amassed by then on the platform, ""I just felt like it was a bit irresponsible for him to be engaging in that way, especially because of how serious things were at the time,"" Ahmed says. ""I felt like it was maybe just adding to a lot of the misinformation noise that was there.""
For some fans, though, the newfound and controversial outspokenness that has accompanied Musk's rise has only solidified his status as legend, phenomenon, the Man. Pollard-Watkins, for instance, sees it as a quality that sets him apart from other megasuccessful entrepreneurs.
""He's one of the very few billionaires that, like, the cat doesn't have their tongue, you know what I'm saying?"" Pollard-Watkins says. ""It's my favorite thing about him.""

309,18-Jul-22,Barron's (Online),"Tech News Today for Financial Advisors: Google Splits, IBM Reports, Musk Vacations",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2691111577/BFD812D457A14912PQ/432?accountid=13946,"This year Silicon Valley has certainly lost its groove. Many of the growth companies have suffered massive drops in their stock prices. The industry has also seen an uptick in layoffs. 
By bringing down the stock prices, splits like Google's on Monday, may generate more interest from retail investors. PHOTO: Photo Illustration by Barron's Advisor; Dreamstime (2)
But maybe things have become too negative? During the past few weeks, tech has pulled off a decent rally. Even the beleaguered ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) has posted a 13% gain since the start of July.
It's impossible to tell if this will last. Second quarter earnings, which include IBM (IBM) Monday after the close, could tell the tale. No doubt, there will continue to be lots of action in the tech sector. Here is some of the news for financial advisors to focus on for this week.
An alphabet split: Alphabet, which is the parent company of Google, enacted a 20-for-1 split Monay . It's the first stock split since 2014.
The tech industry has seen other splits of major companies, such as Amazon and Nvidia. Tesla plans to have one as well.
By bringing down the stock prices, this may encourage more retail interest. This is especially important as markets have been generally bearish.
However, Alphabet's split has not done much for its own stock today. The price is unchanged.
Then again, investors are likely more interested in the company's second-quarter earnings report, which comes out next week.
Tech earnings: On Monday after the close, IBM (IBM) reports quarterly earnings , kicking off tech earnings season. Tuesday, Netflix (NFLX) will report its results. Ahead of it, Wall Street has been cutting estimates . There are nagging concerns about competition, password sharing, sluggish user growth, and the costs of original content.
Then on Wednesday, Tesla will announce its earnings . The company has faced headwinds from severe Covid-19 lockdowns in China, higher inflation and production ramp ups in Germany and Texas. Elon Musk has also expressed concerns about the economy. Last month, he said he had a "" super bad feeling "" about it.
Despite all this, Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner thinks that Tesla stock is a good buy now . He made it a ""catalyst call,"" which is when there's an expectation of a big move on the upside in the near-term.
Crypto comeback: The headlines for the past few weeks have been awful. A court in the British Virgin Islands ordered crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital to liquidate. Then there were the bankruptcies of crypto lenders Celsius Network and Voyager Digital.
But somehow, the crypto market has been able to adapt. And perhaps the fears of contagion have been overblown.
During the past week, Bitcoin jumped from $19,000 to $22,400. The bullishness also spread to crypto companies like Coinbase, whose stock has spiked 17% in Monday's trading.
Twitter drama: Yes, the Musk v. Twitter litigation will be unlike any other case to hit the venerable Delaware courts. After all, judge Kathaleen McCormick will have to rule on some unusual evidence, including Musk's poop emoji.
On Friday, Musk's attorneys fired back with a response to Twitter's lawsuit to enforce the $44 billion merger agreement . It pleaded that there should not be an expedited trial.
But for Musk, this week may actually be quiet. He's vacationing on a luxury yacht in Mykonos, Greece, according to People.com . Photos of Musk show little concern about his legal woes.

Twitter Inc. called Elon Musk's opposition to a speedy trial for its case against the billionaire a tactical delay and said his proposed timeline is ""calculated to complicate and obfuscate.""
The social-media company argued Monday in a legal filing in Delaware Chancery Court that the public dispute harms Twitter every day that Mr. Musk is in breach of their $44 billion agreement. Twitter reiterated that the court should set trial by mid-September, on an expedited schedule.
 Mr. Musk's lawyers asked on Friday for a trial date on or after Feb. 13 of next year, saying they need more time to drill down into the fake and spam account issue that the billionaire has cited as the chief reason for terminating the deal. They added the debt financing was valid until April 25, 2023.
A remote hearing is scheduled for Tuesday morning on Twitter's motion to expedite the case.
Twitter said in the filing Monday that Mr. Musk's alleged core issue—an accurate count of fake and spam accounts—is a ""contractually irrelevant sideshow.""

Last week Twitter sued Mr. Musk in Delaware Chancery Court, seeking to force Mr. Musk to honor the terms of the deal after he moved to abandon it. The company asked the court to expedite the proceedings, citing risks from the recent economic downturn and being held in limbo by a buyer.
Mr. Musk has said he wants out of the deal because Twitter didn't provide him with the necessary data and information he needed to assess the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on its platform. The company has long estimated that less than 5% of its monetizable daily active users fit that description, while Mr. Musk has said it is likely closer to 20%.
On Friday, Mr. Musk's lawyers filed a motion to oppose an expedited trial, arguing that the dispute over false and spam accounts ""is fundamental to Twitter's value"" and ""extremely fact and expert intensive, requiring substantial time for discovery."" The document was the first in which Mr. Musk's side laid out publicly a clear timeline around his concerns over data about fake and spam accounts and included new claims about Twitter's level of cooperation on the issue.
In its response Monday to Mr. Musk's motion, Twitter said the billionaire hasn't offered a sound reason for delaying the trial and it noted that the Delaware Chancery Court has previously resolved many merger-enforcement disputes within 60 to 75 days, which is in line with the schedule it is seeking for its case against Mr. Musk.
Twitter added that getting the trial under way quickly is ""imperative"" because the dispute itself is harming its business and that Mr. Musk is amplifying the problem by using the platform to disparage the company. Employees, customers and shareholders have been hurt as a result, the company said.
""No public company of this size and scale has ever had to bear these uncertainties,"" Twitter said.
Twitter said in its suit against Mr. Musk that it thinks the real reason he is looking to exit from the deal is that market conditions have soured since he made his bid for it, resulting in his personal wealth declining by more than $100 billion from its November 2021 peak. The company also said it had bent over backward to accommodate the billionaire's data requests, including by giving him access to its so-called fire hose of near real-time tweets as well as historical tweets.
Mr. Musk's side has alleged in court filings that the Tesla Inc. CEO's interactions with Twitter were akin to ""a two-month treasure hunt of delays, technical bottlenecks, evasive answers, and, ultimately, refusals."" His team said they became concerned about Twitter's user numbers after the company announced revisions in its first-quarter earnings in April. Twitter said then it had overstated its user base for nearly three years through the end of 2021 because of an error in how it accounted for people linked to multiple accounts. The revision reduced the number of monetizable daily active users by 0.9% for the fourth quarter of last year.
In a May 6 meeting with Twitter executives about how spam is calculated, Mr. Musk 's team on Friday said he was ""flabbergasted to learn just how meager Twitter's process was"" and pointed to the absence of automated tools to help with the calculation.

But his U-turn on buying Twitter could be one of his most costly moves yet.The dispute is now in Chancery Court in Delaware, where Twitter is suing Musk to force him to complete the deal and Musk is countering to get out of the deal. On Tuesday, a judge hearing the case largely agreed with Twitter and scheduled a five-day trial in October, rejecting Musk's bid to delay the proceedings until next year.Boston College law professor Brian Quinn, who was a mergers and acquisitions lawyer in Silicon Valley before joining academia, says there is almost no chance Musk will prevail in court.Just a few weeks after the billionaire agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share, or $44 billion, Musk began expressing reservations. Twitter's stock price had plunged along with most other tech stocks, including Tesla, which makes up the bulk of Musk's fortune. On May 13, the billionaire tweeted that his Twitter deal was “temporarily on hold.”Musk complained that Twitter had misled him about the extent of spam accounts and bots infesting the service.It's a strange rationale for abandoning the deal, since Musk had said one of his main motivations to buy Twitter was to fix the problem of spam accounts and bots infesting the service. Musk has more than 100 million followers, but many are fake accounts that instantly respond to his posts with cryptocurrency scams or other rackets.In an interview at the TED conference in April before he agreed to buy Twitter, Musk referred to one of his favorite cryptocurrencies and declared that “If I had a dogecoin for every crypto scam I saw, I would have a hundred billion dogecoin.” A week later, he tweeted: “If our twitter bid succeeds, we will defeat the spam bots or die trying!”Twitter did not actually promise anything about the bot problem — or even mention it — in the 73-page sale agreement with Musk. The company did maintain that all of its securities filings were accurate, or in legalese, “fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the company.”And Twitter's prior filings said that fake accounts made up less than 5 percent of the monetizable daily active users it reports. Even that disclosure came with many caveats.“It's hard to take that as a serious argument because it's not as if he was unaware of bots, in fact he probably was more aware than anybody else,” BC's Quinn said in an interview. “It's hard to imagine that's going to be a successful argument in court.”Three outcomes are most likely, Quinn said. The judge could force Musk to buy Twitter at the original price; the parties could renegotiate a lower purchase price in light of the stock market crash, or the parties could settle out of court.“Twitter could say 'you don't want to buy us and we don't want you to buy us, so there must be a number,'” Quinn said. “Some number that's less than $44 billion and will be enough to let Twitter walk away happy.”Such a settlement would involve Musk paying somewhere between $5 billion and $20 billion, Quinn estimated.“For normal people that's crazy,” he said. “But here we're dealing with a different kind of person, and all the commas and the decimal point are in different places.”"

In addition, space-inspired collectibles will debut next year on Mattel Creations, the company's direct-to-consumer platform that sells pricier and more-detailed variations of its toys for collectors.
The toy company behind Barbie dolls and Hot Wheels cars has worked with Mr. Musk, the billionaire who also runs the electric-car company Tesla Inc., in the past.
Mattel in 2020 developed two remote-control vehicles based on the Tesla Cybertruck: a smaller $20 and a $400 limited-edition model.
When Elon Musk launched a Tesla Roadster into space in 2018, a Mattel version of the car, complete with a miniature spaceman, was mounted on its dashboard .
Mattel is set to report its second-quarter earnings after the market close on Thursday. Analysts expect the company to post slightly higher earnings per share and revenue for the period, according to FactSet.

313,21-Jul-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Companies Swallow $2.1 Billion in Taxes as Executive Pay Climbs; Tesla, Howmet and others rack up bigger tax bills after Congress limits deductions for executives and pay over $1 million",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2691996857/BFD812D457A14912PQ/199?accountid=13946,"Electric-car maker Tesla booked $447 million in taxes on executive pay over three years. PHOTO: Sergio Flores for The Wall Street Journal
Companies are racking up hundreds of millions of dollars in income taxes on pay for top executives, a growing bill that in some cases makes up a sizable chunk of their annual tax expense.
Tesla Inc. booked $447 million in taxes on executive pay over three years. Pay for officers generated nearly 20% of all tax costs booked by defense contractor Howmet Aerospace Inc. in the same period. At cosmetics retailer Ulta Beauty Inc., executive pay subject to corporate tax has more than tripled since 2019.
Companies typically may deduct employee pay from their income for U.S. tax purposes, as a business expense. (Employees are taxed when receiving the pay.)
Congress has increasingly denied this tax deduction to companies for the pay they give to top executives. The Republican tax overhaul in 2017 ended the deduction for any pay over $1 million a year for top officers of publicly traded companies, as well as some others. Until then, companies could generally deduct certain officers' pay over $1 million only if it was sufficiently tied to performance.
After the 2017 change , a company paying its chief executive $2 million could deduct the first $1 million, and would have to pay tax at the 21% corporate rate on the remainder, or $210,000. Congressional drafters expected the provision to raise $9.2 billion in new revenue over a decade, according to late-2017 projections from Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation. The measure was intended to raise revenue to offset the cost of other tax cuts.
About three dozen companies in the S&P 500 reported paying a combined total of just under $2.1 billion in taxes on nondeductible compensation over the past three years, rising to $850 million last year from $480 million in 2019, a Wall Street Journal analysis found. Twenty of the companies explicitly linked the tax cost to pay for executives.
Underlying pay at least doubled for a third of the companies, including Tesla, home builder Lennar Corp. and Ulta Beauty, the Journal analysis found.
Companies aren't consistent in how, or even whether, they report these costs. They must report the tax cost only if they consider the amount material. Amazon.com Inc., for example, said it books tax expense for nondeductible compensation but doesn't disclose the figure, deeming it immaterial.
At Advanced Micro Devices Inc., taxes on officers' pay lower the tax benefits the company reports for paying employees with stock, but AMD doesn't break out the parts. A spokeswoman said nearly all the nondeductible pay was equity. ""As a result, it is appropriately disclosed,"" she said.
Some health insurers for years have been unable to deduct pay over $500,000 a year for any employee, under a provision of the 2010 Affordable Care Act. UnitedHealth Group Inc. booked nearly $400 million in costs from the tax over three years, securities filings show, or about 3% of its total tax expense for the period.
Most companies in the Journal analysis make clear that the compensation being taxed is that of executives or top officers, in some cases referring directly to the 2017 tax provision in their securities filings. Companies generally declined to say how many executives received nondeductible compensation.
Although companies are aware of the rising tax costs, compensation consultants say it rarely affects pay negotiations with top executives. The median pay for S&P 500 CEOs rose to a record $14.7 million in 2021, according to an earlier Journal analysis.
""This loss of a tax deduction is considered to be a drop in the bucket, so nobody's paying attention to it,"" said Robin Ferracone, CEO of pay consulting firm Farient Advisors. ""What's going on in the talent market to retain and keep talent, and that includes executives, way overwhelms whether they're particularly expensive because of"" the tax change.
A recent analysis from researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, University of Chicago and Indiana University found that limiting tax deductions for executive pay hasn't affected how companies paid those executives. The study was published in the journal Contemporary Accounting Research.
Tesla's compensation-tax expense outstripped those of other companies in the Journal analysis, and made up just over 40% of its total tax expense for the three-year period. CEO Elon Musk is among the highest-paid CEOs of recent years, thanks to a 2018 package valued , at the time, at $2.3 billion. At recent share prices, the stock options Mr. Musk has already received under the arrangement are valued at about $60 billion.
Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment. Accounting experts note that rapidly changing share prices can lead to a mismatch between the cost reported for specific tax provisions and the compensation expense companies have booked on their financial statements.
Howmet Aerospace, a descendant of one-time aluminum giant Alcoa, said losing the deduction on executive pay generated 19.5% of its total tax expense over the past three years, or $21.5 million. The tax figure implies the company booked the equivalent of about $1 in nondeductible executive compensation for every $7 in pretax income it reported.
A Howmet spokesman declined to comment beyond confirming its disclosures.
Companies may still deduct some pay over $1 million, if it is paid out under written contracts that haven't changed significantly since early November 2017. But as these grandfathered agreements expire, replaced with newer ones, the tax bill for nondeductible pay is likely to grow.
Lennar's tax cost for nondeductible compensation rose to $29 million last year, suggesting that it paid more than $135 million subject to corporate tax, up from $52 million in 2019. Lennar declined to comment.
At Ulta Beauty, the amount of pay subject to the new tax rose to almost $31 million from $8.6 million over three years.
A spokeswoman for Ulta said the number of current and former officers increased in 2021 as part of a CEO transition, and a 2018 one-time equity grant to the company's former CEO vested last year, both of which increased the amount of nondeductible pay. In addition, she added, pay was low in 2019 because the company missed performance expectations.
""Ulta Beauty's financial performance in 2021 was outstanding, exceeding internal expectations,"" the Ulta spokeswoman said. ""This performance was reflected in both cash and equity perspectives in our executive compensation.""

314,21-Jul-22,Standard - Speaker,Tesla's Musk signals optimism on end to supply chain issues,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2692800009/BFD812D457A14912PQ/203?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc. has been going through “supply chain hell,” but Elon Musk believes the electric-car maker stands a chance of emerging from it in the second half of the year.
The chief executive officer tempered his optimism while discussing Tesla’s better-than-expected earnings, emphasizing how challenging it’s been to secure parts and materials. Tesla sold roughly 75% of its Bitcoin holding due to concerns about the company’s liquidity last quarter, when its Shanghai plant shut for weeks.
“We have the potential for a record-breaking second half of the year,” Musk said on a call with analysts Wednesday. “The past few years have been quite a few force majeures, and it’s been kind of supply chain hell for several years.”
Tesla shares rose 2.6% to $761.51 as of 8:25 a.m. Thursday in New York, before the start of regular trading. The stock has fallen 30% this year.
The first major US automaker to report second-quarter results said in a letter to shareholders that increasing production at its two newest plants, in Germany and Texas, will take time and require overcoming ongoing supply issues. Musk, 51, said that while the larger battery cells Tesla has been trying to make itself won’t be an important factor this year, the company has enough older-generation cells to meet its needs.
Tesla left unchanged its plan to increase vehicle deliveries by 50% on average annually over multiple years. It will have to pick up the pace to hit that mark in the second half, as issues ranging from supply shortages and labor to logistical problems kept its factories from running at full capacity.
“They are maintaining their 50% growth rate, which is a bit of a surprise. I thought they might back off from that,” said Gene Munster of Loup Ventures. “They are doing a good job navigating a difficult environment.”
Tesla posted adjusted earnings of $2.27 a share, besting the $1.83 a share average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That was below the $3.22 per share Tesla made in the first quarter, marking the first sequential profit decline since the end of 2020.
Analysts are paying close attention to how quickly Tesla can ramp up output of its mass-market Model Y SUV from its new factories, and introduce its long-awaited Cybertruck pickup. Musk said on the call that Tesla is on track to start producing the truck in the middle of next year and thinks it could be the company’s “best product ever.”
Tesla said previously it delivered 254,695 vehicles worldwide in the quarter, up 27% from a year ago but down from its first-quarter record of 310,048. It was the first time in two years the company failed to increase vehicle deliveries from one quarter to the next.
In April, Musk predicted the company would produce more than 1.5 million vehicles this year. Tesla had made about 564,000 through the first half.
Tesla’s total revenue rose 42% from a year ago to $16.9 billion, meeting analysts’ average estimate. Sales from regulatory credits totaled $344 million, down from $679 million in the first quarter.
Musk called Tesla’s dalliance in digital currencies “a sideshow to a sideshow” and said the company is open to increasing its holdings of cryptocurrencies even after it reported a Bitcoin impairment that reduced second-quarter earnings.
The sale of most of Tesla’s digital assets “should not be seen as “some verdict on Bitcoin,” he said."

On Friday before the market open, Twitter is scheduled to release its second-quarter financial results that will offer an important update on the state of the digital advertising market and Twitter's (ticker: TWTR) core business.
The Wall Street consensus estimates for Twitter is for the company to report June quarter revenue of $1.323 billion with adjusted earnings per share of 14 cents. Analysts also expect average monetizable daily active users to come in at 238.1 million for the second quarter.
On Wednesday, KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson reaffirmed his Sector Weighting rating for Twitter shares and downplayed near-term financial results.
""We continue to believe TWTR stock will trade less on fundamentals and more on views around the case with Elon Musk,"" he wrote.
Twitter shares were nearly flat Thursday afternoon around $39.50. The stock is down nearly 9% this year and trades at a large discount to Musk's original offer for the company in April of $54.20 per share in cash. The technology entrepreneur has been trying to back out of his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter.
Earlier this week, a Delaware Chancery Court judge said Twitter can fast-track its lawsuit against Musk, which aims to force him to stick to his agreement to buy the social media company. The judge set a five-day trial for October.

Twitter's results Friday follow rival social-media company Snap Inc. posting its weakest-ever quarterly sales growth because of what it said was ""increasing competition for advertising dollars that are now growing more slowly.""
Twitter, in its news release, cited ""advertising industry headwinds associated with the macroenvironment as well as uncertainty related to the pending acquisition of Twitter."" The company said it wouldn't host an earnings conference call because of the pending transaction, which it is suing Mr. Musk to complete .
Twitter's revenue dipped to $1.18 billion from $1.19 billion a year ago, and was below the average analyst estimate of $1.32 billion on FactSet.
Advertising revenue rose 2% from a year earlier to $1.08 billion. In the first quarter, advertising revenue grew 23%.
 Twitter's slowdown in ad revenue suggests the turmoil surrounding Mr. Musk's deal is irking advertisers, said Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali. ""Advertisers don't even want to deal with Twitter until they know what's going on,"" he said. The company is ""caught in the middle of a nightmare.""
Twitter shares rose around 1% to close at $39.94 Friday. Snap shares tumbled 39% to end the regular trading day at $9.96.
Mr. Musk's $54.20-a-share bid for Twitter has helped hold up the company's stock price amid a sharp selloff in tech company stocks . Twitter's stock price was down less than 10% so far this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index has lost more than 20%.
""Thank God they have a deal in place because the stock would be so much lower without it,"" said MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson.
Twitter reported a loss of $270 million, or 35 cents a share, compared with year-ago earnings of $65.6 million, or 8 cents a share. Excluding items like stock-based compensation, the company reported an adjusted loss of 8 cents a share. Analysts, on average, were expecting an adjusted profit of 14 cents a share, FactSet shows.

The number of Twitter's monetizable average daily active users increased to 237.8 million from 229 million in the first quarter and 206 million a year ago. U.S. users—who make up the company's biggest market—grew to 41.5 million from 39.6 million in the first quarter and 37 million a year ago. The company said the increase was driven by product improvements and global conversation around current events.
Twitter needs to do more to stand out against the online advertising market leaders like Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook, said KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Justin Patterson. Uncertainty about the future of the deal with Mr. Musk, he said, could get in the way of that and product innovation.
In a lawsuit against Mr. Musk, Twitter said his ""actions in derogation of the deal's consummation, and Musk's repeated disparagement of Twitter and its personnel, create uncertainty."" Such behaviors ""also expose Twitter to adverse effects on its business operations, employees, and stock price,"" the complaint says.
A spokesman for Twitter said the company has made more than a dozen recent product innovations, including Twitter Circle, a way to send tweets to a select group; CoTweets, which lets two co-authors of a tweet post it simultaneously; and Unmention, a feature that lets users remove themselves from Twitter conversations they were brought into by others.
At the release of its results in April, Twitter said that it was withdrawing earlier goals and outlooks and that it wouldn't provide forward-looking guidance. Before Mr. Musk's courtship, Twitter had been working to achieve three main goals by the end of 2023: to surpass $7.5 billion in annual revenue, reach 315 million daily users and double the pace at which it produces new technology.
Earlier this week, Delaware Chancery Court's chief judge granted Twitter's request to fast-track its lawsuit against Mr. Musk. A five-day trial is scheduled for October despite opposition from the billionaire's lawyers , who argued that a trial should take place on or after Feb. 13 of next year .
Mr. Musk has said his primary reason for backing out of the deal is a lack of faith in Twitter's estimate that less than 5% of its monetizable daily active users are spam or fake accounts. He has said that estimate is probably too low.

Twitter has said for years in its securities filings that the number of fake and spam accounts on its platform could be higher than its estimates. The company said in its lawsuit against Mr. Musk that he has buyer's remorse over the fall in share prices since he agreed to the deal in April.
In a recent court filing, Mr. Musk's team said they became concerned about Twitter's user numbers after the company disclosed in its April earnings report that it had overstated its user base for nearly three years through the end of 2021 because of an error in how it accounted for people linked to multiple accounts.

 Twitter Reports Drop in Revenue, Blames Uncertainty Over Elon Musk Deal

The social media company swung to a loss in the second quarter and cited as a factor the “uncertainty” over its pending takeover by the billionaire Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive. (Jim Wilson/The New York Times)
Twitter is embroiled in a grueling legal fight with Elon Musk as he tries to back out of a $44 billion acquisition of the company. It has slowed its hiring as it grapples with a flagging economy. Its stock price has slumped.
On Friday, Twitter revealed the toll from those challenges. In an earnings report, the company said the uncertainty caused by Musk had hurt its business, alongside macroeconomic troubles. Twitter’s quarterly revenue declined for the first time since 2020 as it struggled to be a destination for advertisers and swung to a net loss.
The lackluster earnings report ramps up the blame game that has erupted between Twitter and Musk, who swooped in and exposed the company’s lack of business and financial prospects as he has gone back-and-forth over buying the social media service. Musk, who also leads electric carmaker Tesla, had agreed to buy Twitter in April and said he would take it private. He privately told investors that he could quintuple the company’s revenue by 2028 and expand it to 931 million users that same year.
But as the stock market has teetered, pulling down shares of Tesla — which is his main source of wealth and which lost a third of its value this year — Musk made increasingly barbed comments about Twitter. This month, he moved to terminate the deal. Twitter has since sued him to complete the purchase, and a five-day trial to adjudicate the matter is scheduled for October in Delaware Chancery Court.
“Twitter now has an acquirer who no longer wants it, it has a CEO and a board who want to get rid of it, and an employee base who is caught in the middle,” said Mike Proulx, a research director at Forrester. “None of this is good for Twitter.”
In its earnings statement, Twitter attributed the disappointing results to “advertising industry headwinds associated with the macroenvironment as well as uncertainty related to the pending acquisition of Twitter by an affiliate of Elon Musk.”
In total, revenue was $1.18 billion for the second quarter, down 1% from a year earlier, a far cry from the 20% growth that it had once predicted for the year. Twitter’s revenue fell 2% from the first to second quarter, which roughly coincides with the periods immediately before and after Musk made his move on the company.
The company’s net loss was $270 million, a major swing down from a profit of $66 million a year earlier, as costs and expenses grew.
There was one bright spot: Twitter said it had 237.8 million daily active users who saw ads, up nearly 17% from a year earlier.
Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
In recent months, Twitter and other social media companies have confronted a gloomy advertising market. Fears about an economic downturn and the war in Ukraine have tamped down ad spending, which social media firms rely on for most of their revenue.

On Thursday, Snap, the maker of Snapchat, reported its slowest-ever rate of quarterly growth and a wider loss. Snap’s shares plunged 39% on Friday, pushing its market capitalization below $17 billion.
Twitter’s and Snap’s earnings could bode ill for other internet firms that rely on advertising for the bulk of their earnings. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, and Google report earnings next week.

Twitter faces additional worries from advertisers about the potential takeover by Musk, who has said he hates advertising and wants to relax Twitter’s content moderation policies, which have prevented ads from appearing alongside objectionable content.
Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s chief executive, has told employees the company has not lived up to its potential and has cut costs, fired top executives and exhorted employees to ignore Musk’s fireworks in recent months.
Still, the economic headwinds detailed by Twitter on Friday might not be a big worry to current shareholders if a court forces Musk to take ownership of the company at his proposed price of $54.20 per share, said Rich Greenfield, a co-founder of LightShed Partners, a research firm.
“The funny thing is, earnings sort of don’t matter,” he said. “At the end of the day, if they sell the company at $54.20, it’s Elon’s problem, not the market’s problem.”
Twitter’s share price was $51.70 on April 25, the day the company’s board accepted Musk’s offer. But the stock has largely headed downhill since, spending the past month below $40. Its shares declined less than 1% in early trading Friday but were up nearly 1% at the close.
Investors will be concerned about Twitter’s revenue only if the deal collapses and the company’s business fundamentals regain their importance, Greenfield added. “If the deal fully falls apart, we know the stock would go down,” he said. “But the question is, ‘How much?’”
Musk has also accused Twitter of misleading investors and undercounting the inauthentic accounts on its platform. The company has said that those accounts make up fewer than 5% of the active users on its platform and that it uses experts to audit its count. Twitter reiterated this figure in Friday’s filing.

As its battle with Musk unfolds, Twitter has tried to avoid the spotlight. For the second quarter in a row, the company declined to hold an earnings call with Wall Street analysts, dodging the uncomfortable questions about Musk’s effect on the business that might have been raised.
“The company is exceedingly quiet,” Greenfield said. “It’s been months since any investors had any conversations with the company.”
Musk also faces business concerns at Tesla. The carmaker reported Wednesday that its quarterly profit had fallen because of supply-chain delays and the price of bitcoin, which the company had invested in.

318,22-Jul-22,Barron's (Online),Are Stocks Near a Bottom?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2692822951/BFD812D457A14912PQ/623?accountid=13946,"One of Warren Buffett's oft-told maxims is that investors should be ""fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."" There's been no shortage of fear this year. A BofA Securities survey of almost 300 fund managers directing $800 billion in assets reflects such deep pessimism that BofA strategists see capitulation.
Capitulation occurs when investors grow so worried about future earnings and slower growth that they unload stocks, further tanking the market, rather than hang on in hope of an upturn. Such a slump, coming when there isn't bad news to send shares lower, can mean sentiment isn't likely to worsen, and that a bottom has been hit.
In the survey, equity fund managers' cash holdings hit 6.1%, the highest tally since October 2001, in the aftermath of 9/11. A net negative 40% of respondents said they are overweight equities; that's the percentage of respondents who said they are overweight stocks minus the percentage who aren't. When positioning reaches such extremes, stocks tend to have only one direction to go, even if fundamentals continue to look shaky.
The respondents' three most popular sectors are defensive: consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare. Commodities still have fans, while tech, consumer discretionary, and anything euro-zone don't. The net percentage of fund managers expecting growth to improve was negative 79% in July, and those who expected profits to deteriorate hit an all-time high.
None of this means the decline is over, but it does signal that the worst might be in the rearview mirror.
Last Week
Grade Inflation
How big will the Federal Reserve go next week? As the week began, the consensus swung to another 0.75% rate hike. The European Central Bank raised rates 0.5%, its first hike in 11 years. Stocks took off on a multiday rally, fueled by earnings not deemed terrible, but it reversed on Friday. On the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.95% to 31,899.29; the S&P 500 2.55% to 3961.63; and the Nasdaq Composite 3.33% to 11,834.11.
The Earnings Beat
Goldman Sachs beat on falling profits, thanks to its traders, but warned of a hiring slowdown. Profit and revenue fell at Bank of America, but it beat. Netflix shed 970,000 subscribers, better than its forecast; shares surged. Tesla beat on profits, which fell from the first quarter. Snap and Twitter whiffed big-time, erasing $130 billion off social-media stocks on Friday. Snap fell 39%. Twitter blamed Elon Musk.
Chips Today, Climate Later
The Senate moved closer to passing a $52 billion semiconductor support plan. Intel had said it might not move forward on a $20 billion foundry in Ohio if the bill doesn't pass. Separately, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin's opposition may doom climate-change legislation—President Biden, who came down with Covid, says he will take executive action instead—and global tax reform. The Jan. 6 committee probed what former President Trump was up to while rioters attacked the Capitol.
Spies, Wheat, and Gas
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky fired his security chief, a childhood friend, and his top prosecutor on grounds they failed to root out Russian spies. Ukraine began a counteroffensive in the south. Ukraine and Russia agreed to ship 18 million tons of grain out of the Black Sea, Iran made an energy deal with Russia, and Russian natural gas resumed flowing to Europe.
After Boris
The runoff to replace Boris Johnson as U.K. prime minister will feature Foreign Minister Liz Truss against front-runner Rishi Sunak, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer. In Italy, President Mario Draghi won a confidence vote but resigned after his coalition crumbled. A snap election looms.
Temperature Rising
Record heat gripped the U.K., which declared a national emergency, and parts of Europe. Wildfires spread. A heat dome spread across much of the U.S., and some 86 Chinese cities issued heat alerts.

In a court filing Friday, a federal judge ordered the settlement conference via Zoom on Oct. 3, adding to an already busy month for Mr. Musk. He also faces a five-day October trial in Twitter Inc.'s lawsuit seeking to compel him to complete his $44 billion purchase of the social-media company, and a trial over his compensation package at Tesla. In 2018, Mr. Musk tweeted , ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."" The Securities and Exchange Commission deemed that a misleading statement. Mr. Musk agreed to pay a $20 million fine and to step down as Tesla's chairman in September of that year.
Mr. Musk is seeking to terminate that settlement with the SEC. Tesla also paid a $20 million fine.
In the shareholder litigation, Tesla investors are seeking to recover billions of dollars in damages after Mr. Musk's tweets disrupted markets. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen, who is overseeing the case, earlier this year ruled that Mr. Musk's tweets about taking the company private were false and misleading. A trial is scheduled for January, if no agreement is reached.
The court ordered that 10 days before the settlement conference, both sides must submit an exchanged settlement conference statement and a confidential settlement letter.
Mr. Musk's attorney, Alex Spiro, declined to comment Saturday.
Mr. Musk is seeking to walk away from his $44 billion agreement to acquire Twitter , claiming that the company didn't provide information on fake and spam accounts on the platform. Twitter has said it was sharing information with Mr. Musk as required by the merger agreement.
Twitter filed a lawsuit seeking to compel the sale, arguing that Mr. Musk changed his mind after a market downturn that resulted in his personal wealth declining by more than $100 billion. Last week, a judge in Delaware approved Twitter's request to fast-track the lawsuit, setting a trial for October.

322,23-Jul-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: Elon Musk Is Just One Of Twitter's Troubles --- The social-media business is deteriorating,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2692951251/BFD812D457A14912PQ/606?accountid=13946,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Twitter's shareholders are placing their hopes on a Chance card, but the company might never pass go or collect $200.
Snap Inc.'s dismal results on Thursday showed social media's advertising business has serious problems: Macroeconomic conditions are weakening, Apple's privacy changes have made ad targeting more difficult and, unsurprisingly, spending on smaller platforms has been the first to go. As a fun plot twist, Twitter has a unique problem in Elon Musk.
The social-media company said Friday its revenue for the second quarter declined year on year, its business lost hundreds of millions of dollars and its daily active monetizable users (essentially, those who can view ads) in the U.S. fell short of Wall Street's expectations. It isn't a good look for a business that can best be described as in limbo as it prepares to force itself on a now unwilling acquirer in court.
Twitter's shares nonetheless rose 0.8% Friday to $39.84, buoyed no doubt by the $54.20 a share Mr. Musk agreed to pay for the company in April.
Positively for Twitter this week, a Delaware judge agreed to fast-track its lawsuit against Mr. Musk, ordering a five-day trial in October. That is good news because, left to his own devices, Mr. Musk seems motivated to drag things out as long as possible, ultimately forcing Twitter into a settlement as legal expenses mount and its business deteriorates.
That is happening more quickly than believed based on Friday morning's update. The best-case scenario between now and October is a stock that manages to tread water as social-media companies risk drowning. As of Friday, shares of Twitter's fellow social-media players Snap, Meta Platforms and Pinterest were down an average of about 60% this year to Twitter's less than 8% decline.
That implies a lot of downside for a business that seems to be performing worse than all of them. Oddly, Twitter declined to write a shareholder letter or host a conference call at a time when it has a lot of explaining to do. If it loses Mr. Musk, it will desperately need its remaining investors' buy-in to keep its stock afloat.
Mr. Musk's focus, bots and spam, are less-consequential than other challenges the company faces. Pre-Musk, Twitter was working toward three goals to right its flailing business by the end of next year: surpassing $7.5 billion in annual revenue, reaching 315 million daily users and doubling the pace at which it produces new technology. Wall Street isn't currently forecasting Twitter will meet its revenue or its user goal by that point.
As for new technology, Twitter's results thus far this year don't indicate advertisers are all that excited about what has already been rolled out. Features on the consumer side don't look any better: Sensor Tower estimates the company's subscription platform, Twitter Blue, as well as Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces, have helped yield a grand total of just $3.7 million in worldwide consumer spending on Twitter's mobile app since early June 2021. So much for compelling secondary sources of revenue.
Unlike some of its competitors, Twitter isn't as threatened by a pullback in advertising. As of the fourth quarter of last year, company disclosures implied only about 15% of its ads were direct response, or those meant to elicit immediate clicks or purchases. In a cash-starved market, these types of ads are quick to be cut from advertisers' budgets. But, given new tracking restrictions, they offer the best way for social-media platforms to demonstrate return on advertisers' investments. That means that, over the long term, the platforms that can offer them in size will likely be the most valuable.
Who exactly is taking ownership for these issues? One of the few things Twitter did do in its scant earnings release was blame both the economy and Mr. Musk for its poor performance. Meanwhile, its possible new owner hasn't mentioned Twitter on Twitter for nearly two weeks. He seems to have moved back on to the potential of Tesla . . . and Mars.
It might be time for investors to consider moving on, too.

323,24-Jul-22,The Times - Tribune,Elon Musk and Twitter — Point/counterpoint,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2715448768/BFD812D457A14912PQ/641?accountid=13946,"We’ve all had buyer’s remorse, but few people ever find themselves regretting a 44-billion-dollar purchase. Since Elon Musk agreed to buy Twitter at a substantial premium in April, the stock market has tumbled, with tech stocks among the worst hit. Twitter now seems much less valuable. And for Musk, borrowing against Tesla stock to pay for the company is much more expensive.
Although Musk has good financial reasons to renegotiate his acquisition of Twitter, he can’t void the purchase agreement by pleading poor market timing. Musk faces an uphill battle against Twitter in court to get out of the deal.
In his rush to acquire Twitter, Musk left himself little legal room to maneuver. He argues that his exit is justified by inaccurate spambot numbers and Twitter’s failure to provide certain information about spambot calculations. Neither argument seems supported by the available evidence or, more important, relevant to the contract Musk signed.
Musk says he is walking away because Twitter misrepresented the percentage of its daily monetizable active users, or dMAUs, that are bots or spam accounts. For years, Twitter represented that bots made up less than 5 percent of its dMAUs, though it qualified the percentage as an estimate. Whether or not he agreed with it, Musk accepted this number when committing to buy Twitter.
Indeed, Musk made Twitter’s bot problems — an issue more visible to power users like himself — a focus of his acquisition effort. When discussing his bid at TedX Vancouver in April, he said, “A top priority I would have is eliminating the spam and scam bots and the bot armies that are on Twitter.” He later tweeted, “If our Twitter bid succeeds, we will defeat the spam bots or die trying!”
To the extent they are a problem, spambots were something Musk was aware of and ostensibly planned to solve. These statements make Musk’s efforts to recast bots as a reason to terminate the deal unpersuasive. Thus far, Musk has criticized Twitter’s bot measurement methodology but has shown no real evidence of its inaccuracy.
In any case, the deal is not contingent on accurate bot counts — even if Twitter’s dMAU numbers are inaccurate, their inaccuracy would have to have a “materially adverse effect” on Twitter’s business to give Musk any potential out.
The agreement requires Twitter to provide Musk with “information concerning its business, properties and personnel” for “any reasonable business purpose related to the consummation” of the deal. Musk claims that Twitter has failed to do so. In his apparent efforts to learn more about how dMAU numbers are calculated, Musk requested not just internal bot reports and metrics but also records of texts and emails about bots and Twitter’s financial models for the deal.
By asking for more information than Twitter is willing to provide, Musk may be able to contrive a legally adequate justification for walking away — but these requests could simply be deemed unreasonable or unrelated to the deal.
Musk’s agreement with Twitter includes a billion-dollar break-up fee (pocket change for Musk) and a specific performance clause. The clause allows Twitter to sue to force Musk to fulfill the terms of the contract and purchase the company for $54.20 a share. When Musk announced the deal was off in early July, Twitter sued for specific performance.
Now, the Delaware Chancery Court must decide if the contract Musk signed and his behavior since entitle Twitter to this remedy. Twitter argues that it has a contractual right to specific performance and that because Musk breached the contract by publicly denigrating Twitter, he lost any termination options he might have had. The court will consider Musk’s claim that he legitimately terminated the deal because errors in Twitter’s dMAU measurement would have a “materially adverse effect” on the business, and his requests for information weren’t met.
Although the suit boils down to a contract dispute, it has much wider implications.
For Twitter shareholders and its board, being bought out at $54.20 is preferable to owning Twitter at its current price of $38 a share or whatever price it might fall to were Musk’s offer to go away. They are the ones suing Musk, but they are not the only ones who care about what happens to Twitter.
Musk’s high-profile battle to acquire — and now to avoid acquiring — Twitter should serve as a reminder of the downsides of centralized social media. Twitter occupies a central place in American political discourse. Unlike other platforms, it is largely open by default — tweets are not limited to friends or groups — so it is a place where the everyman and members of Congress can rub shoulders or shout at one another. As a result, Twitter’s rules have become the subject of political conflict.
Musk’s purchase has been seen as everything from a solution to mismanagement and overbearing content moderation to the capture of vital communications infrastructure by a rogue billionaire. In reality, if Musk comes to own Twitter, both imagined extremes will be tempered by the need to maintain profitability.
Ultimately, this range of concerns militates in favor of decentralization. Reasonable users will always disagree about how to set and enforce platform rules. Many platform governance decisions are simply tradeoffs — ridding Twitter of bots would probably require a level of user verification that would discourage anonymous speech. The more users can decide how the content they see is selected and whom they interact with, the less who owns Twitter matters.
Whether the deal goes through or not, the last thing this dispute, or social media, needs is a political solution. Whatever the court’s judgment, it will be limited to the parties involved and won’t affect other social media platforms. Even with Elon Musk involved, Delaware corporate law and precedent provide a more stable mechanism for passing the torch than a seesaw of partisan speech regulations or punitive antitrust enforcement.

Counterpoint: What Twitter Needs Is Leadership
By Will Rinehart
InsideSources.com
Elon Musk wants out of the $44 billion deal he struck with Twitter, or so it seems. The easy and possibly less expensive option would be to pay the $1 billion exit fee written into the contract. Instead, he’s letting Twitter take him to court. Pay close attention to what happens in the coming weeks because this is undoubtedly not the end of the story between Musk and Twitter.
Musk’s behavior seems erratic, but at this juncture, he probably wants to exercise the option of time. He wants to stall.
Back in April, Musk made a formal offer for Twitter. Then in May, Musk’s tenor began to change. Spam bots and fake content were far more widespread than he was led to believe. He wrote, “20% fake/spam accounts, while 4 times what Twitter claims, could be much higher. My offer was based on Twitter’s SEC filings being accurate.”
Through May and into all of June, Musk took to the platform to criticize it. He continued to press Twitter for its fake content and spam accounts.
Then, earlier this month, Musk filed the paperwork to cancel the deal. According to Musk, the company “made false and misleading representations upon which Mr. Musk relied when entering into the Merger Agreement.”
But Twitter’s leadership is not having any of it. They are committed to finalizing the deal, and last week they fired back with an extended letter, which puts the issue in the courts.
It seems odd that Musk made a legitimate offer in April but now wants out. Even more confusing is the option he didn’t take.
Musk could have gotten out of this pickle by formally calling off the deal entirely, taking the loss. But it wouldn’t be cheap. As stipulated in the original agreement, Musk would have had to pay a $1 billion breakup fee.
Musk is trying to negate the entire deal by claiming that Twitter misled him. In particular, he has needled the company on their spam and fake accounts claims. In legal jargon, their misstatements will adversely affect the company’s value going forward.
Unfortunately for Musk, the standard is high for these cases, which means Musk isn’t likely to win. But there still might be something to his claim.
Every day, a group within Twitter selects 100 random accounts and reviews them to see if they are bots. Musk wants access to the raw data, which Twitter has yet to release.
Still, if the spam and fake accounts were a problem, Musk should have gotten it sorted before a formal deal was inked. This is why lawyers go into rooms with other lawyers and hash out the specifics of a deal before it is announced. At this point, it is probably too late.
In all likelihood, Musk will have to go through with the sale. So, the move to strike the deal is probably a stalling tactic. He might be able to get Twitter down in price in the next couple of months before the case is heard.
Musk laid out the problem when this all started: “Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy. What should be done?”
He then said that two paths were possible for Twitter. Either the company needed to be bought, or it needed a competitor. Musk was able to cobble together funding in just days, suggesting that there is investor appetite for another competitor in the space.
Musk has exposed the soft underbelly of social media.
Musk shows why the heavy hand of legislation isn’t needed regardless of what happens in court. What the company has always needed has been leadership.

324,25-Jul-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Tesla Records $170 Million Impairment Charge on Bitcoin; Securities filing show electric-car company also logged $64 million in gains from bitcoin sales,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2693709293/BFD812D457A14912PQ/143?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc. said it recorded a $170 million impairment charge against the carrying value of its bitcoin holdings for the first six months of the year.
The electric-car maker also logged $64 million in gains from certain sales of its bitcoin holdings, the company said in its 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday.
Because accounting rules define digital assets as indefinite-lived intangible assets , Tesla said it must recognize impairment charges to reflect any decrease in the fair value of cryptocurrencies held by the company below their carrying values.
""We may make no upward revisions for any market price increases until a sale,"" the company said. ""These charges may negatively impact our profitability in the periods in which such impairments occur even if the overall market values of these assets increase.""
Elon Musk in the Spotlight
Last week, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said the company sold $936 million worth of bitcoin in the second quarter to maximize its cash position as it dealt with the closure of its Shanghai factory due to local Covid-19 lockdowns. The company has unloaded around 75% of its $1.5 billion initial position in the cryptocurrency, leaving it with about $218 million worth of digital assets as of the end of June. The company made its bitcoin purchase in the first quarter of 2021.
""We are certainly open to increasing our bitcoin holdings in future, so this should not be taken as some verdict on bitcoin,"" Mr. Musk said on Tesla's quarterly earnings call . ""It's just that we were concerned about overall liquidity of the company given shutdowns in China, and we have not sold any of our dogecoin.""
Mr. Musk has been a vocal commentator on digital currencies. Tesla briefly accepted bitcoin as payment for its vehicles but suspended that policy in May 2021, citing concerns about the use of fossil fuels to mine bitcoin. Mr. Musk said at the time that Tesla wouldn't sell any bitcoin.
Tesla's filing didn't specify exactly when the company sold or began to sell its bitcoin holdings. In March, Mr. Musk tweeted that he wouldn't sell his personal holdings in bitcoin, ether or dogecoin.
The car maker, in the regulatory filing, also lifted its plans for spending on capital projects by about $1 billion for this year and the next two. Tesla said its capital expenditure now is expected to be between $6 billion and $8 billion in each of those years. The company is rapidly expanding to keep up with strong demand and this year added two new car plants—near Austin, Texas, and Berlin. Mr. Musk has called the two plants ""gigantic money furnaces,"" while adding the company would resolve ramp-up challenges there.
Tesla also disclosed it had received a new request for information from the SEC in June related to the company's compliance with a court-ordered settlement requiring certain of Mr. Musk's tweets be preapproved. The SEC sent Tesla a similar information request in November.
In a different matter, Tesla said the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in June came to similar conclusions as a California agency that sued the company in February, saying the company had turned a blind eye to years of complaints from Black factory workers . Tesla plans to begin settlement talks with the EEOC, the company said.
A spokesman for the federal agency, which is responsible for enforcing antidiscrimination laws , declined to comment on the agency's findings.

325,26-Jul-22,Philadelphia Tribune,Big Tech's recession fears spook other industries,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2698713315/BFD812D457A14912PQ/560?accountid=13946,"Big Tech is bracing for an economic recession and an uncertain future. That, in turn, is triggering more economic angst.
The biggest tech firms, most of whom report quarterly earnings this week, have offered recent hints they are hunkering down. News of layoffs and hiring slowdowns have become commonplace across Silicon Valley. Start-ups are saying capital is drying up. Workers are being put on notice that businesses are changing.
Meanwhile, Twitter's protracted bad romance with Elon Musk is tangled up in court and the outcome is uncertain, a point the company made as it reported disappointing numbers Friday. Amazon is facing a growing labor movement, and Facebook is facing a new advertising climate. Regulators domestically and abroad are threatening to crack down on the industry as a whole.
Social media company Snap's stock fell nearly 40% Friday, the day after it reported worse-than-expected revenue growth and declined to give a prediction for future profit because of ""uncertainties related to the operating environment."" Netflix last week reiterated factors such as ""sluggish economy growth"" as it lost subscribers.
And analysts are predicting this week's numbers released by Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Apple could be the starkest signal yet of how these companies will approach the coming months. Already last week, Bloomberg reported on a hiring and spending slowdown at Apple - a gauge for how much consumers are willing to spend - news that helped to propel the major stock market indexes lower.
""The market looks at that, and basically the logic is, 'oh crap, if they're doing this then what about the ones aren't as strong?""' said Tom Essaye, president of Sevens Report Research. ""'And what are they seeing coming that everyone else isn't?""'
Meta spokesman Tracy Clayton said the company would continue to make changes to some parts of its business because of the larger economic environment. Apple and Amazon did not respond to requests for comment. Google, Twitter and Snap declined to comment. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.
Tech's hiring freezes and pbssimistic predictions stand in stark contrast to the companies' traditionally bulletproof reputations for untrammeled growth, prompting concerns from some economists and Wall Street investors. For the last decade, tech companies have soared, hiring tens of thousands of workers and amassing huge cash hoards through ever-growing profits. The share prices of firms like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Google kept marching skyward, dominating stock exchanges and making many investors rich.
As some of the most valuable companies in the world, they also wield outsize influence on perceptions of the economy, in part because of the nature of their businesses/which relies on consumer clicks and spending. Any downturn in demand for toilet paper sold by Amazon, Teslas or iPhones, as well as fewer ads bought on Instagram or Google search to try to sell people new shoes or headphones, is sure to create jitters in other spheres.
Tech has been signaling to investors for months that the boom times are ending - Amazon was one of the first tech giants to warn earlier this year that it had hired too many warehouse workers and had overbuilt anticipating higher customer demand that instead began to wane as coronavirus lockdowns were lifted and habits shifted out of pandemic modes.
Tesla reported better-than-expected earnings on Wednesday, but even during that call, CEO Elon Musk and other executives were grilled by analysts on the topic of a potential economic downturn. Musk said earlier this summer that he had a ""super bad feeling"" about the economy, and expected the automaker to reduce its salaried workers by about 10%.
""We need to be more entrepreneurial, working with greater urgency, sharper focus and more hunger than we've shown on sunnier days,"" Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google-parent Alphabet said in a memo to employees the week before last. The companywill cut its frantic pace of hiring and new employees will be concentrated in engineering and other technical roles, he said. ""Making the company more efficient is up to all of us.""
Earlier this year, Facebook for the first time reported a decline of daily users, which combined with increased competition, a lower revenue forecast and advertising business hurdles sent its stock prices plummeting. The company's stock is now down 50% for the year. And Facebook last week told its engineering managers to weed out low-performing employees in the face of a downturn. ""If a direct report is coasting or is a low performer, they are not who we need; they are failing this company,"" the company's head of engineering wrote in a memo.
Microsoft recently removed open job listings from online, Bloomberg reported.
It can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, market experts say, if other companies immediately react to Big Tech's buckling down by tightening their own businesses. But the moves aren't cut and dry - many feel tech is preparing for an economic downturn, not panicking because of plummeting business metrics.
""You have some that view it as a positive because companies are getting more disciplined,"" said Kristina Hooper, the chief global market strategist at Invesco.
Big Tech was also more successful during the pandemic than many industries, giving them more room to fall.
""It didn't shed as much labor in the pandemic, so it didn't have the same shortages coming out,"" said Harvard economics professor Jason Furman. ""So in some ways, it's not a surprise that as the economy looks like it's headed into a rougher patch that they need to recalibrate.""
And, despite widely expected poor numbers this week, many of the companies have already driven down expectations so much that earnings may not be as bad as feared, the analysts said.
Smaller tech firms have been sounding the alarm for months, with new venture capital investments slowing and many startups announcing layoffs through the spring and early summer.
Other economic indicators are giving a mixed picture of where exactly the economy is headed. Americans are pessimistic about high prices, but they're still spending their money. The pace of new hiring isn't as fast as it was a few months ago, but it's still far from petering out completely. Some economists and financial analysts still predict a recession later this year or in 2023, though that doesn't mean it will be as painful as the one that followed the 2008 financial crisis.
Some of the cuts in the tech industry have been a long time coming, with new investment money too freely available for so long that some companies became bloated with resources they didn't necessarily need, said Doug Clinton, managing partner of tech investment firm Loup Ventures.
""When the world changes and capital gets tighter, everybody's kind of looking and saying, 'we may not need as big of a staff as we thought,""' Clinton said. ""We were kind of in the boom times, now we're coming down the roller coaster into the tougher times.""

326,30-Jul-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",EXCHANGE --- Business News: Musk Files Response to Twitter Suit,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2696371274/BFD812D457A14912PQ/578?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk formally responded to Twitter Inc.'s lawsuit seeking to force him to go through with his $44 billion takeover of the social-media platform and included counterclaims against the company. The filing Friday was made confidentially and isn't viewable by the public.
It isn't unusual for counterclaims against a public company to be filed confidentially, pending review for possible redactions of sensitive information. The response and claims may be available as soon as next week.
One of the counterclaims by Mr. Musk is expected to center on the allegation that Twitter changed its number of monetizable daily active users shortly after agreeing to the deal, and then didn't provide thorough responses to requests by Mr. Musk's team for data on the spam number, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Musk's response includes a reference to the Warren Buffett quote: ""Only when the tide goes out do you discover who's been swimming naked,"" the people said, a suggestion by Mr. Musk that Twitter has been obfuscating about spam and fake accounts because it knew the market downturn could reveal its weaknesses.
While Mr. Musk's answer and counterclaims to Twitter's lawsuit aren't immediately accessible, the billionaire chief executive officer of Tesla Inc. has been vocal about his reasons for wanting to walk away from the deal and indicated in previous regulatory and court filings how he may try to make his case for terminating the merger agreement. Mr. Musk's response Friday was filed hours after the judge overseeing the lawsuit against Mr. Musk set the week of Oct. 17 for a 5-day trial.
Mr. Musk said in a regulatory filing this month that he wanted out of the deal primarily because Twitter hadn't provided the data and information he needs to assess the prevalence of fake or spam accounts.
Twitter rejected that assertion and argued that Mr. Musk hasn't adhered to the deal terms, including violating a nondisclosure agreement and then bragging about it on Twitter. The social-media company sued Mr. Musk on July 12 in Delaware Chancery Court, seeking to enforce the terms of the transaction.
In the regulatory filing to end the deal, Mr. Musk's lawyer cited concerns over Twitter's estimates about how many of its daily users are fake or spam accounts, an issue the billionaire had raised as a concern about the deal almost three weeks after he signed it.
The company has said for years that it estimates fewer than 5% of its monetizable daily active users are spam and fake accounts, a figure Mr. Musk has disputed.
In a July 18 court filing opposing a request by Twitter for an expedited trial, Mr. Musk for the first time laid out publicly a clear timeline around his concerns over data about fake and spam accounts, and included new claims about Twitter's level of cooperation on the issue.
He said his team first became concerned about the company's user numbers after it disclosed in its April earnings report that it had overstated its user base for nearly three years through the end of 2021 because of an error in how it accounted for people linked to multiple accounts. The revision reduced the number of its monetizable daily active users by 0.9% for the fourth quarter of last year. The company last week said it averaged 237.8 million of such users in the most recent quarter.
Twitter said in its suit against Mr. Musk that his attempt to abandon the transaction reflects souring market conditions that resulted in his personal wealth declining by more than $100 billion from its November 2021 peak.

327,1-Aug-22,The New York Observer,Elon Musk’s Personal Image Crisis Has Become a Burden to Tesla Owners,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2696966246/BFD812D457A14912PQ/35?accountid=13946,"Prospective Tesla buyers are put off by Elon Musk’s controversial personal image. Getty Images for The Met Museum/
Tesla doesn’t have an advertising or media department because it doesn’t need one. Its founder and CEO Elon Musk is a way more effective brand ambassador for the electric carmaker than any celebrity spokesperson or marketing campaign. But that advantage is now on the verge of backfiring, it seems, as Musk’s chaotic personal life and public antics are putting off prospective Tesla buyers as well as some existing owners, several recent consumer surveys find.
In just the past three months, approval rating of Musk’s image has dropped, according to a poll led by Civic Science, a market research firm that surveyed about 8,000 consumers in the U.S. between mid-April and mid-July. In April, 54 percent of Americans polled viewed Musk positively and 46 percent negatively. By the end of July, that proportion had reversed, with 54 percent rated Musk as unfavorable.
The surveyed period was marked by several scandalous events involving Musk, including his on-again, off-again proposal to buy Twitter, a report accusing him of sexually harassing a SpaceX flight attendant a few years ago (which he denied), and the revelation that he fathered secret twins last year with a subordinate at work.
Earlier consumer studies suggest Musk’s appeal to the electric vehicle community had begun declining even before the latest scandals.
An April study conducted by Creative Strategies, a tech market research firm, found that some Tesla owners began to have “negative sentiment” toward the Tesla brand due to Elon Musk’s public actions, including his often inflammatory tweets.
A similar survey, published a year earlier by market researcher Escalent, found that electric vehicle shoppers viewed Musk as the most negative aspect of the Tesla brand. “When we talk to Tesla owners, it’s not an uncommon refrain to hear them say, ‘You know, I really get to think of defending my purchase because Elon has made another tweet and it’s obnoxious,'” said Mike Dovorany, then vice president of Escalent’s automotive and mobility group, during a webinar in March 2021.
Civic Science
Elon Musk’s deteriorating personal image may hurt Tesla sales
As electric vehicles go mainstream and more carmakers enter this market, buyers have more options, and those who choose Tesla are not necessarily the early adopters who were more often than not ardent Musk fans.
“What we heard from the community was a feeling of being put off by Elon Musk, but very few said they were not going to buy a Tesla ever again,” said Ben Bajarin, CEO of Creative Strategies who led the consumer study in April. “But now it seems competition is catching up in many ways. As viable alternatives to Tesla emerge, Musk may need to be more attentive to how his public persona is coming off to the greater audience and whether that will impact sales going forward.”
“I was a total Musk fanboy. [But] over time, his public statements have really come to bother me. He acts like a seven-year-old,” Dennis Levitt, a Los Angeles-based Tesla owner, told Bloomberg in a recent interview.
“I am a [Tesla] shareholder and Cybertruck pre-orderer. He has been scaring the beJesus out of me,” wrote a Twitter user who describes himself as an Elon Musk fan. “He teases us last week by saying that he would keep his head down,—that lasted a glorious few hours and got right back into the mix. Ugh.”"
328,3-Aug-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"What Twitter's Subpoenas to Elon Musk's Inner Circle Could Yield; Social-media company's legal team seeks communications from Tesla CEO's financial backers, investors and friends",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2697480855/BFD812D457A14912PQ/166?accountid=13946,"Twitter Inc. is seeking records from several of Elon Musk's circle of Silicon Valley investors, friends and financial backers as the company looks to build its case against the Tesla Inc. chief executive over his stalled $44 billion takeover.
Twitter wants any communication from those people related to the deal. The goal is likely to be to determine whether Mr. Musk had other concerns about completing his agreement to buy the company, beyond what he has said publicly, according to lawyers and academics not involved in the case.
It is standard in such merger disputes to seek information from financial institutions backing the stalled deal. But lawyers and academics say that because Mr. Musk was acquiring the company as an individual, those close to him, including friends and advisers, are fair game as potential sources of information about his intentions.
""A single email could be decisive, increasing the chances of winning,"" said Stephen Gillers, a professor at New York University School of Law.
The subpoenas requested information and documents, including face-to-face conversations, physical mail, emails, text messages, instant messages, social-media contacts, facsimiles and phone conversations, according to court documents.
Those who received notices include venture investor Steve Jurvetson, an early Tesla investor who once served on the auto maker's board, and Marc Andreessen, whose venture firm Andreessen Horowitz committed $800 million to Mr. Musk's takeover . Entrepreneur David Sacks noted his subpoena on Twitter, posting an image of a middle finger. Mr. Sacks is among a close-knit group of activists and businessmen who encouraged Mr. Musk to get involved in Twitter , according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Sacks declined to comment on the subpoena. Messrs. Jurvetson and Andreessen didn't respond to a request for comment.
Venture-capital investor Joe Lonsdale also noted his subpoena on Twitter and called it ""a giant harassing fishing expedition."" Mr. Lonsdale said he had nothing to do with the Twitter-Musk situation ""aside from a few snarky comments."" He didn't respond to a request for comment.
Twitter alleges in its lawsuit that Mr. Musk violated their merger agreement by misusing confidential information, disparaging the company and failing to make efforts to consummate the transaction. Twitter's lawyers are expected to point to tweets that Mr. Musk posted and to leverage data and communications from the subpoena process, legal experts say.
""They are fishing for anything they can to discredit his claims through whatever he told friends, colleagues and investors,"" said Charles Elson, a corporate-governance professor at the University of Delaware.
Twitter declined to comment on the subpoenas or its legal strategy. The five-day trial is scheduled to start Oct. 17 in Delaware Chancery Court.

Mr. Musk has cited doubts about Twitter's counting of fake and spam accounts for why he wants to walk away. He has said Twitter didn't provide the necessary data and information he needs to assess the prevalence of such accounts and raised questions about Twitter's methods.
Twitter said in court filings that it provided Mr. Musk with the information he requested. The company has long estimated that fewer than 5% of its monetizable daily users represent fake accounts. Mr. Musk said the number is probably much higher, closer to 20%.
Mr. Musk's attorneys didn't respond to requests for comment on the subpoenas or their legal strategy. Mr. Musk officially responded to Twitter's lawsuit last week and included counterclaims, but the full details aren't known yet because they are sealed while Twitter reviews them for any sensitive information.
Twitter also sent subpoenas to at least a dozen banks including Deutsche Bank AG, seeking information on equity and debt financing and communications around the deal. A bank spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment.

Banks and investors are usually called upon to provide documentation about transactions, but the broader inner circle isn't as typical, said Brian Quinn, who teaches about mergers and acquisitions at Boston College Law School.
Legal filings from Twitter show that the company is asking, among other things, for any documents and communications relating to fake or spam accounts—which Mr. Musk has referred to as bots.
""They will look for details about roles the bots played. Are they just a convenient hook?"" Mr. Quinn said. ""What they suspect is that Musk got cold feet.""
Observers say the company is looking for communication that would support its argument that Mr. Musk is balking because he lost more than $100 billion of his wealth amid the market downturn. Mr. Musk pledged as much as $33 billion of his own money toward the deal.
Twitter also might be trying with the flurry of subpoenas to retrace Mr. Musk's steps since he agreed to the deal, to show he didn't put in reasonable effort to complete it, said William Newman, a senior counsel at a New York litigation firm.
Twitter has lost billions in market value since Mr. Musk unveiled his all-cash offer to buy the platform on April 25. Twitter shares closed at $40.98 Tuesday, a discount of 24% to Mr. Musk's offer price of $54.20 a share.

329,4-Aug-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk Suggests Big Tesla Factory Expansion Plans; Tesla shareholders clear path to 3-for-1 stock split, according to preliminary tally of votes",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2697604098/BFD812D457A14912PQ/13?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk said Thursday that the electric-vehicle maker, which is striving to sell 20 million vehicles annually, could ultimately build 10 or 12 factories.
An announcement about Tesla's next factory location could come later this year, he said at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting. Mr. Musk didn't say whether the factory count he forecast includes existing facilities such as the company's four existing car plants.
At the event, Tesla shareholders cleared the way Thursday for the company to complete its second stock split in about two years, based on a preliminary vote count.
Tesla, whose stock price has roughly tripled in the past two years, is planning a 3-for-1 stock split that the company has said is designed to make ownership more accessible to employees and individual investors. Tesla needed shareholders to sign off on issuing the new shares to complete the split. The move wouldn't affect the company's market value, which topped $960 billion as of Thursday.
That proposal was among more than a dozen facing investor consideration at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting, held at the company's Austin, Texas-area factory.
The gathering followed a recent rally in Tesla's stock price after the company reported second-quarter earnings that were better than expected. Tesla generated $2.3 billion in profit for the period, ahead of Wall Street's expectations but below its record quarterly profit of $3.3 billion in the first three months of the year.
An extended shutdown at Tesla's Shanghai assembly plant, paired with global supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages weighed on results.
Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn said on the company's July earnings call that Tesla was still aiming for 50% vehicle-delivery growth this year over 2021, though he acknowledged that reaching that target had become more difficult.
The investor gathering spotlighted concerns that some shareholders have expressed about Tesla's corporate governance. Several of the nonbinding proposals dealt with employment issues, from corporate efforts to prevent harassment and discrimination to how mandatory arbitration affects Tesla's employees and workplace culture. A preliminary tally indicated those measures didn't receive the requisite votes.
The company is facing scrutiny from state and federal employment authorities over issues including alleged racial discrimination and harassment at its Fremont, Calif., assembly plant. The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing sued Tesla in February, saying that Black workers routinely heard supervisors using racial slurs and were confronted with racist graffiti in the factory. Tesla has alleged misconduct by the California agency and said it is seeking dismissal of the case.
In June, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reached conclusions similar to those of the California employment agency, Tesla said in a securities filing, adding that it planned to begin settlement talks with federal officials.
Shareholders also backed the proposed re-election of the Tesla directors Ira Ehrenpreis and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, who have served on the board since 2007 and 2018, respectively.
The proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services had urged investors to vote against their re-election, citing concern about the board's risk oversight and Tesla's response to a measure that shareholders approved last year. That nonbinding proposal called on Tesla to cut board members' terms to one year, from three.
Instead, Tesla asked shareholders to reduce directors' terms to two years. Such a proposal failed to gain the requisite votes last year or in 2019 and failed again this year.
Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison, who joined the board in 2018, didn't stand for re-election, meaning Tesla's board is poised to shrink to seven members, from eight.

Musk's legal team had hoped details of his answer to the action and counterclaims could be made public Wednesday, but ABC News reported a judge in Delaware, has allowed Twitter's attorneys more time to go through Musk's sealed findings to potentially redact any commercially sensitive information and data.
It said Judge Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick had agreed to Twitter's request, and that the public filing should be made public by latest 5 p.m. Friday. It is possible the filing could be made earlier if Twitter's attorneys complete the review sooner.
In April Musk, chief executive of Tesla (TSLA) proposed an all-cash offer to buy Twitter (ticker: TWTR), but after months of wrangling he backed out , arguing he had requested more information on the number of fake accounts on the platform, which Musk said was material to the deal.
Twitter's has lost billions in market value since April. Details of Musk's arguments, in what will be one of the most closely watched lawsuits of recent years, will give some clues as to the strength of the case and likelihood of Twitter's success in forcing through the sale.

Mr. Musk said Tesla is aiming to produce 1.5 million to 2 million vehicles a year at most of its factories. Tesla recently produced its 3 millionth vehicle, and Mr. Musk said 100 million could be on the road in 10 years.
The company said last month that it has the capacity to make more than 1.9 million vehicles annually across its four assembly plants.
Tesla plans to increase capital spending and may repurchase its own shares, Mr. Musk said, adding he didn't want to commit to a buyback.
The Tesla meeting unfolded as Mr. Musk is embroiled in a legal battle with Twitter Inc. over his attempt to walk away from a $44 billion takeover of the company. Mr. Musk largely sidestepped the topic at the Tesla event, though said, ""I do understand the product quite well, so I think I've got a good sense of where to point the engineering team at Twitter to make it radically better."" Twitter is suing Mr. Musk to go through with the transaction.
The investor gathering also spotlighted concerns that some shareholders have expressed about Tesla's corporate governance. Several of the nonbinding proposals dealt with employment issues, from corporate efforts to prevent harassment and discrimination to how mandatory arbitration affects Tesla's employees and workplace culture.

It will allow large shareholders to nominate alternate members of the board of directors, a common practice among large corporations. Tesla has often faced criticism that its board lacks diversity and people willing to stand up to Mr. Musk.Proposals required a two-thirds majority to be adopted. The company did not announce vote tallies Thursday at the company's factory in Austin, Texas, saying it will provide results in the coming days.Tesla is widely credited with pioneering the market for electric cars and putting the auto industry on a path to greatly reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. But the company has been accused of racial discrimination at its California factory and of union busting, and it has been criticized for having a board stacked with people who are close to Mr. Musk. In May, Standard & Poor's removed Tesla from the S&P 500 ESG Index, a listing of companies that meet certain environmental, social and governance standards.""No one doubts the seismic historic achievements that Tesla and Musk have made,"" Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, said before the meeting started. But he said investors were concerned about Mr. Musk's aborted bid for Twitter, growing competition in the electric vehicle market and production problems at Tesla.""Musk has had a magic carpet ride, but you're starting to see some frustration among investors,"" Mr. Ives said.In recent years, activist shareholders have been trying harder to change the behavior of Tesla and other companies, in some cases with support from big investors like BlackRock and Vanguard. But that movement has led to a backlash by conservative lawmakers and some corporate executives. In May, Mr. Musk called E.S.G. ""an outrageous scam.""Last year, Tesla faced five proposals from activist investors, all of which lost.Tesla management opposed all eight resolutions presented on Thursday. A proposal by the board for a three-to-one stock split won support from shareholders, and will make Tesla shares, which currently trade at more than $900, easier for individuals and employees to buy.The shareholder resolutions included a measure that asked Tesla to disclose more information about whether its government lobbying aligns with efforts to limit climate change. ""Tesla is a notable laggard when it comes to environmental, social, and governance-related disclosure,"" said the resolution, which was submitted by the Nathan Cummings Foundation and the Green Century Equity Fund.The New York State Common Retirement Fund, which manages the pension plan for state employees, filed a resolution asking management to file an annual report on its efforts to prevent racial discrimination and sexual harassment. The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing sued Tesla in February after receiving what it said were hundreds of complaints from employees who said they were subject to racial slurs, assigned physically arduous work and denied transfers and promotions.In a response to the resolution, Tesla said it did ""not tolerate discrimination, harassment, retaliation or any mistreatment of employees in the workplace or work-related situations.""Mr. Musk did not directly address the shareholder criticism when he spoke after the official part of the meeting had ended. Instead, he announced that Tesla had recently produced its three millionth vehicle and had become solidly profitable. Just 10 years ago, he said, Tesla produced only a few thousand cars and was given little chance of survival.""I think it's going to go up from here,"" he said.Tesla maintains that its mission is ""to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy."" But shareholders have become increasingly critical of other aspects of the company's and Mr. Musk's behavior.Several shareholder proposals were endorsed by Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises large investors on how to vote at annual meetings. That included the proposal allowing shareholders to nominate alternate candidates to the board.Tesla has often faced criticism that its board, whose members include Kimbal Musk, Elon Musk's brother, has been unable to restrain the chief executive from doing or saying things that damage the automaker.In a response, Tesla said that it had added more independent directors in recent years and that allowing shareholders to nominate members ""could be exploited by corporate raiders.""Shareholder proposals have received significant support in the past. Last year, 46 percent of shareholders voted in favor of a proposal challenging a Tesla policy that requires employees to resolve complaints of discrimination and sexual harassment before an arbitrator rather than in court. The resolution was filed by Nia Impact Capital in Oakland, Calif.The New York chapter of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd filed a resolution this year asking Tesla to do more to ensure it is not using cobalt mined by children to mine cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Kristin Hull, the chief executive of Nia Impact Capital, said activist investment firms like hers were taking the lead in confronting Tesla management while big institutional shareholders, with far more clout, had stayed in the background.""It's the smaller asset managers and women-led asset managers and the nuns that are leading this,"" Dr. Hull said. The big shareholders, she said, ""just have to pick up the phone.""PhotographTesla shareholders have been critical of the company's and Elon Musk's behavior.

333,5-Aug-22,Republican & Herald,Musk Says Twitter Committed Fraud in Dispute Over Fake Accounts,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2699165250/BFD812D457A14912PQ/475?accountid=13946,"Twitter has accused Elon Musk, in a lawsuit, of abandoning his planned acquisition of the company because stock market turbulence made the deal more difficult for him. But firing back in a legal filing, Musk said it was Twitter that torpedoed the $44 billion acquisition.
Musk argued that Twitter concealed the true number of inauthentic accounts on its platform, accusing the company of fraud. Such accounts made up at least 10% of Twitter’s daily active users who see ads, Musk’s legal team asserted, reiterating worries that he expressed shortly after signing the deal in April. Twitter has maintained that the figure is less than 5%.
Twitter also hid the number of its users who see ads, lawyers for Musk said in the filing, which was made public Thursday. During the first quarter of the year, 65 million of the company’s 229 million daily active users did not see ads, according to the filing.
Twitter said Musk was trying “to distort data received from Twitter to sponsor wild conclusions” and that its figures were accurate.
Using Botometer, a tool designed by Indiana University to measure inauthentic accounts, analysts for Musk found higher numbers of inauthentic accounts than Twitter had disclosed, according to the filing. Their analysis was preliminary and will be expanded, the filing said.
The misrepresentations hid weaknesses in Twitter’s business model and tricked Musk into agreeing to buy Twitter at “an inflated price,” lawyers for the Tesla executive said.
“Twitter was miscounting the number of false and spam accounts on its platform, as part of its scheme to mislead investors about the company’s prospects,” lawyers for Musk wrote. “Twitter’s disclosures have slowly unraveled, with Twitter frantically closing the gates on information in a desperate bid to prevent the Musk parties from uncovering its fraud.”
The filing, made this past Friday but kept confidential until Thursday, was Musk’s first extensive response in what is expected to be a prolonged legal battle between the social media company and one of the richest people in the world. A trial is set for October.
“His claims are factually inaccurate, legally insufficient and commercially irrelevant,” Bret Taylor, chair of Twitter’s board, said in a statement Thursday. The company also responded to Musk’s claims in a legal filing.
The Botometer tool is unreliable, Twitter said in its filing. The company noted that the tool used different standards from Twitter’s internal calculations and had once deemed Musk’s Twitter account “highly likely to be a bot.”
Musk began snapping up shares of Twitter early this year and by April had become the company’s largest shareholder. He rejected Twitter’s offer to join its board, instead launching a swift and aggressive takeover attempt. But once Twitter agreed to the acquisition, Musk began to express doubts. In July, he indicated that he no longer wanted to buy the company.
Twitter sued Musk in Delaware Chancery Court in an attempt to force the acquisition through. Twitter has claimed he lost interest in the deal as the market slumped and shares in Twitter and the electric carmaker Tesla, which is the primary source of Musk’s wealth, declined.
“Musk refuses to honor his obligations to Twitter and its stockholders because the deal he signed no longer serves his personal interests,” Twitter said in its lawsuit.
Over the past few days, the company peppered Musk’s banks, financial partners and associates with subpoenas, demanding communications about the deal that could shed light on why Musk decided to walk away.
The deal includes a “specific performance” clause that allows Twitter to sue to force the deal through so long as the debt that the billionaire has corralled for the acquisition is in place. Musk may pay a $1 billion fee to exit the deal if his funding falls through.
Musk has maintained that Twitter is flooded with fake accounts and that the company has misled him about the true number of impostors on its platform. Fake accounts are used to spread spam or manipulate Twitter’s service by falsely amplifying trends, and are often automated rather than run by real people.
Twitter earns the bulk of its revenue from advertising. But Musk asserted that advertisers would not reach the customers they intended if Twitter was flooded with fake accounts. His lawyers argued that inaccuracies in Twitter’s user metrics amounted to a material adverse affect on the business, allowing him to abandon the acquisition.
Twitter said in a message to employees that was seen by The New York Times that it had chosen not to redact any of Musk’s claims because it was confident in its metrics. “We offer our customers a highly sophisticated set of tools and features to run and measure the effectiveness of their campaigns across our platform, with a foundation of transparency,” said Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel.
On Thursday, Musk continued to weigh in on how Twitter could change. “I do understand the product quite well, so I think I’ve got a good sense of where to point the engineering team at Twitter to make it radically better,” he said during a meeting of Tesla shareholders.

335,7-Aug-22,Telegraph - Herald,Musk says Twitter deal could move ahead with 'bot' info,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2699822127/BFD812D457A14912PQ/655?accountid=13946,"The Associated Press
Elon Musk said Saturday his planned $44 billion takeover of Twitter should move forward if the company can confirm some details about how it measures whether user accounts are 'spam bots' or real people.
The billionaire and Tesla CEO has been trying to back out of his April agreement to buy the social media company, leading Twitter to sue him last month to complete the acquisition. Musk countersued, accusing Twitter of misleading his team about the true size of its user base and other problems he said amounted to fraud and breach of contract.
Both sides are headed toward an October trial in a Delaware court.
""If Twitter simply provides their method of sampling 100 accounts and how they're confirmed to be real, the deal should proceed on original terms,"" Musk tweeted early Saturday. ""However, if it turns out that their SEC filings are materially false, then it should not.""
Twitter declined comment Saturday.
The company has repeatedly disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission an estimate that fewer than 5% of user accounts are fake or spam, with a disclaimer that it could be higher. Musk waived his right to further due diligence when he signed the April merger agreement.
Twitter has argued in court that Musk is deliberately trying to tank the deal because market conditions have deteriorated and the acquisition no longer serves his interests.
In a court filing Thursday, it describes his counterclaims as an imagined story ""contradicted by the evidence and common sense.""
""Musk invents representations Twitter never made and then tries to wield, selectively, the extensive confidential data Twitter provided him to conjure a breach of those purported representations,"" company attorneys wrote in the court filing."
336,10-Aug-22,Barron's (Online),Musk Sells Tesla Stock Once Again. It's the Risk of Paying Up for Twitter.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2700282528/BFD812D457A14912PQ/67?accountid=13946,"The cost-of-living crisis appears to have reached the world's richest man.
That's one spin on Elon Musk's fresh disposal of Tesla shares just in case he is forced to go ahead with his purchase of Twitter.
Having raised $6.9 billion this time, Musk said, ""it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock,"" and he's done with selling.
But he also drew a line in April , when he offloaded $8.5 billion of stock in the days after agreeing to buy Twitter for $44 billion.
Musk walked away from that deal last month and he won't be compelled to complete it unless the trial, due to start in mid-October, comes out in favor of Twitter.
That threat seems some way off to prompt a sale right now, but with a possible $33 billion equity element to the transaction, it pays to get organized.
Despite hopes to the contrary, his actions suggest a fear that the Twitter purchase will go ahead—or else it is a good moment to sell shares regardless. Since polling his Twitter followers in November, Musk has realized more than $30 billion from Tesla stock.
However, he makes clear he will increase his 15% Tesla holding if the Twitter deal does not close.
Either way, it's well-timed if today's CPI inflation data blows some froth off the tech sector. Tesla has appreciated by over 20% in a month and the Nasdaq Composite by 10%, despite some warning signs.
Memory chip maker Micron Technology said sales for the current quarter will come in no better than at the low end of guidance, which was cut by almost $2 billion only at the end of June. Chip makers Nvidia and Intel also have signaled concerns.
It appears to be no bad time for investors to take some money off the table—for whatever the reason.

Micron Also Warns on Outlook as Biden Signs Chip Law
Micron Technology became the second chip maker this week to warn about its sales outlook, cutting its fourth quarter guidance and saying it also expects substantial declines in first quarter revenue and margins. It expects to cut capital expenditures for fiscal 2023.
* The warning, a day after Nvidia warned of a slowdown, came as President Joe Biden signed a $280 billion technology spending bill that includes $52.7 billion to expand chip-making and a 25% investment tax credit to spur additional private investment.
* Micron is also promising to spend $40 billion on U.S. chip making, creating up to 40,000 jobs through the end of the decade. Micron said that will boost U.S. market share for memory chip production to 10% from less than 2% now.
* Qualcomm and GlobalFoundries are spending another $4.2 billion to expand GlobalFoundries' chip-making facility in upstate New York through 2028. The deal will help Qualcomm boost U.S. chip production as much as 50% over the next five years. GlobalFoundries' second quarter surpassed expectations.
* Total semiconductor industry capital spending is estimated to grow 24% this year, to $190 billion, according to IC Insights. Assuming some growth, the additional $52 billion in funding for the industry would be a modest increase over five years.
What's Next: The White House said the CHIPS law had provisions to ensure companies that get the funding don't build certain facilities in China or other countries of concern, or use taxpayer money to repurchase stock or issue shareholder dividends.

Coinbase Isn't Seeing an Immediate Comeback in Crypto
Coinbase isn't seeing a comeback in crypto, at least not yet, after losing more than $1 billion in the second quarter. The crypto exchange operator said revenue fell 64% as investors fled the market, and retail transaction revenue fell 66%.
* The company called the second quarter ""a test of durability for crypto companies,"" with dramatic market movements that forced users to shift their behavior. July trading volume showed a continuation of the trend, and third-quarter results could fall below the second quarter, it said.
* Coinbase now expects seven million to nine million monthly transacting users, down from a range of five million to 15 million three months ago. Average transaction revenue per user is expected to be in the low $20 range, rather than pre-2021 levels.
* The biggest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is a big part of what drew retail investors to trade on Coinbase and other exchanges. Bitcoin's price is up 20% since June after a big fall earlier this year and the bankruptcy filings of Voyager Digital and Celsius Network.
* Roblox, a platform where people can build virtual worlds, added daily active users from last year but the pace slipped from the first quarter . Its bookings, a measure of revenue, slipped 4% year over year.
What's Next: Some investors wonder if Bitcoin's resurgence in recent weeks means it has found a bottom. Crypto investing firm Galaxy Digital's CEO Mike Novogratz doesn't expect ""another shoe to fall"" in terms of bankruptcies, leaving investors looking for a new narrative to drive prices higher.

Berkshire Hathaway Builds Occidental Stake as Oil Prices Drop
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway now owns 20.2% of Occidental Petroleum after buying another $400 million of shares in the energy company in recent days, according to a regulatory filing. The growing investment has prompted speculation that Berkshire may be interested in buying the rest of the company.
* Berkshire has steadily built its stake in the domestic-focused oil and gas producer this year and now holds 188.4 million shares. Occidental's earnings have surged this year with oil and gas prices. Berkshire had no immediate comment.
* Oil companies have had record profit, but crude prices are falling. WTI is down about 27% from its multiyear peak in early March. GasBuddy said gasoline prices at the pump dropped below $4 a gallon nationwide, to an average $3.984 a gallon.
* But investors are still flocking to oil stocks for the cash the companies return to shareholders in dividends and stock buybacks. Many oil companies can still return more than 10% of their market values in cash to equity holders.
* A pipeline that carries Russian crude through Ukraine to refineries in Slovakia, Hungary, and the Czech Republic was stopped on Aug. 4 after a disagreement over payments from Russia's state-owned Transneft pipeline operator amid Western sanctions, The Wall Street Journal reported.
What's Next: Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy's head of petroleum analysis, expects gas prices to keep dropping for another few weeks, with some parts of the West Coast soon dipping below $5 a gallon. He noted that tropical storms could raise the risk of disruptions.

Norwegian Sees Q3 Loss Despite Rebound in Travel Demand
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings sees continued losses into the third quarter after second-quarter results lagged behind 2019 levels despite strong consumer demand. It cited a volatile macroeconomic environment, though occupancy is expected to rise to 80% from 65% in the second quarter.
* The cruise operator said fuel costs could affect earnings per share in the third quarter, and revenue is forecast to be between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. An easing up of Covid-19 health protocols could aid recovery, it said.
* Spirit Airlines reported a narrower loss and higher-than-expected revenue as leisure air travel bounced back. Fuel costs doubled to $4.30 a gallon, but are declining, MarketWatch reported.
* Wynn Resorts reported revenue that fell short of expectations, attributing the shortfall to Macau operations in China, which were subject to shutdowns to control the spread of Covid-19.
* Hyatt Hotels beat expectations, with revenue per available room up 82% worldwide and 85% in the U.S. Rivals Marriott International and Hilton Worldwide Holdings also offered upbeat outlooks.
What's Next: Hilton Worldwide expects adjusted earnings per share to be between $4.21 and $4.46 for the full year, higher than analysts expected. Hilton's management said it is confident about a continued recovery in 2022 travel.

Dear Quentin,
My son is 27 years old. He's very smart. He scored 32 on his ACT test without cracking the book. However, he can't manage life.
He has been living with his father and stepmother for the last few years in a house that they own. He pays half of the bills in the house, despite six adults living there. His stepmom has access to his bank account. She was caught embezzling from a local club a couple years ago.
I have offered to be a payee or power of attorney. But he says he can handle it on his own. I even suggested a six-month trial with me or someone else helping him out. I still have a little money left over from what I saved for him to attend college.
Could I offer it to him as an incentive to take the steps to financial independence? I am at a loss on how to help him. I am worried about his stepmom cleaning his account out. Should I talk to his dad? Any other suggestions?

 Musk Sells Tesla Stock Once Again. It's the Risk of Paying Up for Twitter. 
"
337,11-Aug-22,The Washington Post,"Before court date with Twitter, Musk raises billions by selling Tesla shares",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2700450888/BFD812D457A14912PQ/213?accountid=13946,"Move underscores
doubts that backing out
of deal can be done easily
Elon Musk has sold millions of Tesla shares in recent days, raising nearly $7 billion, to prepare for the possibility he might be forced to buy a company he no longer wants.
Recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings show Musk sold 7,924,107 shares of his electric vehicle company Friday through Tuesday, raising $6.9 billion. The move underscores doubts that Musk can seamlessly back out of a $44 billion deal to acquire Twitter and highlights the extent to which Tesla is being dragged into a high-stakes dispute between a leading social media company and the world's richest man.
Musk agreed to buy the company in April then spent months threatening to walk before finally ""terminating"" the agreement in July, alleging Twitter hadn't given him enough information about its business. 
Within days, the platform slapped him with a lawsuit to prevent him from backing out.
Although Musk did not disclose a reason for the stock sale in regulatory filings, he made his motivation clear on Twitter late Tuesday: ""In the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close *and* some equity partners don't come through, it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock,"" Musk said in a tweet.
In his pursuit of Twitter, which Musk has likened to a digital town square, he lined up $46.5 billion in financing, including one loan that uses his Tesla shares as collateral. 
A July 21 regulatory filing revealed the first two loans would come from investment bank Morgan Stanley and other lenders, worth $13 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively, while the third would be a $21 billion equity commitment from Musk himself.
A later filing detailed an eclectic mix of financiers that would help Musk come up with the cash, including a member of the Saudi royal family, the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar, and several hedge funds.

He last sold Tesla shares April 28, at which point he tweeted, ""No further TSLA sales planned after today."" According to SEC filings, he sold about $8.4 billion worth of stock.
Then he wanted out, accusing the company of having ""failed or refused to"" release information that would help Musk and his team ascertain the true number of bots or spam accounts on Twitter. He says he became increasingly concerned as he learned more about the platform's methods for verifying its users, to the point that he could no longer go through with the deal.
Twitter had initially resisted Musk's overtures - going so far as to adopt a ""poison pill"" strategy to make its shares less attractive to him - but it filed a lawsuit to enforce the transaction.
""Having mounted a public spectacle to put Twitter in play, and having proposed and then signed a seller-friendly merger agreement, Musk apparently believes that he - unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law - is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away,"" the company wrote in a fiery legal complaint, referring to Musk's exit strategy as a ""model of hypocrisy.""
A trial date has been set for October. In the meantime, both sides appear to be girding for a protracted legal brawl. Several of Musk's associates have been subpoenaed about the deal, The Washington Post reported last week. There also has been a flurry of contentious court filings.
Investors in both Tesla and Twitter seemed to react positively to the news, with shares surging 3.9 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively, amid a broader stock market rally. 
At $44.43 per share Wednesday, Twitter's stock price is close to where it was when Musk offered to buy it for $54.20 a share on April 14.
The stock climbed earlier in the year as Musk bought shares in advance of his takeover attempt, then fell throughout the summer as tech stocks faltered and Musk's relationship with Twitter publicly soured. 
The price has recovered more recently amid a broader resurgence for tech stocks.
Some investors view Musk's Tesla stock sales as a tacit admission that he is likely to lose in court. The wealth management firm Wedbush recently raised its price target for Twitter from $30 to $50.
The chances of a deal are viewed as significantly higher, either by order of the Delaware court or with the two parties coming up with a new agreement to avoid a court showdown, Wedbush senior analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors.
Wall Street is ""seeing through this poker move by Musk,"" Ives wrote.
Even if Musk prevails in court, he could still be on the hook for the $1 billion breakup fee that was written into the agreement.
Carl Tobias, Williams professor of law at Richmond University School of Law, says he thinks the two parties will settle the matter before it is decided by a court.
""I think [Musk] has a weak case and the judge is holding his feet to the fire,"" Tobias said.
He added that neither side of the dispute really wants Musk to be in charge of the social media giant at this point, and they are probably trying to find terms of departure that ""allow everybody to save face.""

TJX Cos. TJX-NYSE Outperform • Price $63.03 on Aug. 11 by Telsey Advisory Group TJX will report second-quarter results on Aug. 17 before the market open. We look for second-quarter earnings per share of $0.69, versus $0.79 last year, the consensus estimate of $0.67, and guidance of $0.65 to $0.69. Given the uncertain macro environment and record inflation, we believe that TJX is well positioned to capture more traffic than other retailers (primarily department stores), given its value positioning and the potential for consumers to trade down to its banners. Additionally, we have seen a fairly pronounced shift across retail with customers returning to shopping in physical stores after two years of pandemic-driven online shopping. In our view, TJX should benefit from this trend as consumers return to its bricks-and-mortar locations. Price target: $86.

Arch has a substantial capital-return program; it plans to return to shareholders approximately 50% of its prior quarter's discretionary cash flow, which is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditure less thermal mine reclamation fund contributions, in the form of a variable dividend. The remaining 50% will be used for further special dividends or buybacks. This is essentially a 100% cash-flow payout policy. Price target: $225.
Planet Fitness PLNT-NYSE Buy • Price $76.45 on Aug. 9 by Stifel Planet Fitness reported solid second-quarter results, including better-than-expected comps and earnings in line with the Street mean. Total membership was roughly in line with pre-Covid seasonality (16.5 million), and the company disclosed solid enrollments in its Summer Pass program, more than tripling the number of enrolled teens compared with the 2019 program. The company essentially reiterated its full-year guidance, with steady comp performance and improving corporate store-level margin offsetting lower equipment margin and incremental national marketing fund expenses. The mature store base also continues to progress toward recovering to prepandemic levels, with 34% of mature locations now at or above prepandemic levels compared with 30% pre-Covid. Price Target: $85.
Roblox RBLX-NYSE Sell • Price $47.35 on Aug. 10 by Benchmark Roblox [a videogame company] delivered disappointing fiscal second-quarter financial results—an in-line revenue result versus consensus and a meaningful miss on profit. Key performance indicators in the quarter should have benefited from a seasonal engagement lift, but instead delivered some of the worst metrics on record. July bookings result was less than buy-side consensus and could again pressure the third-quarter consensus view lower. Roblox expense growth is driving significant negative operating leverage, and free cash flow has gone negative, the worst result on record. We think that Roblox has been misbranded as a metaverse opportunity and continues to trade at what appears to be very aggressive valuation multiples; and growth has been dramatically failing. Price target: $21.
Twitter TWTR-NYSE Neutral • Price $42.94 on Aug. 10 by Wedbush Elon Musk sold another $7 billion of Tesla stock [TSLA] and then tweeted that this sale was done ""in the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close."" With the chances of a Twitter deal now more likely, in our opinion, and the Street seeing through this poker move by Musk, we are raising our price target from $30 (fair value, fundamentally) to $50.

339,17-Aug-22,Barron's (Online),Walmart's Woes Aren't Over as Fed Gives Clues on Next Move,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2702925381/BFD812D457A14912PQ/298?accountid=13946,"The latest Walmart earnings were seized on with relief. Americans are buying fewer items and paying more for them, but at least they are still spending.
The less positive readout is that even the largest U.S. retailer is struggling to keep track of changeable trading conditions during this year's cost-of-living crisis.
In February it was forecasting underlying adjusted earnings per share growth of 5-6% for this fiscal year but in May reined that into flat or a 1% decline and by July it was a 10-12% slide. Now Walmart is only penciling in an 8-10% drop. Some of its backlog of unsold goods has cleared, but it also canceled billions of dollars of orders.
The news was enough to send the shares up 5.1%, even though mixed messages for the U.S. economy persist. Headline inflation has eased to 8.5% but retail sales figures due today are expected to have inched up just 0.1% in July.
Conflicting signals extend to the Federal Reserve, with some concerned today's FOMC minutes might not be as dovish as investors who have pushed the S&P 500 7% higher since the last rate rise are hoping.
Several Fed officials have spoken out to insist the battle to tame inflation isn't over and a 75-basis points increase is possible next month. The dollar has recovered some ground in expectation of further aggressive hikes.
However, futures traders are banking on the Fed rate peaking at around 3.75% later this year before starting to decline next summer. Nouriel Roubini , the economist known as ""Dr. Doom"" to some for his often downbeat predictions, reckons that is optimistic and the Fed needs to hit 4.5-5% or else ""inflation expectations are going to get unhinged.""
Price pressures are still a big problem around the world. U.K. inflation rose in double digits in July, the fastest rate for 40 years.

Walmart, Home Depot Set Optimistic Tone for Retailers
Walmart's year is looking up, and so might the American consumer. The biggest U.S. retailer beat expectations for the second quarter and said earnings for the year wouldn't be as bad as feared just one month ago, when it warned about the effects of inflation on consumer behavior.
* Customers are still prioritizing the purchase of essentials over higher-profit items, but inventory levels peaked last quarter. Walmart now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to decline between 9% and 11% in fiscal 2023, better than its earlier forecast for a 11% to 13% drop.
* Quarterly revenue rose 8.4% as shoppers paid more for items and visited more often, and as the company notched market-share gains in its grocery business. Executives expect inflation and consumer spending to remain steady.
* CEO Doug McMillon said the discount retailer started drawing higher-income shoppers for groceries during the quarter, driving three-quarters of the market share gains. He also cited a strong start to the back-to-school shopping season.
* Home Depot posted its highest quarterly earnings and sales in company history, topping estimates, and said U.S. same-store sales jumped 5.4% despite a slowdown in new-home construction. Although the average transaction rose 9.1% to $90.02, total customer transactions fell 3%.
What's Next: Walmart plans to offer its Walmart+ members free access to Paramount Global's ad-supported streaming service, including shows such as Halo and Paw Patrol starting in September, The Wall Street Journal reported . Target and Lowe's report earnings today.

Biden Signs Inflation Reduction Act. Will EV Sales Jump?
President Joe Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, a sweeping set of spending initiatives on climate and health that aims to boost the renewable energy sector. But the effects on electric vehicle ownership won't be immediately obvious. It doesn't necessarily boost Tesla sales, for example.
* A $7,500 EV purchase tax credit only applies if the price of an electric sedan is under $55,000, or $80,000 for an SUV or truck. Tesla Model X and S vehicles, which can cost more than $100,000, won't qualify, nor will the Mercedes EQS, Porsche Taycan, and GMC Hummer.
* A typical Model 3 goes for $63,000, so it would also not qualify, but a base-level Model 3 starts at about $47,000. And the Tesla Model Y, which is an SUV, starts at about $70,000, so both would qualify.
* Price isn't the only factor, though. Final assembly has to be done in North America, which would disqualify EVs by Hyundai Motor, Kia, Audi, and Polestar Automotive. Those firms assemble EVs in Asia and Europe to be sold in the U.S.
* Buyers don't qualify if their household income is above $300,000 for a married couple and $150,000 for a single person. And there are also qualifications based on where the battery packs are assembled and where battery materials come from.
What's Next: Biden plans a celebration of the bill's signing on Sept. 6, and a coming cabinet meeting to talk about how to implement the various climate and healthcare aspects of the law. He is also planning a cross-country trip to promote the law as Democrats head into the midterm elections.

Buying Manchester United Was a Joke, Says Musk
Elon Musk tweeted Tuesday evening that he was buying the iconic British football club Manchester United . He later said he was joking. But like it or not, the tweet is another thing for Tesla investors to worry about.
* For starters, ""Tesla is Elon Musk"" as Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin put it to Barron's back in April when discussing any potential impact on Tesla stock arising from Musk's potential purchase of Twitter. Anything that affects Musk affects Tesla and Tesla stock.
* There also is the issue that Manchester United is a publicly traded company. If its stock moves it will matter to regulators even though he wrote on Twitter he won't be buying it: ""No, this is a long-running joke on Twitter. I'm not buying any sports teams.""
* However, a purchase of Manchester United wouldn't be all bad news. The team is an incredibly popular franchise—on the level of the New York Yankees. All those Manchester United fans could be potential Tesla customers.
What's Next: The market's collective eyes will be trained on Manchester United stock Wednesday, as well as Musk's Twitter account looking for further clarification.

Hearing Aids Cleared for Over-the-Counter Sales By Fall
People with mild to moderate hearing loss could start buying hearing aids over the counter at pharmacies and retail stores as early as mid-October, under a Food and Drug Administration final rule that enables purchases without a medical exam, a prescription or a fitting adjustment by an audiologist.
* The FDA said nearly 30 million adults could benefit from hearing aids to amplify speech and sounds, but that only about 20% use them. The devices can cost thousands of dollars and aren't covered by basic Medicare.
* The expansion could save thousands of dollars per pair and boost innovation and competition for the technology. Hearing aids for severe hearing impairment or for people under 18 will still require a prescription, the FDA said.
* Some of the biggest makers and distributors of hearing aids include privately held Minnesota-based Starkey, Italy's Amplifon, and Denmark's GN Store Nord. The Hearing Industries Association, a trade group, said it supports the rule, but recommends that people still see a hearing professional.
* ""This is a great example of a policy that will make a measurable positive difference in the lives of Americans all over the country,"" the White House's Office of Science Technology Policy said Tuesday.
What's Next: In response to public feedback and recommendations, the FDA will require over-the-counter hearing aids to have lower maximum sound output to reduce the risk from over-amplification, user-adjustable volume controls, and performance specifications.

American Airlines Pays Deposit for 20 Supersonic Jets
American Airlines is buying 20 planes from aerospace start-up Boom Supersonic, paying a nonrefundable deposit on supersonic equipment that is still in development and won't get off the ground for years. It joins United Airlines in the quest to bring back ultrafast travel.
* American also has an option to buy 40 more of the aircraft, Boom Supersonic said in a statement. Fort Worth-based Boom is designing the Overture to carry 65 to 80 passengers at twice the speed of commercial aircraft.
* Boom said its Overture jets will have the capacity to fly 600 routes in half the time as a regular plane, such as Miami to London in under five hours, or Los Angeles to Honolulu in three hours.
* But some are skeptical about its plans, and how much demand there is for ultra fast travel. The last supersonic jet, the Concorde, was limited by its high cost and loud noise to pricey routes between Europe and the East Coast before it was retired in 2003.
* Other companies have tried to revive the ultrafast flight technology since the Concorde went away. But Boeing-backed Aerion Supersonic closed last year after running out of money, The Wall Street Journal reported.
What's Next: Boom said it has 130 orders for its Overture, including 15 jets United Airlines agreed to buy last year and 20 that Japan Airlines ordered in 2017. Boom said its four-engine Overture jets will roll out in 2025 and carry passengers by 2029.

Dear Quentin,
I've been married for five years to my second husband. We are living in the house that I bought over 20 years ago that is in my name only, as is the mortgage.
He pays me a little less than half the amount of my mortgage, and we split other bills, with me paying a little more on utilities. I also pay for all upkeep and improvements to the house, although he does some of the labor.
I have an adult child and grandchild, and he has adult children as well. I would like to leave my house to my child, but would allow my husband to continue to live there as long as he'd like, or until his death. The mortgage would be paid off out of my estate.
Who should cover taxes and homeowner insurance each year? I'm leaning toward specifying that my husband cover that, and leaving funds for upkeep such as a new roof or air conditioning.
My husband and I disagree on whether he should inherit part of the house. He feels he's paying part of the mortgage. I don't want a portion of the house to go to his children when he dies, or for my child to have to buy them out.
What is the best way to do this equitably?

 Walmart's Woes Aren't Over as Fed Gives Clues on Next Move 
"
340,17-Aug-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk Tweets He's Buying Manchester United, Then Calls It a Joke; Billionaire's posts add to the list of eyebrow-raising statements he has made on the platform",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2702704466/BFD812D457A14912PQ/323?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk said on Twitter he was buying English soccer team Manchester United only to say hours later it was a joke, the latest example of the Tesla Inc. chief executive's using the platform to drop confusing statements about his intentions.
Mr. Musk's initial tweet on Tuesday came as a reply to a post he'd made five minutes earlier about politics, in which he said: ""To be clear, I support the left half of the Republican Party and the right half of the Democratic Party!"" Mr. Musk then tweeted: ""Also, I'm buying Manchester United ur welcome.""
In a follow-up tweet about 4½ hours later , responding to a follower asking if he was serious, Mr. Musk said: ""No, this is a long-running joke on Twitter. I'm not buying any sports teams.""
Mr. Musk didn't immediately respond to a request for comment late Tuesday.
Shares in Manchester United Ltd., the soccer team's New York Stock Exchange-listed parent, weren't trading at the time of Mr. Musk's initial tweet Tuesday. In premarket trading Wednesday, they surged as high as $14.89 a share, a gain of more than 16% from Tuesday's close. At that point Mr. Musk had already said his tweet about buying the club was a joke. The stock was up more than 2% in regular trading Wednesday.
The world's wealthiest person and one of Twitter's most prominent users, with more than 100 million followers, Mr. Musk has used the platform before to drop big pronouncements—some serious, many of them not.
Weeks after persuading Twitter Inc. to accept his $44 billion acquisition offer in April, he used the platform to say that the deal was ""temporarily on hold"" pending clarity on questions about the company's user data. He later cited the same issue, in part, as reason for trying to walk away from the deal, prompting Twitter to sue the billionaire to enforce the contract. A trial in that case is scheduled for October in Delaware's Court of Chancery. 
 PHOTOS: How Elon Musk Made the Fortune He'll Need to Buy Twitter 
Mr. Musk also tweeted several days after inking the Twitter acquisition deal that he was acquiring Coca-Cola Co., which at the time had a market value of about $282 billion. ""Next I'm buying Coca-Cola to put the cocaine back in,"" Mr. Musk wrote. On Tuesday, following his posts about Manchester United, he said, ""And I'm not buying Coca-Cola to put the cocaine back in, despite the extreme popularity of such a move.""
In December, Mr. Musk tweeted that he was ""thinking of quitting my jobs & becoming an influencer full-time wdyt,"" using an abbreviation for ""what do you think?"" Mr. Musk remains CEO of Tesla as well as rocket company SpaceX, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp.
In 2018 Mr. Musk suggested on Twitter he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. The Securities and Exchange Commission fined Mr. Musk for what it deemed a false statement. Mr. Musk also relinquished his role as Tesla chairman as part of the settlement. Mr. Musk is suing to have the settlement thrown out. 
Mr. Musk's Manchester United tweets come at a time of trouble around the team. It is widely considered one of the world's most valuable sports brands, with a base of passionate supporters that reaches around the globe, but the club has frequently been in turmoil. The U.S.-based Glazer family, then led by the late corporate raider Malcolm Glazer, took over the club in a leveraged buyout in 2005. The club went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2012, but the Glazers are the only entity holding more than 10% of its shares, according to the Manchester United website. The Glazers also own the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League.
From the start, the Glazers have had a contentious relationship with the team's fan base, which was upset about ceding control of the team to American buyers who had taken on significant debt to make the acquisition. The club has won five Premier League titles during their ownership, but ""Love United, Hate Glazers"" stickers—the remnants of a fan campaign against the owners—are nonetheless affixed to some seats at Old Trafford, the club's stadium.
The trouble has intensified as United lost its first two matches this season, placing it in last place in the standings and stoking fears that it has fallen out of England's soccer elites. Michael Knighton, a former director of the club, has recently said he is trying to put together a group that could wrest control of United from the Glazers.
A Buccaneers spokesman said the team operates completely separately from Manchester United. The English team didn't immediately respond to an email request for comment.
If Mr. Musk had made a real effort to buy Manchester United Ltd.—which has a market value of around $2 billion—it would have come with a price tag considerably smaller than Twitter. But buying the storied Premier League football team would have further stretched Mr. Musk's finances amid uncertainty over whether the Delaware court will force him to go through with the Twitter takeover. Earlier this month he sold nearly $7 billion in Tesla stock , saying he acted in case he had to buy Twitter. He also said he planned no further Tesla share sales.
When Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich earlier this year sold Chelsea FC after he was sanctioned in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the team went for £4.25 billion , equivalent to around $5.3 billion. It was acquired by a group led by Los Angeles Dodgers part-owner Todd Boehly.

 Elon Musk Tweets He's Buying Manchester United, Then Calls It a Joke

341,20-Aug-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Man United Becomes a Punchline --- The most successful club of the Premier League era appears to have run out of ideas,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2704162164/BFD812D457A14912PQ/629?accountid=13946,"It was the middle of the night in Manchester when the world's richest man appeared to turn himself into the unlikely savior of English soccer's most popular team. On Tuesday, Tesla co-founder Elon Musk fired off a 45-character tweet announcing that he planned to buy Manchester United.
For those beleaguered United supporters who happened to be awake, it seemed like a fever dream. Here was someone proposing to end the tenure of the U.S.-based Glazer family, a 17-year spell that included wild success in the beginning and nearly a decade of equally stunning failure. Four hours and 33 minutes later, Musk tweeted that it was all a gag.
As it turned out, the world's richest man was just another guy on Twitter cracking jokes at Manchester United's expense.
""I'm not buying any sports teams,"" Musk added.
United's transformation from the most dominant team of the Premier League era into a punchline seems to have accelerated lately. After nearly a decade of false starts, the club hit rock bottom last week with a 4-0 loss at the hands of Brentford. Worse than the comprehensive defeat, however, was that the result felt wholly unsurprising. For the first time since the league's founding in 1992, Manchester United slumped to last place in the standings. Two games in, the club has no points, one goal, and now has to face Liverpool on Monday.
""It's my responsibility,"" said new manager Erik ten Hag, the eighth man to stand on the touchline for United since Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013, including caretakers. ""Of course, I hoped for a better start. This start doesn't make it any easier.""
Nor does his current roster. Despite more than $1.5 billion in spending on new talent since Ferguson left, the squad remains a hodgepodge of parts assembled under a succession of different leaders.
United's crosstown rival, Manchester City, has shelled out more in that time (but its net spend is lower due to sale of players) and the club has five Premier League titles to show for itself. United, meanwhile, says that it still plans to make more signings before the transfer window closes on Sept. 1. Most recently, it's been linked with a move for U.S. men's national team captain Christian Pulisic, who has struggled to establish himself as a starter at Chelsea.
More notable than any arrival this summer is one potential exit. When United reacquired Cristiano Ronaldo last year, he became their oldest new outfield signing this century. He was also a living, breathing, preening paradox. Though Ronaldo was United's top scorer last season, fans viewed him as a symbol of everything that was wrong with the club -- a creaking institution trying to recapture former glory without a new idea in sight.
This wasn't lost on Ronaldo. Even he grew disgusted with how the club was being run during another dispiriting limp to sixth place. This summer, the 37-year-old Ronaldo let it be known that he wanted to move to a team that had qualified for the Champions League. So far, there are no serious signs of a club swooping in for him.
The combination of horrible results, aimless expenditure, and lack of a discernible plan has led United fans to focus their frustration on the Glazers. Supporters argue that more than half a billion dollars spent on servicing debt over the past decade has done little for the club's long-term stability, that managerial appointments have been below the club's lofty standards, and that necessary upgrades to their home stadium have been ignored. Fans haven't forgiven ownership for signing up United to the failed European Super League project in 2021 either.
Calls for change, which have echoed since Day 1 of the Glazer era, remain a daily occurrence.
""Any prospective new owner or investor has to be committed to the culture, ethos, and best traditions of the club,"" the Manchester United Supporters' Trust said on Thursday.
Still, fans of Premier League clubs have shown over and over again that they don't care much where their teams' owners come from or how they make their money. Talk of vetting investors and making sure there are no off-field skeletons tend to stop at the faintest glimmer of on-field success.
Chelsea fans chanted the name of Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich last season even as he was forced to sell the club under the threat of impending sanctions. Manchester City's Etihad Stadium features a banner thanking Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi who bought the club in 2008, despite concerns over Abu Dhabi's human-rights record. And in Newcastle last year, fans danced outside St. James' Park when news broke that their club had been acquired by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. Promises of lavish spending and the prospect of a first major English trophy since the 1950s were enough to quell their unease about how Saudi does business outside soccer.
So by the standards of Russian oligarchs and Middle Eastern petrostates, a possible United takeover by an eccentric billionaire with dreams of going to Mars might have seemed pretty palatable -- except, of course, it was all a gag.
Musk was joking, but at least one other prospective buyer clearly isn't. The British petrochemicals billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, fresh from his failed, late bid for Chelsea this spring, has said he would bid if he felt the club was receptive. (One person with knowledge of his thinking has said that an offer was already in the works.)
""We would be interested in buying the club if it is up for sale,"" an Ineos spokesman said.
The club, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, hasn't commented on sale rumors. Should it be available, United could fetch a price far higher than its current market capitalization of around $2.3 billion, thanks to an industry-leading commercial operation that made Man United a global household name.
Still, all of that commercial success hinged on success on the field first. And in the short term, that is something that even one of the biggest sales in sports can't fix. Two games into his career as Man United manager, ten Hag is merely the latest coach to discover just how broken the club is. He even has Elon Musk making the point.
""Other teams are improving a lot and it looks like we're in the same place,"" ten Hag said last week. ""It's rubbish. It's poor and we need higher standards than that -- it's clear.""

342,22-Aug-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk's Lawyers Seek Documents From Former Twitter Chief Jack Dorsey; Subpoena is first sign the social-media firm's co-founder will be an official part of the legal fight over Tesla CEO's $44 billion takeover deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2705258603/BFD812D457A14912PQ/206?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk's lawyers have sent a subpoena to Jack Dorsey, the first indication that Twitter Inc.'s co-founder and former chief executive will be officially involved in the legal fight over Mr. Musk's stalled $44 billion deal.
Mr. Musk is seeking documents from Mr. Dorsey relating to the effect of false or spam accounts on the social-media platform's business. The Tesla Inc. CEO is also seeking information about Twitter's use of monetizable daily active users, or MDAUs, as an important metric and any other metrics the company might use to describe user or advertiser engagement.
The subpoena sent to Mr. Dorsey, dated Aug. 19 and made public Monday, is one of dozens that have been issued by both parties in the case in recent weeks, including to members of Mr. Musk's inner circle of Silicon Valley investors, friends and financial backers . It is particularly noteworthy given Mr. Dorsey's former role at Twitter and the yearslong relationship between the two men.
""Elon is the singular solution I trust,"" Mr. Dorsey tweeted on April 25, the day Twitter accepted Mr. Musk's bid. ""I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.""
A lawyer representing Mr. Dorsey didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Musk's attorneys declined to comment. A spokesman for Twitter declined to comment.
 Mr. Dorsey, who resigned from Twitter late last year under pressure from its board, was among those whispering in Mr. Musk's ear that Twitter should be a private company, The Wall Street Journal reported in April.
The billionaires have been seemingly friendly for years, exchanging messages on Twitter on shared topics of interest such as cryptocurrency. In early 2020, while Mr. Dorsey was on stage at a Twitter all-hands event in Houston, he called Mr. Musk on FaceTime. Both men have stood out for running two tech companies at the same time. Mr. Dorsey was once simultaneously CEO of Twitter and payments company Block Inc., formerly known as Square. Mr. Musk is currently CEO of Tesla and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX.
After stepping down from the top job at Twitter in late 2021, Mr. Dorsey was openly critical of the company and its board of directors, many of whom he put in their roles. On Twitter he took a vague swipe at the board and seemingly endorsed criticism of a core feature of the platform that was instituted more than a decade earlier when he was chairman.
When Mr. Musk mocked Twitter's top legal boss on April 28 on its own platform, prompting online attacks toward her from his followers, Mr. Dorsey didn't take a public stand. At the time, current and former Twitter employees said Mr. Dorsey's lack of public comment shocked them because in 2018 he committed to reducing abuse and harassment on the platform.

""We have witnessed abuse, harassment, troll armies, manipulation through bots and human-coordination, misinformation campaigns, and increasingly divisive echo chambers,"" he tweeted that year.
Mr. Dorsey hasn't publicly weighed in on the legal dispute between Mr. Musk and Twitter in a substantive way and hasn't made a public statement about Mr. Musk's prospective ownership or decision to abandon the deal since he tweeted his support in April.
According to Twitter's 2022 proxy statement, Mr. Dorsey owns about 18 million shares in Twitter. At the agreed takeover price of $54.20, that would value his stake at roughly $1 billion.
The outcome of the nonjury trial in October will be decided by Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick , and her ruling could set a new standard for when buyers can or can't walk away from deals.
 How Elon Musk Made His Fortune 
The Tesla CEO was a millionaire in his 20s and has parlayed each business success into new endeavors
In addition to Mr. Dorsey, Mr. Musk's lawyers have also sent a subpoena to former Twitter employee Kayvon Beykpour, who was general manager of the company's consumer business until May. Mr. Beykpour tweeted that he was asked to leave the company while he was on paternity leave . One of Mr. Musk's counterclaims is that Twitter made firing decisions without his consent in violation of the merger agreement. Twitter has argued that making personnel changes is within its rights under the deal's terms.
Mr. Musk has said in regulatory and court filings that he wanted out of the deal primarily because Twitter hadn't provided the necessary data and information he needs to assess the prevalence of fake or spam accounts.
According to court filings, Mr. Musk's lawyers appear to be looking for evidence to support counterclaims that Twitter is guilty of being dishonest about how it measures spam and fake accounts on its platform, including the number of monetizable daily active users that the company claims it has. Twitter has said for years that it estimates fewer than 5% of its monetizable daily active users are spam and fake accounts, a figure Mr. Musk has disputed.
Twitter rejects that assertion and argues that Mr. Musk hasn't adhered to the deal terms, including violating a nondisclosure agreement and then bragging about it on Twitter.
Twitter also has alleged that Mr. Musk soured on the deal when markets turned and he lost significant personal wealth. Twitter has sent subpoenas to banks and investors seeking, among other things, documents and communications about Mr. Musk's efforts to finance the takeover.

Mr. Musk's timing for delivering this message in Europe could hardly be better. Let's hope he can help prevent some European misery this winter as the region faces natural gas shortages. On Friday Mr. Musk tweeted :
Countries should be increasing nuclear power generation! It is insane from a national security standpoint & bad for the environment to shut them down.
American policy makers could also benefit from Mr. Musk's advice.

What U.S. Investors Need Some people may think that an utter failure to evaluate and prioritize risks is merely a public health story. But Beltway financial regulators are lately showing a similar ability to boggle the mind. One the one hand, Chairman Gary Gensler of the Securities and Exchange Commission has unleashed a blizzard of new rule proposals upon the already hyper-regulated U.S. financial system. The Journal's Paul Kiernan reports: 
Brokerages, hedge funds, private-equity firms, mutual funds, high-frequency trading firms and public companies have argued in comment letters filed this year that the costs of many of the proposals would outstrip the benefits, and that the SEC's studies of the issues are flawed.
Mr. Gensler is pursuing what lawyers and former regulators say is the SEC's most aggressive agenda in decades, an effort that could upend established and lucrative business models. It includes requiring public companies to disclose information related to climate change, bringing more transparency to private-equity and hedge funds, imposing stricter rules for investment products advertised as environmentally or socially responsible, and overhauling the way stock trades are executed.
On the other hand, where there is an obvious need for more disclosure, Mr. Gensler seems to be opting for a relatively light touch. The Journal's Keith Zhai, Paul Kiernan and Michelle Chan report :
Washington and Beijing reached an agreement for U.S. accounting regulators to inspect China-based audits, laying the groundwork for a monthslong process that could prevent numerous Chinese companies from being booted off American stock exchanges.
It's nice for the Chinese firms if they can avoid being ejected from our equity markets. But does this mean U.S. investors will get the solid and relevant information they deserve? The Journal reporters note:
While both sides used optimistic language to describe the agreement, the two nations appeared to differ on what the agreement said about the detailed process for U.S. regulators to inspect Chinese audits. Officials from the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said they agreed with their Chinese counterparts to not make the language of the deal public.
Of course the SEC should always be careful when handling nonpublic information about particular firms. But to keep secret a policy agreement made with an oppressive foreign dictatorship is outrageous. If there is one government in the world from which the SEC should be demanding more transparency it is the Chinese Communist Party. U.S. investors, who will be the ones suffering if securities frauds go undetected, deserve to know much more.

344,29-Aug-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Tesla Sues to Sell Cars Directly to Consumers in Louisiana; Legal battle represents new front in push by Elon Musk's car company to bypass dealerships,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2707676726/BFD812D457A14912PQ/179?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc. has filed suit to challenge a Louisiana law it says restricts its ability to sell electric vehicles directly to customers and violates its constitutional rights.
The lawsuit filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana is the latest action by Tesla to try to open markets to its model of selling cars directly to consumers rather than using dealers as intermediaries. Tesla argues the state law, among other things, infringes on interstate commerce.
Elon Musk Beyond Tesla
The electric-vehicle maker is suing the Louisiana Automobile Dealers Association, multiple officials on the Louisiana Motor Vehicle Commission and some dealerships in the state, which Tesla says conspired to bring the current laws and regulations into place.
""Louisiana consumers' freedom is being unduly restricted by protectionist, anticompetitive, and inefficient state regulation and laws,"" Tesla said in the lawsuit. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Louisiana Automobile Dealers Association and the Louisiana Motor Vehicle Commission didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.
The state ban against selling vehicles directly to consumers went into effect in 2017. Such types of laws were first brought about in the 1950s to stop stores from being arbitrarily shut down by manufacturers. In recent years, they have been used by dealer lobbyists and some car makers who say all stores should be independently owned.
The franchise laws and other efforts that protect dealers from competition from car makers have been an issue for Tesla for years. The car maker filed a similar lawsuit in Michigan in 2016 after the state denied the company a license to open a store to sell directly to consumers. The state and Tesla settled their dispute, enabling direct sales by the car maker to in-state customers.
As Tesla has grappled with local restrictions, it has found ways to put its vehicles into customers' hands. In Texas, for example, it has so-called galleries where potential customers can learn about its cars but those buyers must go online to actually purchase a vehicle. In Louisiana, Tesla said, customers were going out of state to buy its vehicles after the state's move in 2017 to bolster franchise laws that effectively banned direct sales.
Tesla is also claiming that the defendants in the Louisiana case, by citing the state law, have tried to prevent it from leasing cars and operating warranty repair shops that are meant to service the 3,000 Tesla vehicles currently registered in the state. Tesla disagrees with that interpretation of the law and has been involved in a separate legal battle with some of the defendants over the issue.
Auto makers with long-established dealership networks are also rethinking their sales model when it comes to electric vehicles.
General Motors Co. says dealers will only be shipped the number of Hummer electric pickup trucks that have been ordered by customers through its website. A few months back, Ford Motor Co. outlined plans for customers to order EVs online at a no-haggle price. The dealership would still be involved to deliver cars.
Separately, the National Labor Relations Board on Monday ruled against Tesla in a case about whether workers could be required to wear shirts with the company's logo to work, which effectively prevented them from being able to wear union-branded clothing. The board sided with employees, saying the Tesla company-branded clothing standard violated NLRB policy.
The NLRB and Tesla have clashed before over unionization efforts at the car maker.

345,30-Aug-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Sends Letter to Twitter With Added Reasons Why He Can Cancel Buyout,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2707831157/BFD812D457A14912PQ/325?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk sends a letter to Twitter that includes additional reasons to terminate his acquisition of the social media company.

Elon Musk sent a letter to Twitter that included additional reasons for why the Tesla chief executive believed he can terminate the purchase of the social media company.
Twitter (ticker: TWTR) shares fell 0.8% to $39.74 on Tuesday. Tesla (TSLA) declined slightly.
Musk sent a letter dated Aug. 29 to Twitter, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It follows reports last week that Twitter's former security chief, Peiter Zatko, filed a whistleblower complaint with the SEC alleging the company deceived its board and federal authorities about vulnerabilities to hackers and its efforts to fight spam. Those claims provided Musk with fresh ammunition in the billionaire's legal battle to get out of his $44 billion deal to acquire Twitter.
In the letter, Musk alleged that Zatko's whistleblower complaint ""demonstrate that Twitter has breached the following provisions of the Merger Agreement, thereby giving the Musk Parties the right to terminate the Merger Agreement.""
Musk and his lawyers wrote in the letter that the ""Zatko Complaint alleges far-reaching misconduct at Twitter—all of which was disclosed to Twitter's directors and senior executives, including Parag Agrawal—that is likely to have severe consequences for Twitter's business.""
Lawyers for Musk and Twitter have subpoenaed Zatko. Musk's lawyers are seeking documents relating to the effect of false or spam accounts on Twitter's business operations, among other requests, according to a court filing.
Twitter responded to Musk's lawyers shortly after his letter was disclosed. ""As was the case with your July 8, 2022 purported notice of termination, the purported termination set forth in your August 29, 2022 letter is invalid and wrongful under the Agreement,"" read part of the response.
The legal applicability of whistleblower claims is hard to determine. It adds a wrinkle to the already-dramatic proceedings. ""Zatko whistleblower situation adds complexity,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note on Tuesday. He thinks it helps Musk calling it a ""huge potential win.""
Ives sees four potential outcomes from the Twitter/Musk legal drama: Musk pays the $1 billion break up fee and walks away; Musk is forced by the Delaware court to pay $54.20 a share to purchase Twitter; a settlement between Musk and Twitter at either a lower price or higher break fee; or Musk wins in Delaware and walks without paying.
Settlement along with the court forcing buying are Ives' two highest scenarios. The trial is currently slated to begin Oct. 17 in Delaware.
Investors expect a lower-priced deal. Future Fund Active ETF (FFND) cofounder Gary Black ran a Twitter poll this past week asking his 215,000-plus followers what they expected. His options were a little different than Ives, but settlement won by a landslide.
Black is a Tesla shareholder. He probably hopes Musk won't end up owning Twitter. The Twitter situation has been an overhang on Tesla stock for months with investors worried about distraction for the Tesla CEO. Black didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tesla stock has fallen about 21% since Musk's Twitter stake was announced in early April, but the market has declined too. The Nasdaq Composite Index is down about 16% over the same span.
The impact on Twitter stock is easier to see. Shares have risen about 2% since Musk's stake was announced, outperforming the Nasdaq by about 18 percentage points.
Ives, for his part, covers both stocks. He rates Twitter shares Hold and has a $50 price target for shares. He rates Tesla stock at Buy and has a $360 price target for that stock.

346,30-Aug-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk Against Twitter: What to Know About Their Coming Trial; Fight over $44 billion takeover of social-media company heads to Delaware Chancery Court on Oct. 17,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2707862174/BFD812D457A14912PQ/338?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk and Twitter Inc. are to face off in Delaware Chancery Court starting Oct. 17, as the social-media company seeks to force the billionaire to complete his $44 billion takeover. The two sides have spent recent weeks seeking information to buttress their respective positions, sometimes appealing to the judge to make the other party comply with their demands. Here is what to know:
Why are Mr. Musk and Twitter fighting in court?
Mr. Musk gave notice on July 8 that he wanted out of the deal , arguing that Twitter hadn't provided the necessary data and information to assess the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on the platform. Days later, the social-media company sued Mr. Musk to enforce the deal at the earlier agreed-upon terms.
The roots of the saga date to late January, when Mr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc., quietly began buying Twitter stock. He was its largest individual investor by the time his stake became public in early April . He later moved to acquire the entire company with an eye toward taking it private. Twitter agreed to sell itself that month.
In the following weeks, Mr. Musk repeatedly voiced concerns about Twitter's management and the presence of spam bots and fake accounts on the platform. In May, Mr. Musk said he was putting the deal ""temporarily on hold"" until he received more information about the matter, though he also said was still committed to the transaction. Less than two months later he sought to pull the plug.
What do the two sides allege?
Twitter argues in its lawsuit that it complied with data requests from Mr. Musk and that he was using the spam bots as an excuse to get out of the deal after market conditions worsened, pinching his personal wealth .
""Rather than bear the cost of the market downturn, as the merger agreement requires, Musk wants to shift it to Twitter's stockholders,"" the company said.
Mr. Musk accuses Twitter of fraud . He said that he became concerned about the deal after Twitter restated some user numbers in April and after meeting with company executives in May to discuss how the platform measures spam and fake accounts. In a legal filing, Mr. Musk's side said he became dismayed at the company's process around such accounts, including the lack of automated tools to help with the calculation. He also alleges that Twitter made changes to the business, including certain personnel matters, that he should have been consulted on as the future owner.
Twitter argues that Mr. Musk failed to comply with aspects of the deal, including breaking nondisclosure terms.
What are spam bots?
Spam and fake accounts are an industrywide challenge for social-media companies. In many cases they are managed by what are known as bots, or automated software programs capable of quickly and widely disseminating posts. Such accounts hurt the experience for legitimate users, who see posts that they don't realize are generated by bots or otherwise under false pretenses.
Operators of bots have used fake accounts to incite violence, spread false information, deceptively attempt to influence political activity or achieve other illicit goals. Fake accounts can also make it harder for advertisers on social-media platforms to measure what they are getting for their money.
Twitter estimates that such accounts represent less than 5% of its monetizable daily average users, but says that the actual number could be higher. Mr. Musk argues that the figure is far higher.
Mr. Musk, who has more than 100 million followers on Twitter, likely has far greater exposure and experience with fake and spam accounts than most on the social-media platform, researchers say.
Mr. Musk waived due diligence in the deal process and has argued Twitter failed to furnish him the data to verify the number. Twitter said it has provided Mr. Musk ample data, but also that its accounting is difficult for outsiders to replicate .
The billionaire tweeted before the merger agreement was signed that it was his intention to ""defeat the spam bots or die trying!""

What is the Delaware Chancery Court?
The court is widely considered the nation's top tribunal for corporate takeover and merger disputes .
Twitter, like many companies, is incorporated in Delaware. Roughly two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies are domiciled there, according to its secretary of state. Twitter and Mr. Musk agreed to use the Chancery Court, or any state or federal court in Delaware, to settle disputes arising from his potential purchase of the microblogging website.
The Chancery Court, a nonjury trial court, calls itself the pre-eminent U.S. forum for legal cases involving the internal affairs of Delaware corporations and other business entities that conduct ""a vast amount of the world's commercial affairs.""
Who is to decide the fate of the Musk-Twitter deal?
Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick is to decide the case . She joined the Chancery Court in 2018 when it expanded to seven members from five. Named chancellor last year, she became the first woman to lead the court in its 230-year history.
Lawyers say Chancellor McCormick, who began her career as a legal-aid attorney, has a reputation for strong preparation, an ability to dissect complex corporate contracts, and a willingness to work around the clock when needed. In 2019, she steered a lawsuit challenging a takeover from start to finish in under two months, writing the 95-page decision over a weekend spent working at her house and office.
Chancellor McCormick is separately presiding over another multibillion-dollar lawsuit involving Mr. Musk. In that case, a Tesla shareholder alleges the board violated its fiduciary duties by awarding Mr. Musk a $56 billion compensation package in 2018. Tesla denies that. A trial is currently scheduled soon after the Twitter case.
What are the potential outcomes?
Twitter asked Chancellor McCormick to compel Mr. Musk to go through with the deal, the corporate equivalent of a shotgun wedding.
Alternatively, she could cut him loose by finding, as Mr. Musk alleges, that Twitter violated the merger agreement by misleading him about the prevalence of spam or fake accounts on its service.
Mr. Musk sold nearly $7 billion in Tesla stock in early August, citing uncertainty over the Twitter deal: ""In the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close and some equity partners don't come through, it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock.""
Twitter and Mr. Musk could also settle their dispute out of court.

What is Twitter's legal strategy?
In early August, Twitter issued subpoenas to several of Mr. Musk's Silicon Valley investors, friends and financial backers in search of communications from those people related to the deal. The company's goal is likely to determine whether Mr. Musk had other concerns about completing his agreement to buy the company, beyond what he has said publicly, according to lawyers and academics not involved in the case.
Twitter also sent subpoenas to at least a dozen banks for information on equity and debt financing and communications around the deal.
The subpoenas requested information and documents, including face-to-face conversations, physical mail, emails, text messages, instant messages, social-media contacts, facsimiles and phone conversations, according to court documents. Legal filings from Twitter show that the company is asking, among other things, for any documents and communications relating to fake or spam accounts.
Twitter might be searching for communications that would support its argument that Mr. Musk is balking because he lost more than $100 billion of his wealth amid the market downturn, lawyers and academics say. Mr. Musk pledged as much as $33 billion of his own money toward the deal.
What are Mr. Musk's counterclaims?
In early August Mr. Musk filed a countersuit against Twitter, accusing the company of misrepresenting the condition of its business and crucial metrics about the users on its platform.
Mr. Musk alleges that many Twitter users who are counted as monetizable don't add to the company's financial success, as the company represents, because most monetizable daily average users are served almost no ads.
Twitter responded to Mr. Musk's countersuit, saying Mr. Musk's claim that he was misled is implausible and that the billionaire doesn't have the right to back out based on his concerns over the number of spam or fake accounts on its platform.
Twitter also said that Mr. Musk hasn't identified a false or misleading statement in its regulatory disclosures, and that he is attempting to distort data and use litigation to undermine Twitter's business.
What does the Twitter whistleblower claim have to do with this?
Some of Mr. Musk's allegations were supported by a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission in July by Twitter's former head of security , Peiter Zatko , who was fired earlier this year. Mr. Zatko, a former hacker known as ""Mudge,"" is a noted computer-security researcher. His submission, which was made public in late August, accuses Twitter of making misleading regulatory disclosures about spam and fake accounts.
In a late August hearing in Wilmington, Del., Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Mr. Musk, pointed to Mr. Zatko's whistleblower complaint to bolster his argument accusing Twitter of misleading shareholders with information Mr. Musk relied on when agreeing to the terms of the merger.
A legal filing made public on Aug. 29 shows that Mr. Musk's team sent a subpoena to Mr. Zatko, seeking documents and communications about how Twitter measures and deals with fake and spam accounts. It also requests information pertaining to reports about the company's alleged security vulnerabilities that were sent to Chief Executive Parag Agrawal or other executives and it calls for details on Mr. Zatko's departure from Twitter.
The subpoena proposes a deposition on Sept. 9. Debra Katz, an attorney representing Mr. Zatko, said that he would comply with the legal obligations of the subpoena and that his appearance at the deposition would be involuntary.
What impact could the whistleblower complaint have?
 The whistleblower complaint is separate from the merger dispute and there are differences between its arguments and those made by Mr. Musk. Still, it could be wielded to request more discovery, add fresh claims and provide new information about whether Mr. Musk had accurate details when he agreed to buy the company, according to legal scholars, litigators and lawyers following the case.
On Aug. 30, a securities filing showed that Mr. Musk's lawyers sent a new letter to Twitter updating their grounds for terminating the deal in response to Mr. Zatko's complaint. The letter states that the allegations in it, if true, would demonstrate a breach by Twitter of certain provisions of the merger agreement, constituting a ""material adverse effect.""
Twitter responded with a letter saying it hasn't breached any of its obligations under its merger agreement with Mr. Musk. In the letter, disclosed the same day in a securities filing, the company also repeated that it intends to enforce the deal at the agreed-upon terms and price and that the statements made in Mr. Zatko's complaint are ""riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lack important context.""
Separately, Twitter said in a statement that it hasn't suffered and isn't likely to suffer a ""material adverse effect.""
Meanwhile, Mr. Musk's lawyers also filed a proposed order in Delaware Chancery Court on Aug. 30 asking the judge for permission to amend the billionaire's countersuit and to push the trial to November from October.

347,30-Aug-22,Daily Herald,"LG, Honda teaming up for $4.4 billion U.S. battery venture",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2707888907/BFD812D457A14912PQ/669?accountid=13946,"LG, Honda teaming up for $4.4 billion U.S. battery venture TOKYO — Major South Korean battery maker LG and Japanese automaker Honda are investing $4.4 billion in a joint venture to produce batteries for Honda electric vehicles in the North American market, the two companies said Monday. They say the plant’s U.S. site is still undecided, but it’s likely to be near Marysville, Ohio, or Greensburg, Indiana, where Honda has huge factories. Construction is to begin in early 2023, with mass production of advanced lithium-ion battery cells to start by the end of 2025. The closing of the deal is subject to regulatory approval. They say the plant will produce batteries exclusively for Honda vehicles assembled in North America, including its Acura brand.
Elon Musk subpoenas Twitter whistleblower ahead of trial WILMINGTON, Del. — Elon Musk’s legal team is demanding to hear from Twitter’s whistleblowing former security chief, who could help bolster Musk’s case for backing out of a $44 billion deal to buy the social media company. Former Twitter executive Peiter Zatko — also known by his hacker handle ""Mudge"" — received a subpoena Saturday from Musk’s team, according to Zatko’s lawyer and court records. The billionaire Tesla CEO has spent months alleging that the company he agreed to acquire undercounted its fake and spam accounts — and that he shouldn’t have to consummate the deal as a result. Zatko’s whistleblower complaint to U.S. officials alleging Twitter misled regulators about its privacy and security protections — and its ability to detect and root out fake accounts — might play into Musk’s hands in an upcoming trial scheduled for Oct. 17 in Delaware.
52 million tickets sold for ultra-cheap travel in Germany BERLIN — About 52 million tickets allowing people to use local public transportation across Germany for just 9 euros per month were sold over the summer, a group representing transit companies said Monday, days before the project ends and amid widespread calls for some kind of successor. The ""9-euro ticket,"" which was introduced for three months at the beginning of June, was part of a government program intended to help combat high inflation and fuel prices. The government had also lowered the tax on fuel, a discount that ends on Wednesday, too. The ticket is valid on all local and regional transportation, though not on intercity trains, and has been a hit with day-trippers and others over the summer.
The VDV group, which represents more than 630 German transportation companies, said that around 52 million of the tickets have been sold during the three-month period. On top of that, more than 10 million people who already had transport passes had the difference between their usual price and the nine-euro ticket reimbursed. Germany has 83 million inhabitants. VDV said a survey that it coordinated with national railway operator Deutsche Bahn, based on 6,000 interviews per week, found that 10% of trips with the ultra-cheap ticket replaced journeys that otherwise would have been made by car."
348,31-Aug-22,Barron's (Online),Goldman Heralds Another Return-to-Office Push. It's Different This Time.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2708212754/BFD812D457A14912PQ/633?accountid=13946,"David Solomon's side gig as a DJ demonstrates the Goldman Sachs CEO believes staff should enjoy themselves after hours. But the Wall Street supremo is also clear about where they should be during work time: in the office.
Goldman's latest memo tells workers that all Covid-19 protocols have been lifted as it pushes to get them back behind their desks five days a week following Labor Day.
Solomon has long been keen on a return, but the Omicron variant upset efforts. He warned in May that getting staff back to the office could take years , as in-person attendance at the bank's U.S. sites stuck at less than 60%.
Goldman is not alone. Apple wants corporate workers to be on site for at least three days a week, but some staff are petitioning for a more flexible approach .
Employees that got used to home comforts during lockdown are still in a strong position, given that job openings are rising faster than economists expect, which suggests wages will carry on inflating.
However, there are notable workforce culls under way at Ford and, reportedly, Snap. Bosses calculate the tide is turning and expect the unemployment rate to lift from a lowly 3.5%.
Famous for its long-hours culture, Goldman is trying to be more worker-friendly, borrowing from the tech sector playbook by dropping the set number of vacation days for partners and managing directors.
The bank paid out an extra $4.4 billion in compensation for 2021 after revenue hit a record $59 billion, but more recently hiring has slowed as deal-making activity eased off.
However, the jobs market might not slacken much. As the Federal Reserve acts to cool the economy, Goldman itself reckons the U.S. recession would likely be mild , with a limited increase in the unemployment rate of around one percentage point.

Wealthier Consumers Still in 'Pretty Good Shape' and Still Spending
As the Federal Reserve aims to tame inflation without triggering a recession, companies catering to the wealthiest Americans are the most likely to thrive. ""The consumer, and especially the higher end consumer, is in pretty good shape,"" said Doug Kelly, partner and portfolio manager Williams Jones Wealth Management.
* The top 20% of U.S. households account for nearly 40% of all consumer spending, or 28% of gross domestic product. With an average income of more than $176,000 a year after taxes, their continued spending can limit the length and severity of an economic downturn.
* But their wealth doesn't mean they're entirely insulated from inflationary pressures. A recent survey by Willis Towers Watson found that 36% of Americans making six figures are living paycheck to paycheck. LendingClub says 30% of those earning $250,000 a year are, too.
* Pickleball, a combination of tennis, badminton, and ping pong, is the fastest-growing sport in the U.S. for the second straight year, with 4.8 million ""picklers"" nationwide. Pickleball courts are an increasingly popular amenity that is popping up in more luxury housing developments.
* Last-minute summer cruise bookings are up nearly 10% over prepandemic levels. There is also strong demand at Expedia's Hotels.com and Marriott International's international and luxury destinations, fueled by people looking to splurge on experiences over goods.
What's Next: Mel Dohmen, senior manager of brand marketing at Hotels.com, told Barron's that he is seeing strong demand beyond the summer months for domestic travel destinations such as Orlando, and for overseas in places such as Mexico's Riviera Maya, Paris, London, and Rome.

Elon Musk Cites Another Reason to Cancel Twitter Deal
Elon Musk is offering more reasons he should be able to cancel his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter, citing allegations in the whistleblower complaint filed by the social media platform's former security chief, Peiter Zatko, that he says are ""likely to have severe consequences for Twitter's business.""
* In an Aug. 29 letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Musk said Zatko's accusations that Twitter deceived its board and federal authorities about vulnerabilities to hackers and efforts to fight spam are breaches of the merger agreement, giving the Tesla CEO the right to terminate the deal.
* Twitter responded to Musk's lawyers that the Aug. 29 letter is just as invalid as his July 8 one, and is based solely on third-party statements that Twitter said are ""riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lack important context."" Lawyers for Musk and Twitter have subpoenaed Zatko seeking more information.
* Tulane Law School professor Ann M. Lipton told Barron's that Zatko's allegations about bots conflict with Musk's claims that Twitter has undercounted spam accounts among its moneymaking daily active users, sending the message that ""everything Musk has said up until now has been wrong and he'd like a do-over.""
* Wedbush analyst Dan Ives sees four potential outcomes: Musk pays the $1 billion breakup fee and walks away; Musk is forced to buy Twitter at $54.20 a share; Musk and Twitter settle at a lower price or higher breakup fee; or Musk wins in Delaware without paying.
What's Next: The trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 17 in Delaware Chancery Court. Boston College Law School professor Brian Quinn told Barron's he expects Twitter will amend its complaint to ask the court to rule on the basis for termination, which will likely delay the trial date.

Republican Politicians Ramp Up ESG Battle With Wall Street
As more people consider a company's social, environmental and governance position when investing, Republican politicians are pushing back at Wall Street, arguing ESG investing hurts fossil-fuel producers and forces American corporations to follow a liberal agenda at the expense of profit.
* ESG funds and climate investing are among the hottest trends in the industry, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing Morningstar. Hundreds of new funds roll out each quarter and the sector holds $2.5 trillion, much invested in U.S. companies.
* Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis barred the state's pension managers from considering ESG factors, and Texas' state comptroller effectively blocked BlackRock, BNP, and Credit Suisse from business there because they ""boycott"" energy companies. West Virginia already blocked BlackRock and others, saying ESG is bad for its economy.
* Wall Street firms, including those facing state bans, lend billions of dollars to fossil-fuel companies, the Journal reported. Oil-and-gas company debt financing and green-bond funding are about the same amount, according to Dealogic data. Some banks are reducing lending to coal producers.
* The Investment Company Institute told Barron's after Texas's move that it would cut options for pension managers. ""A state-mandated boycott of certain funds could restrict their ability to choose from the full range of available investments"" for retirees in Texas.
What's Next: Florida's move, telling state fund managers only to weigh ""pecuniary factors"" in their investment decisions, echoes a Trump-era Labor Department for advisors to plans covered under the Retirement Income Security Act. The Biden administration is trying to undo the rule.

Europe Faces a Prolonged Period of High Energy Prices
Europe faces a prolonged period of high energy prices and the possibility of shortages, according to officials and energy executives, as the continent works to replace Russian imports with supplies from the U.S., Canada and Qatar, The Wall Street Journal reported.
* A drop in consumption this year gives Europe room to secure enough natural gas supply so it doesn't have to ration this winter, the Journal reported. Oil prices have also come down, with Brent crude falling below $100 a barrel.
* Russia's Gazprom is set to shut the Nord Stream natural-gas pipeline today for maintenance and reopen it on Saturday. The question is whether Europe will get enough natural gas from Russia going forward. Gazprom is cutting gas deliveries to French utility Engie SA because of a contract dispute.
* Shares of energy giants such as Marathon Oil, Occidental Petroleum, and Exxon Mobil fell Tuesday as oil prices shed more than 5% on fears of a global growth slowdown.
* Exxon told Russian officials it will file a lawsuit unless the Moscow government allows it to exit the Sakhalin-1 oil-and-gas project in the far east portion of the country, the Journal reported. Exxon is selling its 30% stake after Russia invaded Ukraine.
What's Next: Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have advised investors to turn back to energy investing, with the caveat that both banks believe fears of a global recession are overblown, meaning commodity demand will likely remain strong.

Dear Quentin,
I recently took a trip to another country with a friend. We agreed to share expenses. When they presented their list of expenses, they included a foreign transaction fee charged by the credit card they used.
Before we left for the trip, I researched my credit cards and used the one that did not charge a foreign transaction fee. We did not discuss anything about foreign transaction fees in advance.
I think they are responsible for the costs of using the card they chose to use.
Do I owe them half of these charges? If so, I'll take my lumps. If not, how can I explain that card fees are not a shared expense?

 Goldman Heralds Another Return-to-Office Push. It's Different This Time. 
"
349,6-Sep-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk and Twitter Trade Barbs at Wide-Ranging Hearing; Among the issues the Delaware court is considering is the billionaire's request to add a whistleblower's allegations to his claims,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2709943111/BFD812D457A14912PQ/625?accountid=13946,"Lawyers for Elon Musk and Twitter Inc. ended a wide-ranging hearing over their stalled $44 billion deal debating the issue that may further complicate and extend their legal fight: whether Mr. Musk can incorporate a whistleblower's allegations into his countersuit.
Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick didn't rule on that or any of the other questions raised during the roughly three-and-a-half-hour oral arguments Tuesday, which included the pace and substance of the discovery process, Mr. Musk's motivations for seeking to exit from the deal and the timing of the trial, among other factors. She concluded the hearing only by saying both parties earned a good night's rest.
When it came to the question of amending Mr. Musk's countersuit, the discussion centered on the relevance of the claims by the whistleblower , Peiter Zatko, Twitter's former head of security, to the legal matter at hand.
Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Mr. Musk, pointed to Mr. Zatko's near-legendary status in the security industry and chastised Twitter for not disclosing what it knew about Mr. Zatko's accusations of ""egregious deficiencies"" related to privacy and digital security, among other alleged mismanagement. ""Justice is screaming out for an amendment here,"" he said. Mr. Spiro said the whistleblower claims could support Mr. Musk's allegations that Twitter committed fraud by misrepresenting the condition of its business and key metrics about the users on its platform.
Twitter's team countered by describing Mr. Zatko as a disgruntled former employee with an ax to grind and saying that his unsubstantiated complaints after a notably unsuccessful tenure shouldn't be included in the Delaware suit. Twitter's lawyer also said Mr. Zatko's work at the company wasn't related to the alleged undercounting of spam and bot accounts that Mr. Musk cited in his counterclaims.
 How Elon Musk Made His Fortune 
The scope of the hearing shows how contentious this legal battle has become and marks another escalation of the dispute, which has already taken a number of dramatic twists and turns . The outcome could grant or block access for either side to more emails, texts, data and legal claims, among other things.
 Twitter sued Mr. Musk in July over his attempt to walk away from their $44 billion merger agreement reached in April. Mr. Musk later filed a countersuit , accusing the company of misrepresenting the condition of its business and key metrics about the users on its platform.
A request to file an amended complaint is common and not typically challenged, said William Savitt, an attorney representing Twitter, during Tuesday's hearing. But he argued that adding the new whistleblower allegations were simply an attempt by Mr. Musk's attorneys to slow down the proceedings and to use the court system for a ""grueling fishing expedition"" to satisfy terminating the agreement.
""They are grinding us down to escape a truly expedited trial,"" Mr. Savitt said. Further, he said, there are no factual allegations to support the claims that Mr. Musk's side wants to add to his countersuit.
During Tuesday's hearing, both sides also traded barbs over Mr. Musk's motivation for seeking to exit from the deal, with Twitter's lawyers pointing to a text exchange dated May 8 between the Tesla Inc. CEO and a Morgan Stanley banker. After noting that Russian President Vladimir Putin was expected to make a speech the following day, amid his country's invasion of Ukraine, Mr. Musk wrote that it wouldn't make sense to buy Twitter if World War III were to break out, according to a copy of the message read aloud by Mr. Savitt.
Mr. Spiro responded by saying that any businessman would be anxious about the impact of a potential war on the stock market. He reiterated Mr. Musk's allegations that Twitter had hidden key information about its business.
Mr. Musk's team is seeking to push the trial to November. During the hearing, his attorneys argued that they need more time to prepare because Twitter has allegedly been slow to provide information they requested as part of the discovery process.
""It has been a game of hide and seek playing discovery with them,"" said Andrew Rossman, one of Mr. Musk's attorneys. ""It's blindingly obvious to us that the current schedule no longer works,"" he said.
Twitter attorney Bradley Wilson countered that the social-media company's team has been working around the clock to meet the defendant's demands, which he described as ""unreasonable."" He added that ""Twitter does not have anything to hide.""
Twitter's lawyers asked the judge to keep the current trial schedule , with a five-day nonjury trial scheduled to start Oct. 17.
""Every demand is overly broad, and Twitter is asked to boil the ocean again and again,"" said Mr. Savitt, Twitter's lawyer. He added that allowing the new allegations to be included would set a dangerous precedent because it would allow Mr. Musk to ""use it as an open-ended source for an escape hatch.""

350,7-Sep-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk Against Twitter: What to Know About Their Coming Trial; Fight over $44 billion takeover of social-media company heads to Delaware Chancery Court on Oct. 17,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2711018860/BFD812D457A14912PQ/340?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk and Twitter Inc. are to face off in Delaware Chancery Court starting Oct. 17, as the social-media company seeks to force the billionaire to complete his $44 billion takeover. The two sides have spent recent weeks seeking information to buttress their respective positions, sometimes appealing to the judge to make the other party comply with their demands. Here is what to know:
Why are Mr. Musk and Twitter fighting in court?
Mr. Musk gave notice on July 8 that he wanted out of the deal , arguing that Twitter hadn't provided the necessary data and information to assess the prevalence of fake or spam accounts on the platform. Days later, the social-media company sued Mr. Musk to enforce the deal at the earlier agreed-upon terms.
The roots of the saga date to late January, when Mr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc., quietly began buying Twitter stock. He was its largest individual investor by the time his stake became public in early April . He later moved to acquire the entire company with an eye toward taking it private. Twitter agreed to sell itself that month.
In the following weeks, Mr. Musk repeatedly voiced concerns about Twitter's management and the presence of spam bots and fake accounts on the platform. In May, Mr. Musk said he was putting the deal ""temporarily on hold"" until he received more information about the matter, though he also said was still committed to the transaction. Less than two months later he sought to pull the plug.
What do the two sides allege?
Twitter argues in its lawsuit that it complied with data requests from Mr. Musk and that he was using the spam bots as an excuse to get out of the deal after market conditions worsened, pinching his personal wealth .
""Rather than bear the cost of the market downturn, as the merger agreement requires, Musk wants to shift it to Twitter's stockholders,"" the company said.
Mr. Musk accuses Twitter of fraud . He said that he became concerned about the deal after Twitter restated some user numbers in April and after meeting with company executives in May to discuss how the platform measures spam and fake accounts. In a legal filing, Mr. Musk's side said he became dismayed at the company's process around such accounts, including the lack of automated tools to help with the calculation. He also alleges that Twitter made changes to the business, including certain personnel matters, that he should have been consulted on as the future owner.
Twitter argues that Mr. Musk failed to comply with aspects of the deal, including breaking nondisclosure terms.
What are spam bots?
Spam and fake accounts are an industrywide challenge for social-media companies. In many cases they are managed by what are known as bots, or automated software programs capable of quickly and widely disseminating posts. Such accounts hurt the experience for legitimate users, who see posts that they don't realize are generated by bots or otherwise under false pretenses.
Operators of bots have used fake accounts to incite violence, spread false information, deceptively attempt to influence political activity or achieve other illicit goals. Fake accounts can also make it harder for advertisers on social-media platforms to measure what they are getting for their money.
Twitter estimates that such accounts represent less than 5% of its monetizable daily average users, but says that the actual number could be higher. Mr. Musk argues that the figure is far higher.
Mr. Musk, who has more than 100 million followers on Twitter, likely has far greater exposure and experience with fake and spam accounts than most on the social-media platform, researchers say.
Mr. Musk waived due diligence in the deal process and has argued Twitter failed to furnish him the data to verify the number. Twitter said it has provided Mr. Musk ample data, but also that its accounting is difficult for outsiders to replicate .
The billionaire tweeted before the merger agreement was signed that it was his intention to ""defeat the spam bots or die trying!""

What is the Delaware Chancery Court?
The court is widely considered the nation's top tribunal for corporate takeover and merger disputes .
Twitter, like many companies, is incorporated in Delaware. Roughly two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies are domiciled there, according to its secretary of state. Twitter and Mr. Musk agreed to use the Chancery Court, or any state or federal court in Delaware, to settle disputes arising from his potential purchase of the microblogging website.
The Chancery Court, a nonjury trial court, calls itself the pre-eminent U.S. forum for legal cases involving the internal affairs of Delaware corporations and other business entities that conduct ""a vast amount of the world's commercial affairs.""
Who is to decide the fate of the Musk-Twitter deal?
Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick is to decide the case . She joined the Chancery Court in 2018 when it expanded to seven members from five. Named chancellor last year, she became the first woman to lead the court in its 230-year history.
Lawyers say Chancellor McCormick, who began her career as a legal-aid attorney, has a reputation for strong preparation, an ability to dissect complex corporate contracts, and a willingness to work around the clock when needed. In 2019, she steered a lawsuit challenging a takeover from start to finish in under two months, writing the 95-page decision over a weekend spent working at her house and office.
Chancellor McCormick is separately presiding over another multibillion-dollar lawsuit involving Mr. Musk. In that case, a Tesla shareholder alleges the board violated its fiduciary duties by awarding Mr. Musk a $56 billion compensation package in 2018. Tesla denies that. A trial is currently scheduled soon after the Twitter case.
What are the potential outcomes?
Twitter asked Chancellor McCormick to compel Mr. Musk to go through with the deal, the corporate equivalent of a shotgun wedding.
Alternatively, she could cut him loose by finding, as Mr. Musk alleges, that Twitter violated the merger agreement by misleading him about the prevalence of spam or fake accounts on its service.
Mr. Musk sold nearly $7 billion in Tesla stock in early August, citing uncertainty over the Twitter deal: ""In the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close and some equity partners don't come through, it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock.""
Twitter and Mr. Musk could also settle their dispute out of court.

What is Twitter's legal strategy?
In early August, Twitter issued subpoenas to several of Mr. Musk's Silicon Valley investors, friends and financial backers in search of communications from those people related to the deal. The company's goal is likely to determine whether Mr. Musk had other concerns about completing his agreement to buy the company, beyond what he has said publicly, according to lawyers and academics not involved in the case.
Twitter also sent subpoenas to at least a dozen banks for information on equity and debt financing and communications around the deal.
The subpoenas requested information and documents, including face-to-face conversations, physical mail, emails, text messages, instant messages, social-media contacts, facsimiles and phone conversations, according to court documents. Legal filings from Twitter show that the company is asking, among other things, for any documents and communications relating to fake or spam accounts.
Twitter might be searching for communications that would support its argument that Mr. Musk is balking because he lost more than $100 billion of his wealth amid the market downturn, lawyers and academics say. Mr. Musk pledged as much as $33 billion of his own money toward the deal.
What are Mr. Musk's counterclaims?
In early August Mr. Musk filed a countersuit against Twitter, accusing the company of misrepresenting the condition of its business and crucial metrics about the users on its platform.
Mr. Musk alleges that many Twitter users who are counted as monetizable don't add to the company's financial success, as the company represents, because most monetizable daily average users are served almost no ads.
Twitter responded to Mr. Musk's countersuit, saying Mr. Musk's claim that he was misled is implausible and that the billionaire doesn't have the right to back out based on his concerns over the number of spam or fake accounts on its platform.
Twitter also said that Mr. Musk hasn't identified a false or misleading statement in its regulatory disclosures, and that he is attempting to distort data and use litigation to undermine Twitter's business.
What does the Twitter whistleblower claim have to do with this?
Some of Mr. Musk's allegations were supported by a whistleblower complaint submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission in July by Twitter's former head of security , Peiter Zatko , who was fired earlier this year. Mr. Zatko, a former hacker known as ""Mudge,"" is a noted computer-security researcher. His submission, which was made public in late August, accuses Twitter of making misleading regulatory disclosures about spam and fake accounts.
In a late August hearing in Wilmington, Del., Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Mr. Musk, pointed to Mr. Zatko's whistleblower complaint to bolster his argument accusing Twitter of misleading shareholders with information Mr. Musk relied on when agreeing to the terms of the merger.
A legal filing made public on Aug. 29 shows that Mr. Musk's team sent a subpoena to Mr. Zatko, seeking documents and communications about how Twitter measures and deals with fake and spam accounts. It also requests information pertaining to reports about the company's alleged security vulnerabilities that were sent to Chief Executive Parag Agrawal or other executives and it calls for details on Mr. Zatko's departure from Twitter.
The subpoena proposes a deposition on Sept. 9. Debra Katz, an attorney representing Mr. Zatko, said that he would comply with the legal obligations of the subpoena and that his appearance at the deposition would be involuntary.
What impact could the whistleblower complaint have?
 The whistleblower complaint is separate from the merger dispute and there are differences between its arguments and those made by Mr. Musk. Still, it could be wielded to request more discovery, add fresh claims and provide new information about whether Mr. Musk had accurate details when he agreed to buy the company, according to legal scholars, litigators and lawyers following the case.
On Aug. 30, a securities filing showed that Mr. Musk's lawyers sent a new letter to Twitter updating their grounds for terminating the deal in response to Mr. Zatko's complaint. The letter states that the allegations in it, if true, would demonstrate a breach by Twitter of certain provisions of the merger agreement, constituting a ""material adverse effect.""
Twitter responded with a letter saying it hasn't breached any of its obligations under its merger agreement with Mr. Musk. In the letter, disclosed the same day in a securities filing, the company also repeated that it intends to enforce the deal at the agreed-upon terms and price and that the statements made in Mr. Zatko's complaint are ""riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lack important context.""
Separately, Twitter said in a statement that it hasn't suffered and isn't likely to suffer a ""material adverse effect.""
Meanwhile, Mr. Musk's lawyers also filed a proposed order in Delaware Chancery Court on Aug. 30 asking the judge for permission to amend the billionaire's countersuit and to push the trial to November from October.
The Delaware judge on Sept. 7 ruled Mr. Musk can amend his countersuit to incorporate allegations from a whistleblower complaint, while denying his request to push back a trial over the deal to November.
Chancellor McCormick made the decision a day after an hourslong hearing in which lawyers for Twitter and Mr. Musk each offered oral arguments over whether to include Mr. Zatko's allegations, as well as over several other pending requests for data and information.

It's Designed to Keep Consumers Spending.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2711213439/BFD812D457A14912PQ/562?accountid=13946,"Never mind better battery life or a fancier camera, the biggest innovation from Apple's latest product launch was a price freeze .
It says much about the U.S. economy in 2022 that the consumer electronics company most adept at extracting cash from its legion of fans is choosing not to hike prices, holding the cost of its iPhone 14 range at the level of its predecessor.
Even in a cost-of-living crisis, affluent customers are still opening their wallets . Holding prices while inflation ramps up costs looks like a valuable positive Apple is able to offer having taking greater control of its supply chain, including microchip design.
What may be seen as a goodwill gesture removes one reason for not upgrading handsets as the company seeks to protect its $200 billion franchise that accounts for half of group sales a full 15 years after it sold its first phone.
Apple has been gaining share over Android rivals in the U.S., but globally it still lags Samsung volumes by some way. Some analysts think Apple is vulnerable to recession , and the shares have been losing altitude since mid-August, in common with Nasdaq's reverse.
Gartner expects global smartphone shipments to decline 5.8% this year. Nor is 2023 brighter, with Samsung's chip arm sharing a downbeat outlook .
That's the year Apple fans hope to see the debut of a mixed reality headset. Brand affection is such that there is also strong interest in an Apple car, even though there is no sign of one about to launch.
Overseas Apple buyers aren't as fortunate as those in the U.S., however.
In the U.K., where sterling has hit its lowest level against the dollar since 1985, consumers must pay up to £150 ($172) more for an iPhone 14 Pro compared to the price of last year's flagship device.

Hawkish Fed Has Goldman Lifting Rate Hike Forecast
Goldman Sachs raised its forecast for Federal Reserve interest rate hikes late Wednesday. It now sees a 75 basis point hike later this month, citing a number of hawkish comments from Fed officials in recent weeks.
* The bank's analysts also lifted their expectations for November's meeting, forecasting a 50 basis point hike. The U.S. lender had previously expected a 50 basis point hike in September followed by a 25 basis point rise in November. Goldman stuck to its forecast for a 25 basis point hike in December, seeing the fed-funds rate at 3.75% to 4% by the year end.
* Fed officials have sounded hawkish recently and have seemed to imply that progress toward taming inflation has not been as uniform or as rapid as they would like,"" the analysts, led by Jan Hatzius said in a note.
* Vice Chair Lael Brainard's comments Wednesday were among those noted by Goldman. ""We are in this for as long as it takes to get inflation down. So far, we have expeditiously raised the policy rate to the peak of the previous cycle, and the policy rate will need to rise further,"" she said.
* Goldman analysts said the market was now pricing in a hike path of 75 basis points, then 50 basis points and then 25 basis points, in September, November and December.
What's Next: The Fed will meet on September 20-21 to determine the immediate future path of interest rates. The market is becoming increasingly confident that the central bank will hike by 75 basis points.

GameStop and FTX to Work Together on E-Commerce Projects
GameStop has a new deal with cryptocurrency exchange FTX, though it was light on the financial details during its earnings report. The announcement says the tie-up is intended to introduce more GameStop customers to FTX's community and its marketplaces for digital assets.
* The two are going to work together on new e-commerce and online marketing projects, and GameStop said it would begin carrying FTX gift cards in select stores. GameStop will be FTX's preferred retail partner in the United States.
* FTX surged in popularity during last year's Bitcoin price rally. It has naming rights for the arena that is home to the NBA's Miami Heat, and its brand ambassadors include Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady and tennis pro Naomi Osaka.
* GameStop has also been jumping into nonfungible tokens, rolling out a marketplace and a GameStop digital wallet so people can use their crypto holdings to buy, sell and trade NFTs. Sales of collectibles rose 26% from last year's quarter.
* The retailer reported an overall drop in quarterly sales, but the loss for the quarter was smaller than expected. Revenue was $1.14 billion, which was below consensus . Hardware and accessories sales fell 2% from last year, software sales fell 20%.
What's Next: A congressional committee set Sept. 12 as the deadline for FTX, Coinbase and other digital asset exchanges, to respond to a request for documents and information showing how they safeguard consumers from fraud.

United Airlines Sees Demand Continuing, Lifting Its Outlook
United Airlines says after a robust summer for travel, it sees demand for plane seats continuing, and raised its third-quarter revenue outlook. The carrier now expects total operating revenue to be 12% higher than 2019 levels compared with an earlier forecast for an 11% gain.
* United expects more capacity, while cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel, will be 16% higher than in 2019, the lower end of its previous forecast. Operating margins will also improve, though fuel prices will increase to $3.83 a gallon from $3.81.
* The carrier has threatened to suspend service at New York's John F. Kennedy airport after October unless the Federal Aviation Administration grants it more takeoff and landing slots, in an internal email seen by Barron's. The FAA said it must determine how it would affect nearby airports, Bloomberg reported.
* Passengers are booking trips to Mexico, the Caribbean and Europe and paying more for premium economy seats, according to Patrick Quayle, United's senior vice president of global network planning and alliances, who spoke at a Cowen investor conference.
* American Airlines CEO Robert Isom told the same conference that leisure bookings remain strong even after Labor Day. Revenue from business travelers, including larger companies such as investment banks and consulting firms, remains at 75% of 2019 levels, The Wall Street Journal reported .
What's Next: Some analysts and industry observers remain skeptical the trend can continue. ""My guess is that heading into a recession, it's going to be difficult to sustain the performance of the summer,"" said Eric Bernardini, head of the aviation practice at AlixPartners consultancy.

Netflix Cutting Costs Companywide After Losing One Million Viewers
Netflix is slashing costs after losing more than one million viewers in the June quarter. It laid off more than 400 employees this year, trimmed its real estate holdings, reduced corporate swag, and wants to control rising cloud-computing costs with Amazon Web Services, The Wall Street Journal reported .
* After years of rapid growth and spending, Netflix is trying to contain costs while building its subscriber base to up to 500 million customers globally in the next three years, people familiar with the situation told the Journal.
* Netflix is saving on salaries by hiring more interns and recent college graduates; closing its Salt Lake City office and giving up space in Los Angeles and Los Gatos, Calif.; and limiting employees to $300 worth of Netflix-branded coffee mugs, sweatshirts, and baby onesies a year.
* In technology, Netflix is exploring reducing the copies of stored data and content and curbing investments in internally developed software. It told studio group employees to mind the number of pricey software licenses they buy, the Journal reported.
* Streaming services such as Netflix have been a competitive threat to movie theater operators since the pandemic started. Regal Cinemas owner Cineworld Group filed for bankruptcy, seeking to reorganize as it tries to weather a light calendar of new releases that is weighing on ticket sales.
What's Next: Analysts are torn on whether Netflix's cheaper, ad-supported streaming subscription will boost results. Bank of America says it could cut into revenue as customers trade down. Macquarie estimates it could generate up to $3.6 billion in ad sales by 2025.

Elon Musk Wins Some and Loses Some in Court Hearing
Elon Musk will be allowed to amend his countersuit against Twitter to include information from the whistleblower complaint by Twitter's former head of security, Peiter Zatko, that accused Twitter of deceiving its board and regulators about its vulnerabilities to hackers.
* Legal experts said the accusations in the complaint could potentially strengthen Musk's case accusing Twitter of misrepresenting the company's business, but that it's too early to know whether it could help the Tesla CEO avoid following through with his $44 billion purchase.
* Musk wants to terminate the agreement, saying Twitter's disclosures about monetizable daily active users undercount the prevalence of spam bots on its platform and affects Twitter's value. Twitter, which has said less than 5% of its monetizable daily active users are fake, denied that claim.
* Twitter's lawyers cast Zatko as a disgruntled former employee whose job and previous criticisms of the company weren't related to the number of spam accounts, adding that his ""parroting"" of Musk's allegations in his complaint was ""very, very strange,"" The Wall Street Journal reported.
What's Next: Delaware Chancery Judge Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick denied Musk's request to push back the trial to November from Oct. 17, saying the risk of further harm to Twitter by delaying was ""too great to justify.""

Kids as young as 12 can work long hours on farms. Should that be allowed?
Norma Flores López was 12 when she began working 10- to 12-hour days, every day of the week.
Because that grueling work occurred on a farm, it was allowed. Kids in the U.S. can take on unlimited hours of agricultural labor so long as they don't miss school and have a parent's permission.
In other industries, children typically cannot work until they're at least 14 years old, and even then they're subjected to limited hours.

353,14-Sep-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Twitter Investors Clear Sale As Whistleblower Testifies,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2713893138/BFD812D457A14912PQ/626?accountid=13946,"WASHINGTON -- Twitter Inc. shareholders approved the $44 billion takeover that Elon Musk is trying to abandon on the same day that a whistleblower alleged at a hearing on Capitol Hill that the social-media company misled regulators about security failures.
Former Twitter security executive Peiter Zatko, who was fired by the company in January, told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday that Twitter executives' ""incentives led them to prioritize profits over security,"" echoing his whistleblower complaint.
Twitter has pushed back against his charges and said he was making misleading statements. He was called before the committee to provide more information on his assertions.
Democrats and Republicans have raised concerns about social-media companies in recent years over how they use and protect customer data. ""Twitter is an immensely powerful platform that cannot afford gaping security vulnerabilities,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, chairman of the Judiciary Committee and a Democrat from Illinois, said in opening remarks at the hearing.
Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the committee's top Republican, said: ""The whistleblower disclosures paint a very disturbing picture of a company that's solely focused on profits at any expense, including at the expense of the safety and security of its users.""
Mr. Grassley said Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal declined to answer questions at the hearing, citing the ongoing litigation over Mr. Musk's takeover bid of the company. The senator added the allegations raised questions about the CEO's leadership.
Democrats and Republicans raised concerns about user data potentially being exposed to foreign intelligence agencies. Mr. Zatko at the hearing reiterated his claims that foreign agents working for Chinese and other governments might be employed at the company. Last month, a former Twitter employee was found guilty of spying for Saudi Arabia by accessing private user information in exchange for money.
Twitter's security team ""had been contacted and told that there was at least one agent of the MSS, which is one of China's intelligence services, on the payroll inside Twitter,"" Mr. Zatko said. The Chinese Embassy in Washington didn't respond to a request for comment.
Twitter said the hearing showed Mr. Zatko's allegations were ""riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies,"" a company spokeswoman said. She said Twitter's hiring process is independent of any foreign interference and that it undertakes measures such as background checks, access controls and monitoring systems to safeguard data.
Mr. Zatko has become a factor in the legal drama unfolding over Mr. Musk's effort to walk away from the Twitter takeover. Twitter sued the billionaire in July over his attempt to renege on the deal. Mr. Musk filed a countersuit, accusing the company of misrepresenting the condition of its business and key metrics about the users on its platform.
Twitter has argued Mr. Musk got cold feet after market conditions deteriorated. Last week, Mr. Musk got court approval to amend his suit to include aspects of Mr. Zatko's assertions.
Even as he expressed concerns about the platform, Mr. Zatko, at the hearing, called Twitter ""a hugely valuable service.""
The case is being fought out in Delaware Chancery Court, with a five-day nonjury trial set to start Oct. 17.
In a ruling Tuesday, the judge overseeing the suit denied Twitter's request for emails sent by Mr. Musk through addresses at two companies he helms: Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX. Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick said Mr. Musk had a reasonable expectation of privacy when corresponding about the deal.
Twitter shareholders approved the takeover offer, with 98.6% of votes cast at a special meeting in favor of the deal, based on a preliminary tally of votes, the company said after polling closed Tuesday. The transaction is for $54.20 per share.
Twitter shares rose after the vote Tuesday and closed at $41.74.
Saudi Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, who agreed to roll his nearly 5% stake into the deal before Mr. Musk's change of heart, voted his shares in favor of the deal, according to a person familiar with the matter.
While his vote wasn't crucial with the largest shareholders including index-fund managers supporting the deal, it is notable because he has been aligned with Mr. Musk as one of the 19 investors who agreed to help him finance the deal.
Mr. Musk didn't vote his shares, according to people familiar with the matter.
An attorney for Mr. Musk didn't offer a detailed response to the Senate hearing or the vote, but said he hopes the truth will come out in court.
The billionaire on Tuesday said on Twitter his tweets were being suppressed, without providing evidence. Twitter didn't respond to a request for comment on Mr. Musk's assertion.
If the judge were to force Mr. Musk to consummate the transaction, he could be on the hook for more than $33 billion in equity financing, according to a regulatory filing.
Mr. Zatko filed his complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, which are expected to investigate.
Mr. Zatko was hired by Twitter in 2020 after a hack of some high-profile users' accounts, including then-presidential candidate Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama, as well as Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos and Mr. Musk.
Mr. Zatko said he was fired after clashing repeatedly with top executives over the depth of the company's security problems.
Twitter has said Mr. Zatko was fired ""for ineffective leadership and poor performance"" and that his whistleblower complaint ""is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context.""

354,16-Sep-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"This Billionaire Is Now Even Richer Than Jeff Bezos; Indian industrialist Gautam Adani surpassed Amazon founder to become world's second-richest person, trailing only Elon Musk",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2714956880/BFD812D457A14912PQ/496?accountid=13946,"Jeff Bezos is no longer the second-richest person in the world.
The Amazon.com Inc. founder was overtaken Friday by Indian industrialist Gautam Adani, whose net worth sits at $147 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index , a ranking of the world's richest people.
Mr. Adani now only trails Elon Musk, who remains the world's richest person by a wide margin. He has a net worth of $264 billion, according to Bloomberg.
The shake-up in the rankings of the world's richest people comes as stocks have slumped this year amid rising interest rates and rising inflation . Many of the world's wealthiest people have at least some of their net worth tied up in the financial markets, meaning volatility in stocks and other holdings can sway their measures of wealth. The S&P 500 is down 19% this year and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has fared worse, falling 27%.
Establishing the exact net worth of the world's wealthiest can also be tricky, in part because many of their holdings are private.
Mr. Adani, 60 years old, is the chairman of Adani Group, an India-based conglomerate involved in initiatives including green energy, power and gas distribution. He net worth reached $100 billion in April. Later that month, his personal wealth exceeded that of Warren Buffett. 
He is the first person from Asia who has ranked so high on Bloomberg's wealth index, long dominated by U.S. tech entrepreneurs.
Mr. Adani's net worth has climbed by $70 billion this year, as shares of his conglomerate's publicly traded businesses have risen. His push into green energy comes as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stressed development for infrastructure and renewable energy.
Earlier this year, his company struck a deal of as much as $10.5 billion to acquire control of two Indian-listed cement companies . He has called his firm's push into the cement industry ""yet another validation of our belief in our nation's growth story.""
Mr. Adani's rise up the wealth ladder is a contrast from many of the world's richest people. Nine of the 10 wealthiest individuals have seen their net worth drop this year; Mr. Adani is the only one whose wealth has risen, according to Bloomberg's ranking.
Mr. Bezos stepped down from chief executive of Amazon last year and is now the company's executive chairman. He owns almost 10% of Amazon's shares outstanding as of Aug. 24, according to FactSet. Amazon's stock has lost more than a quarter of its value so far this year, contributing to Mr. Bezos' $45.5 billion decline in wealth. He also founded the privately held space company Blue Origin LLC.
The net worth of Mr. Musk, who runs Tesla Inc. and who also founded space exploration company SpaceX, has fallen $6.4 billion this year. Mr. Musk has been embroiled in a messy deal to buy Twitter Inc. Twitter shareholders this week approved the $44 billion takeover deal that Mr. Musk has been trying to abandon . Mr. Musk and the company are embroiled in a legal fight over the deal's future.
Messrs. Bezos and Musk have interacted on Twitter in the past. Mr. Musk has poked fun at the Amazon founder when he surpassed him in net worth last year.
Amazon and Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment on behalf of Messrs. Bezos and Musk, respectively. Adani Group didn't respond to a request for comment on behalf of its chairman.

355,27-Sep-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk and Twitter Argue Over Unresolved Pretrial Information Requests; Remote hearing is held before the judge who will preside over nonjury proceedings in less than three weeks,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2718085467/BFD812D457A14912PQ/498?accountid=13946,"Lawyers for Elon Musk and Twitter Inc. debated several pending requests for information in their continuing legal fight, with less than three weeks to go before a scheduled trial over Mr. Musk's soured $44 billion takeover.
Among the issues discussed were whether Mr. Musk's team should have access to certain documents that Twitter has claimed are protected by attorney-client privilege and the proposed terms around allowing Mr. Musk to incorporate details about a Twitter whistleblower's settlement payment into his argument for terminating the deal.
Mr. Musk, the CEO of Tesla Inc., has sought more information about how Twitter counts fake and spam accounts, which he alleges are more prevalent on the platform than the company acknowledges. Twitter disputes Mr. Musk's claims and says he is using his complaints as a pretext to try to get out of the deal after market conditions worsened.
Twitter's legal team, in turn, said they have asked for any research from data scientists on which Mr. Musk based his claims about spam and fake accounts. But Mr. Musk's team hasn't shared research supporting his claims, Twitter's legal team said Tuesday.
In response, Mr. Musk's team said Twitter's lawyers raised new issues during the hearing and they needed time to respond.
Twitter has handed over a ""historical snapshot"" of about 9,000 accounts tied to a quarterly audit, according to court filings. Mr. Musk's team has asked for additional details about those accounts, including data regarding any account suspensions.
The hearing, at times contentious, was held remotely via Zoom on Tuesday. The public portion of the hearing lasted more than three hours. The hearing ended with the judge still considering several issues, including disputes over whether some documents were protected by attorney-client privilege.
Twitter's team, during the hearing, also said Mr. Musk had failed to produce required texts and other kinds of electronic messages. Mr. Musk's legal team disputed Twitter's allegation.
Delaware Chancery Court Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, the presiding judge, has kept the case on a fast track, scheduling a five-day nonjury trial starting Oct. 17. That gave both sides roughly three months to prepare for the case, and they have been jockeying for preliminary legal advantage by gathering documents and sworn testimony. Mr. Musk and Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal are among those expected to be deposed. Twitter's lawyers proposed interviewing Mr. Musk over two days beginning Oct. 6, according to a court filing.
During Tuesday's proceedings, Chancellor McCormick at times sharply interjected. ""Skip the rhetoric and go to the meat,"" she said at one point to Mr. Musk's team, which was rejecting Twitter's accusation that Mr. Musk hadn't sufficiently produced electronic messages.
 How Elon Musk Made His Fortune 
The Tesla CEO was a millionaire in his 20s and has parlayed each business success into new endeavors
Mr. Musk's team has pressed for a range of information from Twitter, including employee communications and granular data about spam and fake accounts. While the judge has granted some of Mr. Musk's requests, she has denied others and once called his team's data requests ""absurdly broad.""
Twitter has said it didn't object to Mr. Musk including details of its settlement with whistleblower Peiter Zatko, its former head of security, but requested that Mr. Musk's team produce certain documents concerning Mr. Zatko if they possess them.
Mr. Musk's team said Tuesday they are reviewing documents that might relate to Mr. Zatko.
Whistleblower Aid, a group that helped file the whistleblower claims, has said Mr. Zatko didn't speak with Mr. Musk before making his complaint.
Mr. Zatko alleged that Twitter misled federal regulators and investors about security and privacy failures. Twitter has said Mr. Zatko's claims are inaccurate and that he was fired in January for poor performance.

356,30-Sep-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk Slated to Unveil Humanoid Robot Optimus at Tesla's AI Day; Prototype seen as CEO's effort to shape perception of the company as more than just a car maker,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2719445283/BFD812D457A14912PQ/200?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk aims to show off a new humanoid robot Friday at a Tesla Inc. artificial intelligence event, part of the chief executive's effort to shape public perception of the company as more than an electric-vehicle maker .
Mr. Musk first laid out the vision for the robot , called Optimus, a little more than a year ago at Tesla's first-ever AI day. At the time, a dancer in a costume appeared onstage. This time, Mr. Musk has said he wants a prototype to be at the gathering in Palo Alto, Calif., with a videostream broadcast starting at 6:15 p.m. local time.
Mr. Musk, hours ahead of the event, retweeted a Tesla-provided image showing robotic arms, saying they were ""The hands of Optimus"" and not a computer animation.
The Tesla boss has painted a vision of Optimus as helping Tesla make cars more efficiently. He has also suggested the robot could serve broader functions and potentially alleviate labor shortages.
""My guess is Optimus will be more valuable than the car long term,"" Mr. Musk said Aug. 4 at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting. ""It will, I think, turn the whole notion of what's an economy on its head, at the point at which you have no shortage of labor,"" he added.
When he first unveiled the Optimus concept, Mr. Musk said such a robot could have such an impact on the labor market it could make it necessary to provide a universal basic income, or a stipend to people without strings attached.
Tesla has also encountered problems with automation . Early efforts to rely heavily on automated tools to scale up vehicle production suffered setbacks, and the company had to rely more heavily than planned on factory workers. Mr. Musk later tweeted: ""Yes, excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated.""
Mr. Musk, who has been instrumental in popularizing electric vehicles and pioneered landing rocket boosters with his company SpaceX, also has a record of making bold predictions that don't immediately pan out. Three years ago at an event about automation, he projected that more than a million Tesla vehicles would be able to operate without a driver by the middle of 2020, positioning the company to launch a robot taxi service. That hasn't happened.
Mr. Musk said Optimus might be a tool to be rented on an hourly basis and take on menial tasks around the home.
One of the big questions around Tesla's humanoid robot is its central purpose, said Chris Atkeson, a Carnegie Mellon University robotics professor. If Tesla's main goal is to improve manufacturing, a quadruped likely would have been easier to build than a humanoid robot, in part because additional legs make it easier to balance, he said.
Mr. Musk for some time has said Tesla aimed to be more than just a car company.
Mr. Musk billed the latest event, like last year's, as one aimed at recruiting engineers in fields such as artificial intelligence, robotics and chips.
Tesla has long bet on automation to keep the company ahead of competitors. The company's cars are outfitted with an advanced driver-assistance system, known as Autopilot, that helps drivers with tasks such as maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles on the road and staying centered in a lane.
The company is developing and selling an enhanced version of Autopilot that brings more automated driving into cities. Tesla calls the system Full Self-Driving, or FSD, although it doesn't actually make vehicles autonomous and the company tells drivers to keep their hands on the wheel while operating the car. Tesla has steadily raised the price of FSD, which now retails for $15,000. AI has been at the heart of Tesla's efforts to develop more advanced driver-assistance features and, eventually, fully autonomous vehicles.
Tesla's pursuit of automation has increasingly come under scrutiny. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which regulates auto safety, opened a probe into Autopilot last year after a series of crashes involving Teslas that struck first-responder vehicles stopped for roadway emergencies.
Two U.S. senators have also asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether Tesla has been deceptive in its marketing of Autopilot and FSD.
The electric-car maker has long said that driving with Autopilot engaged is safer than doing so without it. Tesla points to internal data showing that crashes were less common when drivers were using Autopilot, though some researchers have criticized the company's methodology.

The robot took a few steps, waved to the crowd, and performed some basic dance moves.
Mr. Musk quipped the robot could do a lot more, but limited its activity for fear it could fall on its face. The robot's appearance on stage marked the first time it operated without a tether, Mr. Musk said. ""Our goal is to make a useful humanoid robot as quickly as possible,"" he said, with the aspiration of being able to make them at high volume and low cost. ""It is expected to cost much less than a car,"" he said, with a price point below $20,000.
He later showed off a nonfunctioning model that he said was closer to the production model.

358,2-Oct-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Tesla Deliveries Bounce Back to Record, Though Dented by Distribution Delays; Elon Musk's auto maker requires another boost in quarterly deliveries to meet annual target",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2720098063/BFD812D457A14912PQ/170?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc. vehicle deliveries rebounded to a record in the most recent quarter, though the figure was short of Wall Street's forecasts and leaves the company requiring a further increase in the final three months of 2022 to meet annual growth objectives.
Tesla on Sunday said it had delivered 343,830 vehicles to customers in the three-month period ended in September, up from about 255,000 in the prior quarter that was dented by a temporary shutdown of its factory in China .
Deliveries were up roughly 42% from last year's third quarter, when Tesla handed over 241,000 vehicles. Analysts surveyed by FactSet forecast that Tesla would deliver around 371,000 vehicles in the third quarter.
Tesla signaled the delivery shortfall reflected changes it is making to its processes which, it said, ""led to an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter.""
The adjustment, the company said, was necessary because as production volumes grow, vehicle transportation capacity is ""becoming increasingly challenging to secure"" at a reasonable cost during the last few weeks of the quarter, when its shipments typically surge.
""Customer experience suffers when there is an end of quarter rush. Steady as she goes is the right move,"" Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted on Sunday.
The rebound in deliveries was more muted than expected, which could revive concerns among some investors that demand for Teslas may be softening amid economic upheaval and increased competition in the electric-vehicle market. Mr. Musk has said the company is production-constrained , not demand-limited.
Tesla may be facing ""incremental demand softness,"" reflected, in part, by lower wait times for some models, particularly in China, Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi Jr. said in a note, adding that the company's order backlog remains ""unequivocally strong.""
Tesla has a long-term goal to increase output by an average of 50% annually and, in July, said that was still attainable despite production disruptions. To reach that level, Tesla would need to roughly deliver a record-setting 495,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter. Wall Street thinks the company will struggle to reach 1.4 million , per FactSet, and deliver 457,000 vehicles in the final three months of this year. Mr. Sacconaghi said he expects deliveries will grow about 45% this year.
Rival car makers also have had issues around delivering vehicles to customers, largely driven by supply-chain disruptions and semiconductor shortages.
At the same time, Tesla's competitors have been trying to boost output of EVs to satisfy growing appetite for such cars amid high fuel prices and U.S. government incentives to foster adoption of EVs. President Biden over the summer signed a law that includes incentives for buying EVs and making them domestically.
Tesla has been ramping up output to keep pace with surging demand and to recover from the idling of the Shanghai factory, its largest, because of local Covid-19 restrictions earlier this year. Tesla also had trouble getting its new factories in Germany and Texas up to speed.
""These factories don't just magically work,"" Mr. Musk said at the company's annual shareholder meeting in August. ""So still a lot of work to do.""
To keep pace with customer orders, Tesla has boosted production capacity across its plants in the U.S., Europe and China. The company made 365,923 vehicles in the third quarter, up from about 238,000 in the year-earlier period.
Tesla in July said its capacity expansion had given it the nominal ability to produce about 1.9 million vehicles over a 12-month period, though those volumes remained constrained by supply-chain challenges. Mr. Musk, on the July earnings call, said Tesla could end the year able to produce 40,000 vehicles a week.
The company on Saturday said weekly production capacity at its Berlin plant had reached 2,000 Model Ys after it opened in March.
Mr. Musk also has said Tesla is likely to need roughly a dozen factories to reach its goal of selling 20 million vehicles annually by 2030.
Tesla's record third-quarter deliveries are expected to help the company post its highest ever quarterly sales and a record profit of $3.34 billion when it reports third-quarter results, topping the $3.32 billion first quarter profit. Quarterly results are scheduled for Oct. 19, Tesla said. Mr. Musk is due in court in Delaware that week in his battle with Twitter Inc. over his efforts to abandon the $44 billion takeover of the social-media company he agreed to in April.
In the most recent quarter, Tesla delivered roughly 325,158 combined Model 3 sedans and Model Y compact sport-utility vehicles during the third quarter, up from about 232,000 from the year-earlier period. The company delivered 18,672 of its luxury Model S sedans and Model X SUVs, up from nearly 9,300 last year.
Tesla on Friday unveiled a prototype of its humanoid robot, called Optimus , that Mr. Musk says could be available for wider purchase in three to five years and cost less than $20,000. He also detailed plans for Tesla to further expand its advanced driver-assistance technology, among other initiatives, at the company's second AI Day.
Shares of Tesla are down about 25% this year with inflation soaring and supply-chain disruptions weighing on wider investor sentiment. Mr. Musk's bid for Twitter also has weighed on Tesla's stock. Mr. Musk has sold some Tesla shares to pay for the transaction he is trying to abandon.
Mr. Musk previously expressed concern about the global economy but struck a more optimistic tone at the shareholder meeting in August.
""I think inflation is going to drop rapidly,"" Mr. Musk said, noting that because Tesla has to buy supplies months out, it can see where prices are headed. ""The interesting thing that we're seeing now is that most of our commodities, most of the things that go into a Tesla—not all but more than half—the prices are trending down in six months.""

 Tesla Deliveries Bounce Back to Record, Though Dented by Distribution Delays

359,3-Oct-22,USA Today (Online),Elon Musk says 'population collapse' is a bigger threat than climate change. Is he right?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2720317590/BFD812D457A14912PQ/698?accountid=13946,"At the Cannes Film Festival this summer, many attendees reveled at the ""Top Gun"" reboot, a throwback to the past. But on the sidelines a smaller crowd witnessed something more solemn: the possibility of a dark and tragic future. ""Plan 75,"" a film by Japanese director Hayakawa Chie, explores the potential dangers of her country's aging society, where nearly one-in-three people are currently 65 or older. Set in a near-future dystopia, the film depicts a nation whose healthcare and pensions systems have become so overburdened by the elderly that the government aggressively markets a policy to pay for final bucket list items and then euthanize anyone over 75. While technically the stuff of science fiction, demographers say the film arrives at a time when humanity really is aging.  The global fertility rate has decreased by half since 1960. In countries responsible for 85% of the world's gross domestic product – the United States, Germany, Japan, even China and India – births have fallen below the “replacement rate,” meaning that unless offset by immigration, population will begin to decline as older generations depart. The United Nations calculates the world population will now peak in 2084, before starting to fall by the century's end. More: US, world population to shrink after midcentury, study suggests In a world where economies are designed around growth and social systems depend on the young supporting the old, forward thinkers are beginning to wonder what comes next. Consider Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and business magnate, now most prominent among their ranks. “Population collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming,” Musk wrote on Twitter this summer. “Mark these words.”  But is he right? Population concerns are nothing new For centuries, humans have pondered the ideal size of humanity. But experts warn such efforts usually end in folly, and that our species has within its grasp solutions to prosper whether populations rise or fall. “It's up to us and how the world responds,” said Lauren Johnston, a professor at the University of Sydney's China Studies Centre and economic demographer. For much of the last few centuries, those fretting about overpopulation have had the spotlight. In 1798, English scholar Thomas Malthus published an influential essay that laid out an idea known as the “Malthusian trap,” which holds that population growth inevitably exceeds food and other resources, leading to famine and poverty. The work inspired anxiety in England and helped lead to the first national census of England, Scotland and Wales.  Such concerns echoed loudly in 1968, when Stanford University professor Paul Ehrlich and wife Anne Ehrlich published ""The Population Bomb,"" a book that predicted global famine leading to the deaths of hundreds of millions of people within decades. But most experts say such predictions have not come to pass. Particularly in the past 50 years, a “Green Revolution” in agriculture has used new farming methods to reap more calories per acre of land, leading world hunger to decrease even as the population doubled. More: A new threat emerges for US lakes and rivers. Your lawn or toilet may be partly to blame. Although studies show such practices have created additional problems – driving water pollution, contributing to climate change, and perhaps even decreasing the nutritional value of food – Johnston points out that many nations are now facing the opposite of starvation. “In most countries there has been a sufficiently productive response to population growth that there hasn't been a famine,” Johnston said. “Now there's obesity.” Underpopulation on the horizon? As concern over having too many mouths to feed has waned, an opposing one has risen: too few people to work. That's an especially obvious worry in China, which infamously implemented a one-child policy in 1980 to address exponential population growth projections. Its current population of 1.4 billion remains the world's largest. But realizing the aging trajectory of its society, in 2016 China eliminated the policy and has also limited pensions and social programs for the elderly, Johnston said. Many other nations are or soon will be facing similar challenges. To maintain a steady population without immigration, a nation has to achieve a fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman, experts say. But the fertility rate is just 1.7 in China and Brazil, 1.5 across the European Union, and 0.8 in South Korea, the lowest of any country, according to the World Bank. The rate is 1.6 in the United States, where the population is still rising only due to longer lifespans and immigration, which is projected to outpace natural births by 2030. Globally, it's primarily African nations like Nigeria, where the fertility rate is 5.2, that are contributing to population growth. But as those nations develop, some experts expect fertility rates to fall as well, contributing to the possibility of unprecedented global population decline. “There's never been anything close to a parallel,” Johnston said. Some experts are ringing alarm bells on what that could mean for societies.  In their book ""Reversal: Ageing Societies, Waning Inequality, and an Inflation Revival,"" economists Charles Goodhart and Manoj Pradhan warn of mounting fiscal crises, ""as medical, care, and pension expenditures all increase in our ageing societies."" Nations could wind up burning the candle at both ends: as a higher percentage of people become retirees they require more public resources, while at the same time the taxable working population shrinks. Problems could be exacerbated as rates of Alzheimer's and other costly elder illnesses increase, while labor shortages create inflationary pressures. As countries face these challenges, their societies and politics could destabilize. ""Our view of the future is not encouraging, but it is coherent and plausible,"" Goodhart and Pradhan write. So Musk is right? Not so fast, says Daniel Kammen, a professor of sustainability at the University of California, Berkeley and former Science Envoy to the U.S. State Department. While aging societies do pose possible challenges in the future, Kammen says the world is facing a current full-blown crisis right now: climate change. And adding more people to the Earth's population will only further complicate humanity's lagging efforts to fight global warming, experts say. “There's no ideal number, but certainly I would say there are too many people on our planet for our current lifestyle,” Kammen said. Kammen believes the entire conversation about population is a red herring, a view commonly held among population experts. Instead, he says the focus should be on whether or not countries are wisely using resources. That's when the wealth of nations like the U.S., and not their population, come into focus. A study in the journal Nature Sustainability this year found that the world's wealthiest 10% of people produce 47% of its carbon emissions, compared to just 10% of emissions for the entire bottom half of the economic ladder. To put it another way, World Bank data shows the average Nigerian's carbon footprint is 0.6 metric tons each year. With the globe currently emitting about 34 billion metric tons of CO2 annually, that means it could currently support 58 billion people if they had a Nigerian carbon footprint. On the other hand, the average American uses 14.7 metric tons of CO2 each year, meaning the world could support just 2.3 billion people if everyone had an American footprint. The same effect can be seen within countries. While many Americans believe that population-dense cities hold the most blame for carbon emissions, work from Kammen and his colleagues show the carbon footprints of urban Americans are actually substantially less than rural residents, with suburban residents surpassing both. That's true both on a per capita basis and in total: about half of U.S. carbon emissions come from suburban settings, while less than a third come from urban. Ultimately, Kammen said, the question is how to reduce resource footprints, especially in wealthy nations. The smaller they get, the more people the planet can support. “While it sure seems like there are a lot of people on our planet, our individual impact is much more measured by the ways in which we amplify or minimize our footprint,” Kammen said. “If you make it about population, you avoid how critical our patterns of consumption are.” Experts also say the challenges of population decline are not insurmountable.  Johnston says it will come down to smart planning and cooperation. If populations do peak and fall, governments can mitigate the repercussions by sharing resources more equitably. That will likely include sacrifices among the older generations. Not with their lives as ""Plan 75"" depicts, but through higher retirement ages and adjustments to pensions and benefits. Other experts note that it may be possible to maintain productivity levels with fewer people, through increased education or even possibly with the assistance of technologies like Artificial Intelligence and automation. In the end, people of working ages may also need to sacrifice in the form of higher taxes. But such a future will inevitably look different than the world we live in now, and Goodhart and Pradhan warn a lot will be riding on whether or not societies accept such changes. ""We doubt that politicians, facing rising health and pension costs, will be prepared or able to raise taxes enough to equilibrate the economy via fiscal policy,"" they wrote. Population 'cures' can be worse than population collapse While population decline comes with challenges, experts warn that attempts to reverse course are often at best ineffectual, and at worst hateful and destructive. After all, they note, the basis of population decline is personal freedom. Reiner Klingholz, a population researcher and author based in Germany, notes that smaller families and a more developed lifestyle often go hand-in-hand. As a society becomes wealthier and more educated, its fertility rate invariably falls. That's particularly tied to women's education and empowerment. When women become more educated, both professionally and on sexual reproduction, they are presented with life choices beyond homemaker and often choose to have less children, experts say. Development also brings increased wealth, which creates societies that are overall healthier and happier, even if the fertility rate is lower. “Look at Sweden and Denmark,” where fertility rates stand at 1.7, Klingholz said. “People are very happy in these countries.” Also troubling: Concerns about population decline often boost xenophobia. In the United States, ""Great Replacement Theory"" – an unfounded conspiracy that political leaders are intentionally replacing white Americans with non-white – immigrants has moved from extreme right-wing circles into mainstream discourse. More: Republican politicians all over the country have repeated the Great Replacement theory Perhaps nowhere is this tension more apparent globally than in Hungary, where the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban is now offering about $30,000 and a raft of subsidies on homes and cars for Hungarian families with at least four children, while opposing new immigration. “Instead of just numbers, we want Hungarian children. Migration for us is surrender,” Orban said in 2020. Such rhetoric stands in stark contrast to most economists, who according to Goodhart and Pradhan, value immigration as a tool to offset population decline and boost a country's workforce and productivity. Attempts to instead fix population decline through economic policies like tax incentives often fail due to the ties between women's empowerment and lower fertility rates, said Per Espen Stoknes, director of the BI Centre for Sustainability and Energy at the Norwegian Business School. “Men can't tell women how many children they should have,” Stoknes said. “It's not really about the issue of (resources). It's really about what kind of life do women want for themselves?” A happier future? Johnston says that in the end, population decline doesn't have to be a crisis. Ultimately, as with climate change, it comes down to wise resource allocation. If humanity can cooperate and efficiently distribute resources through immigration and economic policies, it could build a world with where people are fewer but more educated, and in which productivity and ingenuity still flourish. But that's a big ""if."" “It might be so much healthier if there's a smaller population overall, but much more cooperation,” Johnston said. “If China goes from 1.4 billion people to 800 million, but people go from peasants to middle class, how on Earth is that going to be a bad shift?” Kyle Bagenstose covers climate change, chemicals, water and other environmental topics for USA TODAY.

360,4-Oct-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla Stock Swings Sharply as Musk Goes Ahead With Twitter Deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2721019653/BFD812D457A14912PQ/106?accountid=13946,"Tesla shares made some sharp swings on Tuesday after news that Tesla CEO Elon Musk was moving forward with his previous plans to buy Twitter at his original price of $44 billion.
Tesla 's (ticker: TSLA) shares were trading steadily higher in the morning and reached $257.50 around 11:41 a.m., according to Dow Jones data. The news, hitting just after noon, sent the stock falling 6% intraday to $242.01. Tesla managed to close the day up 2.9%, to $249.44, after regaining its upward momentum in afternoon trading.
Twitter confirmed in a regulatory filing Tuesday afternoon that Musk's lawyers sent a letter proposing to go ahead with his deal to acquire Twitter at $54.20 a share.
Twitter's stock closed up 22.3%, but fell 1.3% in after-hours trading. The news came somewhat by surprise, considering the billionaire CEO has spent months trying to exit the deal, arguing that the number of spam and bot accounts and a whistleblower complaint allowed him to terminate his original agreement. Twitter sued Musk to get him to make good on the offer, which Twitter shareholders voted to approve last month.
Musk and Twitter were set to face off in Delaware Chancery Court at a trial scheduled to begin on Oct. 17.
Tesla shareholders worried that if Musk bought Twitter, he would be less focused on his management duties at Tesla, the world's market leader in electric vehicles. Tesla's shares are down about 25% from April 25, when Twitter accepted Musk's takeover offer after considering it for a few days.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Barron's in an email on Tuesday that Musk could sell another $2 billion to $3 billion in Tesla stock, ""but the worst is in the rear view mirror in terms of his sales for the Twitter deal. This has been a nightmare overhang that is the late stages of ending. The stock is showing some relief as this soap opera ends.""
Ives added he thinks the deal could be completed next week. Musk initially planned to partially finance the purchase with a margin loan tied to his Tesla stake, according to a filing , but he later committed additional equity instead. Musk sold about $20 billion worth of Tesla stock over six months through April. Then, in early August, he sold another $7 billion of Tesla stock in case he lost the case. He told his followers on the social media site he would buy Tesla shares if he didn't have to buy Twitter.
Musk tweeted in response to a question that he was selling the shares in August to have extra room in case the deal went through. ""In the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close *and* some equity partners don't come through, it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock.""
Tulane Law School professor Ann Lipton told Barron's in an email that the timing of Musk's decision to go through with the deal wasn't unusual. ""A lot of cases settle on the eve of trial,"" she wrote.

361,4-Oct-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Elon Musk Suggests Buying Twitter at His Original Price,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2720953245/BFD812D457A14912PQ/285?accountid=13946,"FILE -- Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, arriving at a federal courthouse in New York for a hearing on April 4, 2019. Musk proposed a deal with Twitter on Monday, Oct. 4, 2022 that could bring to an end the acrimonious legal fight between the billionaire and the social media company. (Jefferson Siegel/The New York Times)
The monthslong battle over Elon Musk’s bid to buy Twitter has been massive in scale and drama. One of the tech industry’s biggest deals in recent years, it has captured the public’s imagination, with cinematic twists that have been closely followed even by people who have never written a tweet.
Now Musk, in a surprise move, has added another plot turn. After months of trying to get out of a deal that he struck in April, the billionaire made a proposal Monday night that could bring the acrimonious legal fight to an end.
Musk said he would do exactly what he said he would do in April: Acquire Twitter at $54.20 per share, according to regulatory filings made public Tuesday.
Twitter, which sued Musk in July to force him to go through with the $44 billion deal, has yet to accept his new proposal and plans to add conditions to try to ensure that he doesn’t change his mind again.
In a short statement, Twitter said it had received Musk’s letter and reiterated the company’s intention to close the deal. Twitter may ask a court in Delaware, where it filed its suit, for protections that would force Musk to follow through with his new proposal, said three people familiar with the company’s plans, who were not authorized to speak publicly about them. The company could also demand that Musk pay interest on the deal price for the delays in completing the acquisition, one of those people added.
A deal would allow both sides to avoid a messy trial that was expected to start in two weeks in Delaware Chancery Court. The trial most likely would have featured testimony from Musk, who runs the electric automaker Tesla, and senior Twitter executives. Musk is scheduled to be deposed Thursday and Friday in Austin, Texas, according to a legal filing.

Twitter has barely been profitable for most of its history and is dwarfed in size by other social media platforms like Facebook and the much younger TikTok. But the fight with Musk has preoccupied Silicon Valley, Wall Street and Washington because Twitter has for years been an online bullhorn for opinionated tech industry billionaires like Musk and politicians such as former President Donald J. Trump, whom the company barred from its platform last year after the Jan. 6 riot on Capitol Hill.
If Musk does take over Twitter, one of his first big moves could be allowing Trump to return. Musk has said it was a “mistake” for Twitter to bar Trump.

The potential agreement follows months of disputes that have created existential challenges for Twitter, cratering its share price, demoralizing its employees and spooking the advertisers it relies on for revenue.
Musk, with his repeated, scathing criticism of Twitter and its management, has often seemed more interested in taking a wrecking ball to the company than becoming its new owner. His critics have argued that he has simply been looking for anything to justify backing out of a rash decision that he quickly came to regret.
“I think he recognized that litigation is not going well on his part,” said Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at Tulane Law School.
A deal at the original price would be a victory for Twitter. Musk declared in July that he no longer intended to continue with the acquisition because he believed Twitter’s service was overrun by spam. Twitter sued him soon after.
Musk submitted his latest proposal to Twitter on Monday evening, informing the company that he intended to proceed with his original offer. “We write to notify you that the Musk parties intend to proceed to closing of the transaction,” a lawyer for Musk wrote in the letter, according to a regulatory filing. The letter asked that the court battle be paused, pending the closing of the deal.
The two sides met in court in an emergency virtual hearing Tuesday to discuss the proposal before Kathaleen McCormick, the judge overseeing the trial. The proposal was reported earlier by Bloomberg.
Lawyers for Musk and Twitter were expected to meet again in court later Tuesday to discuss next steps, the person said. If they opt to proceed with the sale of Twitter, a deal could possibly close within weeks, or as soon as Musk hands over the $44 billion.
Twitter may request that Musk agree to have the court supervise the deal’s closing, said three people familiar with the matter. The company may also ask Musk to pay a daily interest fee for every day that has passed since shareholders approved the deal Sept. 13, one of those people said.
“Procedurally, Twitter has done everything they need to do to close this deal,” said Brian J.M. Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School. If the company accepts Musk’s proposal, it could request that the trial be postponed until the deal is completed, Quinn said. Once the acquisition is completed, Twitter will most likely dismiss its lawsuit against Musk.
On Tuesday evening, Musk tweeted that “buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” X is the name of the holding company that Musk formed to buy Twitter.
Shares in the social media company spiked more than 12% on the news of Musk’s latest offer, before a halt in trading. Trading resumed in the afternoon, and Twitter’s share price closed at $52, a 22% increase.
The economic backdrop has changed significantly since Musk announced his intent to buy Twitter last spring. Amid inflation and geopolitical uncertainty, investors are facing the kinds of losses they haven’t seen since 2009. That has also made it more difficult to finance deals.
Investment banks, led by Morgan Stanley, have already agreed to help finance the deal with about $13 billion in debt. The banks remain on the hook until April, according to the terms of their contract.
Musk has said he would finance the rest of the deal in cash. In April, he sold about $8.5 billion shares in Tesla to help fund the deal; in May, he said he had lined up about $7 billion in cash from an array of investors including the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and tech mogul Larry Ellison. It was not immediately clear what commitments those investors had to Musk.
In August, Musk sold an additional $7 billion worth of Tesla’s stock in “the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close and some equity partners don’t come through,” he wrote at the time.
Twitter employees learned of Musk’s proposal from media reports while participating in a companywide meeting about corporate plans for 2023 on Tuesday, reigniting confusion and speculation that have roiled Twitter’s workforce over the past six months, four employees said.
Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s CEO, did not immediately address Musk’s offer with employees, those people added. Sean Edgett, Twitter’s general counsel, said in an email to employees Tuesday afternoon, “I will continue to keep you posted on significant updates, but in the meantime, thank you for your patience as we work through this on the legal side.”

On the internal Slack messaging system Tuesday, employees discussed the implications for the company, their jobs and their stock compensation. In a channel with nearly 2,000 members that is used to joke about company news, some wondered what would happen if Twitter’s board did not accept Musk’s renewed offer. Some speculated that Twitter’s stock would plummet, while another, referring to Musk, said the company would not have to be owned by “a moron.”
While an agreement would signify an end to the uncertainty clouding Twitter’s immediate future, Musk’s plans for the company are not clear. He told investors before trying to back out of the deal that by 2025, he could get the company to 500 million daily users and revenue of $13.2 billion.
Twitter and Musk were set for a showdown this month in a Delaware courtroom. The company argued in legal filings that Musk’s reasons for abandoning the deal were smoke screens, and suggested that he had simply hoped for a lower price after stock market declines decreased his wealth.
Musk said Twitter had most likely undercounted the amount of spam on its platform, making the company less valuable than he initially believed. He also cited whistleblower claims from a former Twitter executive, who said the company had misled regulators about its security practices, as a reason to exit the deal.

362,4-Oct-22,USA Today (Online),Elon Musk says he wants to buy Twitter for $44 billion. Is the Twitter deal back on? What happens now?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2721036826/BFD812D457A14912PQ/466?accountid=13946,"The Twitter vs. Elon Musk saga may finally be drawing to a close. After months of legal wrangling, Musk offered to buy the company for the original bid of $44 billion, according to a letter from his lawyers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Twitter says it intends to sell the company for that amount but stopped short of saying it would drop its lawsuit against the billionaire Tesla CEO. “We received the letter from the Musk parties which they have filed with the SEC,” Twitter said Tuesday. “The intention of the Company is to close the transaction at $54.20 per share.”  Share surged 22% on the news. Now that Twitter accepted Musk’s offer to buy the company, what happens next?  Is Twitter a done deal? “The deal will solve some of the short-term uncertainty at the company, but Twitter is essentially in the same place it was in April,” Jasmine Enberg, an analyst with Insider Intelligence told Associated Press. “There is still plenty of uncertainty around what Musk intends to do with Twitter, as well as the future of a company with a leader who has wavered in his commitment to buying it,"" Enberg said. ""And if we’ve learned anything from this saga, it’s that Musk is unpredictable and that it isn’t over yet.” Twitter's advertising business and user base are much smaller than rivals Facebook and TikTok and it's barely been profitable. ""For Musk the irony is the easy part of this deal was buying Twitter, the hard part will be fixing it with monetization and subscriber engagement,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday night. Musk agrees to buy Twitter, again: Twitter shares halted after reports Elon Musk to move forward with $44 billion deal to buy the company Elon Musk is buying Twitter: Twitter accepts offer for $54.20 a share before court battle How soon could Musk be in charge of Twitter? While some logistical and legal hurdles remain, Musk could be in charge of Twitter in a matter of days – however long it takes him and his co-investors to line up the cash, said Ann Lipton, an associate law professor at Tulane University. The letter from Musk’s lawyers said he would close the deal if the Delaware Chancery Court “enter an immediate stay” of Twitter’s lawsuit against him and adjourn the trial scheduled to start on Oct. 17. “Some people are speculating that Twitter will ask the court to somehow supervise the merger to make sure that Elon Musk doesn't back out again,” Reed said.  Law professor: Musk's renewed interest in Twitter could be a win for free speech Musk deal would be a win for Twitter  A deal at the original price would be a win for Twitter, said Thomas Lys a professor emeritus at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.  In April, Musk said he was buying Twitter and then tried to call off the agreement, arguing the company had failed to provide him with information about fake or spam accounts.  The company sued Musk in July to force the completion of the acquisition. “The cost of this acquisition is now, given the market circumstances, way higher,” Lys said.  The deal would allow both sides to avoid a long and messy trial . As a condition of his offer, Musk asked the Delaware Chancery Court to “enter an immediate stay” of the case “and adjourn the trial and all other” related proceedings.  If Musk buys Twitter at the original price, theoretically, the lawsuit will be settled or dismissed, as Twitter brought the lawsuit to force the sale, said Jessica Silbey, professor at Boston University’s School of Law.  Legal experts and analysts say Musk was going to have a hard time convincing the court that something changed since the April merger agreement that would justify terminating the deal.  ""The soap opera now comes to an end with Musk owning Twitter at the original $44 billion price tag after this rollercoaster ride since April,"" Ives said. ""We continue to believe Musk saw the writing on the wall and knew his chances of a victory in Delaware were slim to none with the best path accepting the current deal and move forward."" Musk was scheduled to be deposed by Twitter attorneys on Thursday.  “He made an unsolicited bid, so he was stuck,” Lys said. “And whether he wants to buy it or not, he has no choice. Now he's currently just avoiding legal costs.”  'I just want Twitter to be maximum amazing': Elon Musk texts show Twitter friendship, feud Who is Elon Musk?: What to know about the Tesla CEO who appears poised to buy Twitter. Will Twitter help Musk build X? “Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app,” Musk tweeted Tuesday after his lawyers told Twitter he planned to go ahead with the takeover at the original price of $54.20 a share.  Musk was referring to his vision of creating an app that combines messaging, video, payments and commerce. In recent months, he hinted that Twitter could help build a “super app” like China’s WeChat that people use for, well, everything. “It’s a pretty grand vision,” Musk told shareholders at Tesla’s meeting in August. “Obviously, that could be started from scratch,” he said, “but I think Twitter would help accelerate that by three to five years. So it’s kind of like something I’ve thought would be quite useful for a long time. I know what to do. Don’t have to have Twitter for that but, like I said, it’s probably at least a three-year accelerant and I think it’s something that will be very useful to the world.” What a Musk takeover would mean for users Musk has laid out his broad plans for changes at Twitter, which would become a privately held company once the deal closes.  ""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,"" Musk tweeted in April. ""I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans.""  Musk, who has described himself as a “free speech absolutist,” has expressed concern over the way Twitter moderates its users and said the platform should be “politically neutral.” Critics have expressed concern that Musk would allow harmful or extremist speech on the site.  Musk has also vowed to clean up spam accounts on the site. Twitter under Elon Musk: What Twitter would look like if Tesla and SpaceX billionaire CEO was running it Will Musk bring Trump back?  If Musk buys Twitter, he’s likely to reverse a permanent ban against Donald Trump. Musk has indicated that he would allow Trump back on the social media platform where the former president had more than 88 million followers.  “Would be great to unwind permanent bans, except for spam accounts and those that explicitly advocate violence,” he texted Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal in April, according to recent court filings.  Musk also has a strong financial motive to bring back Trump, who is just the kind of mega-personality who drives engagement on the platform.  Trump lost his direct link to supporters when he was booted from the nation's top social media platforms – Facebook, Twitter and Google’s YouTube – after the Capitol siege. Of the platforms, Twitter was Trump’s favorite. Regaining that bullhorn would be a boon should Trump run for president again in 2024. Trump has continued to falsely claim the 2020 election was stolen.  Trump has said he would not return to Twitter even if invited. In an interview with Americano Media, Trump said in April he would not return because “Twitter’s become very boring.”  “They’ve gotten rid of a lot of good voices on Twitter, a lot of their conservative voices,” he said at the time.  But Trump has not gotten anywhere near the resonance he did on Twitter from his Truth Social app which has a much more limited reach, so some people close to him think Trump will change his mind. Facebook will decide in January whether to lift Trump’s suspension.  CEO Susan Wojcicki said last year that YouTube would lift the Trump ban “when we determine the risk of violence has decreased.” YouTube declined to comment.  The de-platforming of Trump sparked outrage among conservatives who said Facebook and other major social media platforms routinely censor their speech – a sentiment that Musk seems to share.  “Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it’s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law,” Musk said at the TED Conference in Vancouver in April.

As the death toll in Florida from Hurricane Ian climbed to 71 on Tuesday, many continued to question whether lives could have been saved if officials had moved more quickly to evacuate barrier islands and other areas devastated by the storm. In Lee County – which includes Fort Myers and where Ian made landfall at 3:05 p.m. Wednesday – officials waited until 7 a.m. last Tuesday to order people to leave vulnerable coastal areas, while other southwest counties ordered evacuations last Monday. Of the confirmed deaths, 45 were in Lee County. Republican U.S. Sen.

364,5-Oct-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Musk Reverts To Initial Deal To Buy Twitter: [National Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2721111396/BFD812D457A14912PQ/292?accountid=13946,"The billionaire's surprise move came months after he tried to back out of a $44 billion deal to acquire the company.The monthslong battle over Elon Musk's bid to buy Twitter has been massive in scale and drama. One of the tech industry's biggest deals in recent years, it has captured the public's imagination, with cinematic twists that have been closely followed even by people who have never written a tweet.Now Mr. Musk, in a surprise move, has added another plot turn. After months of trying to get out of a deal that he struck in April, the billionaire made a proposal on Monday night that could bring the acrimonious legal fight to an end.Mr. Musk said he would do exactly what he said he would do in April: Acquire Twitter at $54.20 per share, according to regulatory filings made public on Tuesday.Twitter, which sued Mr. Musk in July to force him to go through with the $44 billion deal, has yet to accept his new proposal and plans to add conditions to try to ensure that he doesn't change his mind again.In a short statement, Twitter said it had received Mr. Musk's letter and reiterated the company's intention to close the deal. Twitter may ask a court in Delaware, where it filed its suit, for protections that would force Mr. Musk to follow through with his new proposal, said three people familiar with the company's plans, who were not authorized to speak publicly about them. The company could also demand that Mr. Musk pay interest on the deal price for the delays in completing the acquisition, one of those people added.A deal would allow both sides to avoid a messy trial that was expected to start in two weeks in Delaware Chancery Court. The trial most likely would have featured testimony from Mr. Musk, who runs the electric automaker Tesla, and senior Twitter executives. Mr. Musk is scheduled to be deposed on Thursday and Friday in Austin, Texas, according to a legal filing.Twitter has barely been profitable for most of its history and is dwarfed in size by other social media platforms like Facebook and the much younger TikTok. But the fight with Mr. Musk has preoccupied Silicon Valley, Wall Street and Washington because Twitter has for years been an online bullhorn for opinionated tech industry billionaires like Mr. Musk and politicians like former President Donald J. Trump, whom the company barred from its platform last year after the Jan. 6 riot on Capitol Hill.If Mr. Musk does take over Twitter, one of his first big moves could be allowing Mr. Trump to return. Mr. Musk has said it was a ""mistake"" for Twitter to bar Mr. Trump.The potential agreement follows months of disputes that have created existential challenges for Twitter, cratering its share price, demoralizing its employees and spooking the advertisers it relies on for revenue.Mr. Musk, with his repeated, scathing criticism of Twitter and its management, has often seemed more interested in taking a wrecking ball to the company than becoming its new owner. His critics have argued that he has simply been looking for anything to justify backing out of a rash decision that he quickly came to regret.""I think he recognized that litigation is not going well on his part,"" said Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at Tulane Law School.A deal at the original price would be a victory for Twitter. Mr. Musk declared in July that he no longer intended to continue with the acquisition because he believed Twitter's service was overrun by spam. Twitter sued him soon after.Mr. Musk submitted his latest proposal to Twitter on Monday evening, informing the company that he intended to proceed with his original offer. ""We write to notify you that the Musk parties intend to proceed to closing of the transaction,"" a lawyer for Mr. Musk wrote in the letter, according to a regulatory filing. The letter asked that the court battle be paused, pending the closing of the deal.The two sides met in court in an emergency virtual hearing on Tuesday to discuss the proposal before Kathaleen McCormick, the judge overseeing the trial. The proposal was reported earlier by Bloomberg.Lawyers for Mr. Musk and Twitter were expected to meet again in court later on Tuesday to discuss next steps, the person said. If they opt to proceed with the sale of Twitter, a deal could possibly close within weeks, or as soon as Mr. Musk hands over the $44 billion.Twitter may request that Mr. Musk agree to have the court supervise the deal's closing, three people familiar with the matter said. The company may also ask Mr. Musk to pay a daily interest fee for every day that has passed since shareholders approved the deal on Sept. 13, one of those people said.""Procedurally, Twitter has done everything they need to do to close this deal,"" said Brian J.M. Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School. If the company accepts Mr. Musk's proposal, it could request that the trial be postponed until the deal is completed, Mr. Quinn said. Once the acquisition is completed, Twitter will most likely dismiss its lawsuit against Mr. Musk.On Tuesday evening, Mr. Musk tweeted that ""buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app."" X is the name of holding company that Mr. Musk formed to buy Twitter.Shares in the social media company spiked more than 12 percent on the news of Mr. Musk's latest offer, before a halt in trading. Trading resumed in the afternoon, and Twitter's share price closed at $52, a 22 percent increase.The economic backdrop has changed significantly since Mr. Musk announced his intent to buy Twitter last spring. Amid inflation and geopolitical uncertainty, investors are facing the kinds of losses they haven't seen since 2009. That has also made it more difficult to finance deals.Investment banks, led by Morgan Stanley, have already agreed to help finance the deal with about $13 billion in debt. The banks remain on the hook until April, according to the terms of their contract.Mr. Musk has said he would finance the rest of the deal in cash. In April, he sold about $8.5 billion shares in Tesla to help fund the deal; in May, he said he had lined up about $7 billion in cash from an array of investors including the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and the tech mogul Larry Ellison. It was not immediately clear what commitments those investors had to Mr. Musk.In August, Mr. Musk sold an additional $7 billion worth of Tesla's stock in ""the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close and some equity partners don't come through,"" he wrote at the time.Twitter employees learned of Mr. Musk's proposal from media reports while participating in a companywide meeting about corporate plans for 2023 on Tuesday, reigniting confusion and speculation that have roiled Twitter's work force over the past six months, four employees said.Parag Agrawal, Twitter's chief executive, did not immediately address Mr. Musk's offer with employees, those people added. Sean Edgett, Twitter's general counsel, said in an email to employees on Tuesday afternoon, ""I will continue to keep you posted on significant updates, but in the meantime, thank you for your patience as we work through this on the legal side.""On the internal Slack messaging system on Tuesday, employees discussed the implications for the company, their jobs and their stock compensation. In a channel with nearly 2,000 members that is used to joke about company news, some wondered what would happen if Twitter's board did not accept Mr. Musk's renewed offer. Some speculated that Twitter's stock would plummet, while another, referring to Mr. Musk, said the company would not have to be owned by ""a moron.""While an agreement would signify an end to the uncertainty clouding Twitter's immediate future, Mr. Musk's plans for the company are not clear. He told investors before trying to back out of the deal that by 2025, he could get the company to 500 million daily users and revenue of $13.2 billion.Twitter and Mr. Musk were set for a showdown this month in a Delaware courtroom. The company argued in legal filings that Mr. Musk's reasons for abandoning the deal were smoke screens, and suggested that he had simply hoped for a lower price after stock market declines decreased his wealth.Mr. Musk said Twitter had most likely undercounted the amount of spam on its platform, making the company less valuable than he initially believed. He also cited whistle-blower claims from a former Twitter executive, who said the company had misled regulators about its security practices, as a reason to exit the deal.Ryan Mac contributed reporting.Ryan Mac contributed reporting.PhotographElon Musk, center, has agreed to acquire Twitter at $54.20 per share, the same price he agreed to in April before getting cold feet.

365,5-Oct-22,The Washington Post,Elon Musk renews his bid to buy Twitter,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2721084274/BFD812D457A14912PQ/465?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has offered to proceed with a deal to buy Twitter at the price he proposed months ago before trying to call it off, according to a legal filing, a stunning development weeks before the two sides were due to face off in a trial.
In a letter that Musk's side sent to Twitter overnight, he offered to go ahead with the deal at $54.20 a share if the Delaware Chancery Court, which was scheduled to hold the trial on Oct. 17, agrees to ""enter an immediate stay"" of the case ""and adjourn the trial and all other"" related proceedings. Twitter enclosed a copy of the letter from Musk's attorneys in a financial filing Tuesday.
Twitter said in a statement Tuesday that it received the letter and intends to close the transaction at the original share price offered by Musk's team. The company plans to accept the offer but is waiting for confirmation that the judge can oversee the process, said a person familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive matters.
Because there is great distrust on both sides, Twitter leaders are still questioning whether the letter represents a legal maneuver, the person said.
Musk's offer comes at a key moment in the lead-up to the trial, which was due to settle months of legal wrangling between the billionaire and the social media company following Musk's moves in July to terminate his planned $44 billion purchase of Twitter.
Both sides had been conducting depositions. Musk's side collected testimony from Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal and whistleblower Peiter Zatko, the company's former head of security, who alleged extreme deficiencies in Twitter's security practices and inaccuracies in its filings to security regulators, according to court schedules.
Two people briefed on Zatko's sworn interviews said they did not produce any revelations that would have helped Musk's effort to escape the deal without incurring significant costs. Zatko was also deposed by Twitter.
Musk was scheduled to be deposed in the case Thursday in Austin, where he lives, after the original date was scrapped, the filings showed. His attorney Alex Spiro's deposition was expected to follow on Sunday in New York.
Musk and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday. The tech mogul weighed in on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon, however.
""Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app,"" he wrote. That letter is also used in his holding entities for the Twitter purchase, X Holdings.
Legal experts say Musk's willingness to close the deal suggests that he may have realized that he was in a weaker position than he wanted to be going into the trial and his deposition.
""Musk is finally listening to his lawyers,"" Anat Alon-Beck, a business law professor at Case Western Reserve University, said in an email. ""He would be a fool to not at least try to buy the company now and avoid being deposed.""
Bloomberg News first reported news of the offer. Twitter shares were suspended Tuesday at their highest level in months after the report.
""This is a clear sign that Musk recognized heading into Delaware Court that the chances of winning versus Twitter board was highly unlikely,"" Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, wrote in a note Tuesday. ""This $44 billion deal was going to be completed one way or another.""
The court held an emergency hearing Tuesday morning with both sides. Musk was willing to drop the case, but Twitter wanted assurances that the court would oversee the process because of the distrust, the person familiar with the discussions said.
For months, Musk has argued that he should be entitled to exit the deal because of representations Twitter had made regarding spam and bots on the platform, but legal experts said Musk had waived due diligence by proceeding with the deal.
Twitter has been thrust into internal chaos this year as it has faced a tumultuous stock decline and an increasingly uncertain future with Musk. Many senior executives and rank-and-file workers have left the company or have been fired.
The billionaire chief executive of Tesla took a large stake in Twitter earlier this year and launched a hostile takeover bid in April. The company was at first hesitant to accept his offer but eventually acquiesced.
While Musk's interest in owning Twitter initially seemed surprising, one motivation for his purchase was made clearer in text messages revealed in court documents last week: He was increasingly frustrated with what he saw as the encroachment on free speech by content moderation decisions. Musk said in a TED interview in April that he wanted an ""inclusive arena for free speech.""
He also said he would reverse the ban on former president Donald Trump, saying at an event in May that it ""was a morally bad decision, to be clear, and foolish in the extreme."" Twitter permanently banned Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.
The text messages also show that Twitter co-founder and former chief executive Jack Dorsey was one of Musk's biggest supporters in the process and was often at odds with the board, which was often scrambling to understand Musk and his motives. The texts reveal an elite cast of characters, including celebrities, high-profile investors and media barons, who gave Musk input on the deal, made hiring suggestions and sometimes encouraged him to let right-wing figures who were banned by Twitter back on the platform.
But the outspoken executive, who has more than 107 million followers on Twitter, moved to back out of the deal months later, arguing that he had a right to drop out of the agreement because Twitter hadn't given him enough information about the company's business.
Twitter and Musk have been locked in litigation ever since.
Musk soured on the deal amid economic pressures, as the impact of his offer caused a blow to Tesla's stock - the key source of his wealth - and his net worth. He had planned to finance the deal through a combination of loans and a $33 billion equity commitment tied to his own wealth, which would draw on investors.
Musk sold nearly $7 billion worth of Tesla stock in anticipation of having to close the deal in early August, after the battle was already going to court, surprising some investors.
""In the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close *and* some equity partners don't come through, it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock,"" he wrote on Twitter then.
The renewed offer was not immediately announced inside Twitter, several employees said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, leaving employees to learn about it the same way their users did: on Twitter.
But in an email to employees Tuesday afternoon, obtained by The Washington Post, Twitter General Counsel Sean Edgett informed them of Musk's offer, adding, ""Our intention is to close the transaction at $54.20 per share,"" echoing the language of Twitter's public statement.
Employees began to sound off on the platform Tuesday, expressing shock after months of deliberations. 
Some conveyed skepticism that the letter was sincere. One employee summed up the mood by saying ""Congrats or I'm sorry y'all"" in an internal Slack message described to The Post.
The prospect of Musk buying Twitter had already opened rifts among the company's ranks, as his critical tweets about the company and plans to reverse key policies, including its ban on Trump, rankled many employees. Meanwhile, the company's value slid amid economic woes and a decline in the social media advertising market, and in July Musk filed to back out of the deal, setting the stage for the court battle.
At least one employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss their job, said Tuesday that they can't imagine staying at the company if Musk becomes owner.
The possible resolution comes alongside a major downturn for internet stocks, prompting layoffs and hiring freezes at industry heavyweights. The possibility that Musk might yet end up acquiring Twitter at the original price has helped the company's shares hold much of their value during a year when social media rivals Meta and Snap have shed more than half of theirs.

366,5-Oct-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk's Twitter Reversal Revives Takeover Bid for a Now-Weaker Firm; Social-media platform faces advertising hurdles and fallout from billionaire's efforts to quit the deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2721350099/BFD812D457A14912PQ/518?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk's latest about-face over his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter Inc. has him poised to take over a company that is weaker than it was before he tried to abandon the agreement —thanks in part to his own actions.
Broad economic concerns have intensified since July 8, when Mr. Musk made public his intention to terminate the deal. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage point at a second and third straight meeting, the Dow Jones Industrial Average last week fell into what investors call a bear market, and Twitter's social-media rival Snap Inc. is slashing jobs.
While Twitter's stock price has held up because of Mr. Musk's potential acquisition , its performance has declined. The company reported a surprising decline in revenue in the second quarter that it blamed on weakness in the advertising industry and uncertainty related to Mr. Musk's acquisition.
Twitter this year is expected by analysts to report one of its slowest annual rates of sales growth ever as a public company, at 4.5%. In 2021, revenue rose 37%.
Mr. Musk has given few specific details about his plans for Twitter , but the billionaire chief executive of Tesla Inc. has said he wants to transform Twitter as a private company and unlock what he called its extraordinary potential as a platform for free speech.
He has talked about modifying Twitter's rules around content moderation, reducing its reliance on advertising—which provided more than 90% of its revenue in this year's second quarter—and making Twitter's algorithms open source, which would allow others to view and recommend changes. Mr. Musk also has proposed ""defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans.""
In texts released last week as part of the litigation between Twitter and Mr. Musk over his effort to abandon the deal, Mr. Musk said in April that his biggest concerns were Twitter's head count and expense growth. He also said he wanted to oversee software development at Twitter and works better with engineers than people with business degrees.
There are no guarantees that Mr. Musk will follow through with his proposal and close the transaction. Mr. Musk and Twitter are scheduled to go to trial Oct. 17 in Delaware over his effort to abandon the deal, and that could still go forward.
On Wednesday, the Delaware Chancery Court judge presiding over the legal battle said she is pressing ahead with preparing for the trial and issued a ruling that asked Mr. Musk's legal team to produce more of his text messages to the extent they haven't done so already.
Should a deal occur and avert a trial, the resolution could ease some of the uncertainty surrounding the company's future.
""Assuming the deal closes, it's a good price for shareholders,"" said Jason Goldman, former Twitter product chief and board member. ""But it's a bad outcome for everyone else,"" including employees who have labored under the uncertainty and users who rely on the product, he said. Mr. Goldman said he didn't think Mr. Musk has presented serious ideas about how he would lead such an influential platform.
Mr. Musk has proven doubters wrong before in becoming the world's wealthiest person. He has turned Tesla into the world's most valuable car company and a leader in electric vehicles, and his SpaceX company is the world's busiest rocket-launch operation .
Mr. Musk's legal team declined to comment Tuesday about his proposal. Twitter on Tuesday confirmed receipt of Mr. Musk's letter and said it intends to close the transaction at the original price of $54.20 a share.
The outlook for the social-media industry has darkened in recent weeks . Snap Inc. in August said it was slashing one-fifth of its workforce and curbing investment in a range of areas after a slowdown in its business. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. last week told employees it was implementing a hiring freeze and looking for other ways to cut costs.
In July, Twitter said in a regulatory filing that attrition was slightly higher than in normal economic times, but remained in line with current industry trends. Twitter said Tuesday that it had anticipated higher attrition this year even before the merger agreement.
In addition, Twitter's former head of security, Peiter Zatko, emerged in August with a whistleblower complaint listing a litany of criticisms about the company's management of security and privacy issues. That complaint prompted new scrutiny from Washington lawmakers. Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal told employees in a memo at the time that the spotlight on Twitter would ""only make our work harder."" Twitter also said that Mr. Zatko's claims were inaccurate.
Despite the industry's challenges, Twitter said in July that its audience has grown, reporting a second-quarter average of 237.8 million monetizable daily active users, up 17% from the same period a year earlier. Advertising revenue increased 2% in the second quarter compared with the year-earlier period.
Mr. Musk, when he met with Twitter employees in June, was asked about what he would consider successful for Twitter five to 10 years from now, and said a substantial increase in daily active users to over a billion, according to people familiar with the meeting. He also said during the meeting that Twitter should be entertaining, like TikTok, and that he admired the Chinese app WeChat, which is used heavily in China for a range of purposes including e-commerce and social networking.
Asked about his stance on free speech, Mr. Musk drew a distinction between freedom of speech and freedom of reach, according to attendees. He said that meant people should be allowed to say pretty outrageous things within the law but didn't necessarily deserve to have their tweets amplified and spread virally across Twitter.
In the texts released last week, Mr. Musk said in April, ""Twitter is obviously not going to be turned into some right wing nuthouse. Aiming to be as broadly inclusive as possible.""
Accomplishing that balance will be a challenge, content-moderation analysts said Tuesday.
""Elon Musk and his new leadership are about to get a crash course in the complexities of moderating harmful content,"" said Eddie Perez, a former Twitter employee who worked on civic integrity and misleading information and is a board member at the OSET Institute, a nonpartisan election-technology group.

 Elon Musk's Twitter Reversal Revives Takeover Bid for a Now-Weaker Firm

367,5-Oct-22,The New York Observer,Elon Musk Wants to Turn Twitter Into a “Super App” Modeled After China’s WeChat,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2721463229/BFD812D457A14912PQ/644?accountid=13946,"American tech billionaires are interested in creating a WeChat-like “super app” for Western users.

Elon Musk has finally made up his mind to buy Twitter, ending a months-long legal battle and media circus around the $44 billion merger deal. When Musk signed the acquisition agreement in April, he laid out ambitious goals to grow Twitter’s user base to 930 million (from current 217 million) and quintuple revenue to $26 billion by 2028. To that end, he plans to transform Twitter from just a microblogging site to an “everything app” that allows users to do many other things.
“Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app,” Musk tweeted on Oct. 4 after striking an agreement with Twitter’s board to go through with the deal. In another tweet the same day, he suggested building off of Twitter would be faster than creating a so-called everything app from scratch.
What is an “everything app”?
An everything app, or better known as a “super app,” is a mobile application that provides a wide variety of services, such as chat, social networking, payment, shopping and gaming, that effectively functions as an all-encompassing platform where users can fulfill most of their day-to-day needs.
The world’s most well-known super app is perhaps WeChat, operated by Chinese internet giant Tencent. The app had more than 1.2 billion monthly active users, predominantly in mainland China, as of September. Every day, hundreds of millions of WeChat users send messages, make video calls, share photos and documents, shop, send payments to each other, and even pay utility bills on the app. These activities are performed either through WeChat’s built-in features or “mini apps” that are embedded within the app.
Other notable super apps include China’s AliPay, Singapore-based Grab and Indonesia-based Gojek. While WeChat and AliPay are most popular in Chinese-speaking countries, Grab and Gojek mainly serve Southeast Asian nations.
Tech billionaires love the idea of a “super app” but regulators are unsure.
Musk floated the idea of creating a similar app to WeChat shortly after signing the deal to acquire Twitter.
At the All-In Summit 2022 in Miami in May, the Tesla CEO praised WeChat as “really an excellent app” and “a good model” for Twitter. He told an audience “we don’t have anything like that” and that “such an app would be really useful” in markets outside of China.
In his first meeting with Twitter employees in June, WeChat came up again. “You basically live on WeChat in China,” Musk told his future staff. “If we can recreate that with Twitter, we’ll be a great success.”
Musk isn’t the first tech billionaire to try to emulate WeChat. In March 2019, Mark Zuckerberg said in an interview he wants to shift Facebook users away from public sharing and more toward private conversations—a feature pioneered by WeChat in the early 2010s when it was first launched as a messaging app.
However, the super app model might be difficult to replicate in Western countries. In a study on the apps published in April, Insider Intelligence, a market research firm, attributed WeChat’s success to two factors: the takeoff of smartphone ownership in China in the early 2010s and a regulatory environment that allows WeChat to integrate thousands of “mini apps” under its umbrella. Neither condition exists in the U.S. or Europe, where smartphone adoption has peaked and strict antitrust laws may prohibit any company from becoming a one-stop-shop for all mobile apps."
368,5-Oct-22,Los Angeles Times,BUSINESS; Musk flips again on Twitter deal. Why? His about-face leaves many questions. What changed his mind? Can he still back out?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2721109613/BFD812D457A14912PQ/665?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk wants to buy Twitter for $54.20 a share: A headline from April, yes, but also breaking news, with the on-again, off-again Silicon Valley saga looping back around on itself to end up, on the eve of a courtroom showdown, exactly where it started.
With a trial over the stalled merger set to begin Oct. 17, the Tesla billionaire proposed Monday evening to consummate his courtship of the social media platform at the original price he agreed to pay in April.
A sharp downturn in the stock market quickly made the $44-billion purchase price seem high, and it wasn't long before Musk sought to back out, saying Twitter had too many bot accounts and was not transparent about the issue.

Although many Twitter employees were leery of Musk, who openly disparaged them as lazy activists, the company's management had little choice but to take him to court or risk the wrath of its own shareholders.
The latest development suggests Musk has come to agree with the many observers who saw a Twitter victory as all but assured. ""Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app,"" he tweeted Tuesday.
But what changed his mind? Could he still see a way out of the deal? And what happens next for Twitter, either way?
Here's what we still don't know.
--
Will the deal go through?
After the events of the last six months, it may be hard to take Musk's latest proposal at face value.
Musk initially purchased a stake in Twitter without the necessary public disclosures, then agreed to join its board of directors, only to walk away from that agreement to pursue the acquisition he would soon be trying to halt. He has publicly criticized Twitter's executives, suggested they misled him and investors about the platform's problem with bots, or automated accounts, and mused that the service may be dying.
Wary of another reversal, Twitter has reportedly asked the Delaware Court of Chancery to superintend the closing.
--
Could Musk still find a way out?
It's conceivable. A letter from Musk's lawyers declared his intent to close the deal as originally agreed to in April, ""pending receipt of the proceeds of the debt financing.""
That phrase could be significant. Musk's $44-billion offer included $13 billion of debt financing from banks, including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Barclays. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Musk could escape the deal by paying a $1-billion breakup fee if the bank financing falls through, said Ann Lipton, a law professor at Tulane University.
But there's a catch: That's only true as long as Musk is not determined to have sabotaged the financing or influenced the banks himself, Lipton said.
The banks could have their own motives for preferring to see the deal fail. They have struggled to offload buyout debt to investors in recent months and are facing huge potential losses from the Twitter deal, as well as many others.
On the other hand, the banks face both legal obligations and reputational pressure to follow through on their commitments, however expensive. If they bail, the chancery court could require Musk to hold them to their lending commitments, even if that involves Musk suing them to complete the financing, Lipton said.
The chances of a bank pullout ""are pretty slim but not impossible,"" said Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School.
--
Did bad publicity for Musk and his billionaire friends play a role?
It's a theory. The discovery phase of the case had already yielded a trove of internal emails and text messages between Musk and other Silicon Valley whales and even, for some reason, Joe Rogan.
Some of the texts have shown Musk appearing unprepared or uninformed. Offered an introduction to crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, Musk did not seem to know who he was. In talking to Twitter Chief Executive Parag Agrawal, he wrote, ""I kinda don't think I should be the boss of anyone.""
On the other side of the exchanges, Musk's friends came across in some cases as sycophantic, careless or both.
Oracle founder Larry Ellison and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen both offered giant sums of money to back the deal with no apparent intention of performing any due diligence. Angel investor Jason Calacanis offered himself up as a candidate for Twitter CEO -- ""Put me in the game coach!"" he texted -- and managed to annoy Musk by trying to raise outside funds for the deal without Musk's permission.
The messages also showed Musk's deepening ties to the political right. Joe Lonsdale, a conservative venture capitalist, texted Musk that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was in support of him.
Mathias Dopfner, CEO of media conglomerate Axel Springer, texted him: ""Why don't you buy Twitter? We run it for you."" Dopfner once asked executives at his company to pray for Trump's reelection.
Others reached out to simply celebrate the news.
""You are the hero Gotham needs -- hell F'ing yes!"" Riot Games founder Marc Merrill texted to Musk.
""Are you going to liberate Twitter from the censorship happy mob?"" Rogan texted him.
Musk was also due to be questioned under oath later this week.
--
What happens to Twitter now?
Although the messages released in discovery shed light on Musk's vision for Twitter as a free speech haven, his plans for the company are still unclear. In a meeting with employees in June, Musk said he wanted to reach 1 billion daily active users and make the company profitable.
To do this and pay down the debt he's taking on in this deal, Musk has a tough task ahead of him. In the June meeting, Musk implied layoffs were likely in order to bring down Twitter's costs, which currently exceed revenue. Some of his allies have suggested he lay off a large fraction of Twitter's 8,000 employees.
Whether in anticipation of those cuts or of Twitter becoming something they would find politically unpalatable, employees have already been leaving the company in droves, Business Insider reported in August.

369,6-Oct-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk's Revived Twitter Deal Could Saddle Banks With Big Losses; Volatility in high yield, loan markets might force Morgan Stanley, Barclays, others to sell $13 billion in Twitter debt at discount",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2721662063/BFD812D457A14912PQ/265?accountid=13946,"Banks that agreed to fund Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter Inc. are facing the possibility of big losses now that the billionaire has shifted course and indicated a willingness to follow through with the deal , in the latest sign of trouble for debt markets that are crucial for funding takeovers.
 The $44 billion deal , which Mr. Musk had been trying to walk away from, would be paid for in part with some $13 billion of debt seven banks including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and Barclays PLC agreed to provide when the takeover was sealed in April.
As is typical in leveraged buyouts, the banks planned to unload the debt rather than hold it on their books, but a decline in markets since April means that if they did so now they would be on the hook for losses that could run into the hundreds of millions, according to people familiar with the matter.
Banks are presently looking at an estimated $500 million in losses if they tried to unload all the debt to third-party investors, according to 9fin, a leveraged-finance analytics firm.
Representatives of Mr. Musk and Twitter continue to try to hash out terms of a settlement that would enable the stalled deal to proceed on its original terms, including whether it would be contingent on Mr. Musk receiving the necessary debt financing , as he is now requesting, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.
The debt package includes $6.5 billion in term loans, a $500 million revolving line of credit, $3 billion in secured bonds and $3 billion in unsecured bonds, according to public disclosures. To pay for the deal, Mr. Musk also needs to come up with roughly $34 billion in equity . To help with that, he received commitment letters in May for over $7 billion in financing from 19 investors including Oracle Corp. co-founder and Tesla Inc. then-board member Larry Ellison and venture firm Sequoia Capital Fund LP.
The Twitter debt would be the latest to hit the market while high-yield credit is effectively unavailable to many borrowers, as buyers of corporate debt are demanding better terms and bargain prices over concerns about an economic slowdown .
That has dealt a significant blow to a business that represents an important source of revenue for Wall Street banks and has already suffered more than $1 billion in collective losses this year.
The biggest chunk of that came last month, when banks including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG sold debt associated with the $16.5 billion leveraged buyout of Citrix Systems Inc. Banks collectively lost more than $500 million on the purchase, the Journal reported.
Banks had to buy around $6 billion of Citrix's debt themselves after it became clear that investors' interest in the total debt package was muted.
""The recent Citrix deal suggests the market would struggle to digest the billions of loans and bonds contemplated by the original Twitter financing plan,"" said Steven Hunter, chief executive at 9fin.
People familiar with Twitter's debt-financing package said the banks built ""flex"" into the deal, which can help them reduce their losses. It enables them to raise the interest rates on the debt, meaning the company would be on the hook for higher interest costs, to try to attract more investors to buy it.
However, that flex is usually capped, and if investors still aren't interested in the debt at higher interest rates, banks could eventually have to sell at a discount and absorb losses, or choose to hold the borrowings on their books.
The leveraged loans and bonds for Twitter are part of $46 billion of debt still waiting to be split up and sold by banks for buyout deals, according to Goldman data. That includes debt associated with deals including the roughly $16 billion purchase of Nielsen Holdings PLC, the $7 billion acquisition of automotive-products company Tenneco and the $8.6 billion takeover of media company Tegna Inc.
Private-equity firms rely on leveraged loans and high-yield bonds to help pay for their largest deals. Banks generally parcel out leveraged loans to institutional investors such as mutual funds and collateralized-loan-obligation managers.
When banks can't sell debt, that usually winds up costing them even if they choose not to sell at a loss. Holding loans and bonds can force them to add more regulatory capital to protect their balance sheets and limit the credit banks are willing to provide to others.
In past downturns, losses from leveraged finance have led to layoffs, and banks took years to rebuild their high-yield departments. Leveraged-loan and high-yield-bond volumes plummeted after the 2008 financial crisis as banks weren't willing to add on more risk.
Indeed, many of Wall Street's major banks are expected to trim the ranks of their leveraged-finance groups in the coming months, according to people familiar with the matter.
Still, experts say that banks look much better positioned to weather a downturn now, thanks to postcrisis regulations requiring more capital on balance sheets and better liquidity.
""Overall, the level of risk within the banking system now is just not the same as it was pre-financial crisis,"" said Greg Hertrich, head of U.S. depository strategy at Nomura.
Last year was a banner year for private-equity deal making, with some $146 billion of loans issued for buyouts—the most since 2007.
However, continued losses from deals like Citrix and potentially Twitter may continue to cool bank lending for M&A, as well as for companies that have low credit ratings in general.
""There's going to be a period of risk aversion as the industry thinks through what are acceptable terms for new deals,"" said Richard Ramsden, an analyst at Goldman covering the banking industry. ""Until there's clarity over that, there won't be many new debt commitments.""

 Elon Musk's Revived Twitter Deal Could Saddle Banks With Big Losses

370,6-Oct-22,The New York Observer,Investors Question Whether Elon Musk Can Juggle Twitter With His Many Other Companies,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2721989949/BFD812D457A14912PQ/280?accountid=13946,"Busy man Musk is spread too thin.
Elon Musk claims he regularly works 80 to 100 hours a week across at least four companies where he holds various leadership roles. The busy billionaire is about to add another big name to his business empire: Twitter. Suddenly owning a company with more than 7,000 employees will further stretch Musk’s already thinly spread attention and raises the inevitable question: How can he run so many companies at the same time?
Musk said on Oct. 4 he would go through with the $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, despite months of trying to back out from the deal. The news sent Twitter stock to jump more than 20 percent until exchanges halted trading to limit volatility. In contrast, Tesla investors were not so thrilled. The electric carmaker’s stock slid more than 4 percent on Oct. 4 and is down nearly 7 percent since the news, while the broader stock market rose.
The selloff might reflect investor worry that Musk will sell large chunks of Tesla shares to fund the Twitter purchase. (He has already unloaded about $8 billion of Tesla shares since signing the deal in April and will need to sell billions more under his latest financing plan.) It’s also “a classic example of diversification discount,” said Tammy Madsen, a management professor at Santa Clara University, meaning that “investors are skeptical about what business value the acquisition of Twitter will bring to Tesla.”
It’s not uncommon for an entrepreneur to own and run multiple companies, but it’s a management risk when a hands-on manager like Musk runs many companies in unrelated businesses and operating under different strategies.
Musk is CEO of at least three companies
Besides Tesla, Musk is also the CEO, chief technology officer and chief designer of SpaceX, a rocket and satellite manufacturer, and the CEO of The Boring Company, a tunneling company. In addition, he is the cofounder of Neuralink, a biotech startup developing a brain implant for humans. Neuralink’s latest SEC filing in August 2021 listed Musk as an executive officer and Jared Birchall, Musk’s personal money manager, as a director. All these three companies are privately held.
Musk is associated with at least eight other companies, according to the New York Times, including Wyoming Steel, a holding company through which he manages real estate.
Musk doesn’t have any experience running a social media company, yet he has big ideas for Twitter’s future. In a tweet on Oct. 5, he said buying Twitter is the start of creating an “everything app” like China’s WeChat that allows users to basically live on the platform. One of his first jobs once the merger completes could be looking for a new CEO, or taking the role himself, after expressing discontent with Twitter’s current CEO, Parag Agrawal.
“A big question with Musk’s Twitter acquisition is how much managerial hubris is involved,” said Madsen. Managerial hubris is a term describing an unrealistic belief held by a manager that they can run the firm they are acquiring better than its current leadership. “In mergers and acquisitions, sometimes there are many personal motivations involved that are not necessarily business related,” Madsen said. Falling Tesla stock could be a signal that investors think Musk has let his pride get in the way and overpaid for Twitter, she added."
371,6-Oct-22,USA TODAY,Twitter saga flits to next branch,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2721513629/BFD812D457A14912PQ/293?accountid=13946,"The Twitter vs. Elon Musk saga may finally be drawing to a close.
After months of legal wrangling, Musk offered to buy the company for the original bid of $44 billion, according to a letter from his lawyers filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Twitter says it intends to sell the company for that amount but stopped short of saying it would drop its lawsuit against the billionaire Tesla CEO.
""We received the letter from the Musk parties which they have filed with the SEC,"" Twitter said Tuesday. ""The intention of the Company is to close the transaction at $54.20 per share."" 
Share surged 22% on the news.
Now that Twitter accepted Musk's offer to buy the company, what happens next?
Is Twitter a done deal?
""The deal will solve some of the short-term uncertainty at the company, but Twitter is essentially in the same place it was in April,"" Jasmine Enberg, an analyst with Insider Intelligence told Associated Press.
""There is still plenty of uncertainty around what Musk intends to do with Twitter, as well as the future of a company with a leader who has wavered in his commitment to buying it,"" Enberg said. ""And if we've learned anything from this saga, it's that Musk is unpredictable and that it isn't over yet.""
Twitter's advertising business and user base are much smaller than rivals Facebook and TikTok and it's barely been profitable.
""For Musk the irony is the easy part of this deal was buying Twitter, the hard part will be fixing it with monetization and subscriber engagement,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday night.
How soon could Musk 
be in charge of Twitter?
While some logistical and legal hurdles remain, Musk could be in charge of Twitter in a matter of days – however long it takes him and his co-investors to line up the cash, said Ann Lipton, an associate law professor at Tulane University.
The letter from Musk's lawyers said he would close the deal if the Delaware Chancery Court ""enter an immediate stay"" of Twitter's lawsuit against him and adjourn the trial scheduled to start on Oct. 17.
 The timing also depends on what the court does, said Steve Reed, a law professor at Northwestern University. 
""Some people are speculating that Twitter will ask the court to somehow supervise the merger to make sure that Elon Musk doesn't back out again,"" Reed said. 
Musk deal would be
 a win for Twitter 
A deal at the original price would be a win for Twitter, said Thomas Lys a professor emeritus at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. 
In April, Musk said he was buying Twitter and then tried to call off the agreement, arguing the company had failed to provide him with information about fake or spam accounts. 
The company sued Musk in July to force the completion of the acquisition.
""The cost of this acquisition is now, given the market circumstances, way higher,"" Lys said. 
The deal would allow both sides to avoid a long and messy trial . As a condition of his offer, Musk asked the Delaware Chancery Court to ""enter an immediate stay"" of the case ""and adjourn the trial and all other"" related proceedings. 
If Musk buys Twitter at the original price, theoretically, the lawsuit will be settled or dismissed, as Twitter brought the lawsuit to force the sale, said Jessica Silbey, professor at Boston University's School of Law. 
Legal experts and analysts say Musk was going to have a hard time convincing the court that something changed since the April agreement to justify terminating the deal. 
""The soap opera now comes to an end with Musk owning Twitter at the original $44 billion price tag after this rollercoaster ride since April,"" Ives said. ""We continue to believe Musk saw the writing on the wall and knew his chances of a victory in Delaware were slim to none with the best path accepting the current deal and move forward.""
Musk was scheduled to be deposed by Twitter attorneys on Thursday. 
""He made an unsolicited bid, so he was stuck,"" Lys said. ""And whether he wants to buy it or not, he has no choice. Now he's currently just avoiding legal costs."" 
Will Twitter help Musk build X?
""Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app,"" Musk tweeted Tuesday after his lawyers told Twitter he planned to go ahead with the takeover at the original price of $54.20 a share. 
Musk was referring to his vision of creating an app that combines messaging, video, payments and commerce. In recent months, he hinted that Twitter could help build a ""super app"" like China's WeChat that people use for, well, everything.
""It's a pretty grand vision,"" Musk told shareholders at Tesla's meeting in August.
""Obviously, that could be started from scratch,"" he said, ""but I think Twitter would help accelerate that by three to five years.""
What a Musk takeover
 would mean for users
Musk has laid out his broad plans for changes at Twitter, which would become a privately held company once the deal closes. 
""Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated,"" Musk tweeted in April. ""I also want to make Twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features, making the algorithms open source to increase trust, defeating the spam bots, and authenticating all humans."" 
Musk, who has described himself as a ""free speech absolutist,"" has expressed concern over the way Twitter moderates its users and said the platform should be ""politically neutral."" Critics have expressed concern that Musk would allow harmful or extremist speech on the site. 
Musk has also vowed to clean up spam accounts on the site.

372,6-Oct-22,Barron's (Online),Judge Pushes Back Twitter Trial. Musk Has 22 Days to Close Deal.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2721537221/BFD812D457A14912PQ/504?accountid=13946,"A Delaware Chancery Court judge granted a stay in Elon Musk's legal battle with Twitter.
Chancellor Kathaleen St. J. McCormick wrote in a court filing Thursday that the Tesla (ticker: TSLA) CEO will have until 5 p.m. on Oct. 28 to close his acquisition of Twitter. A trial could still be held in November if Musk fails to do so.
The decision removed from the calendar an Oct. 17 trial date. Lawyers for Musk and Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday were at odds over what Musk's stated intention to close his $44 billion acquisition of the social media firm means for existing litigation.
The billionaire's lawyers had argued the social media firm ""will not take yes for an answer."" Twitter disagreed.
In a court filing on Thursday, the Tesla (TSLA) CEO's lawyers made the case to remove the Oct. 17 trial from the court's calendar. They noted debt financing parties are working to fund the deal's close, which is expected on or around Oct. 28. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Twitter and Musk's teams have been working to reach an agreement to proceed. Citing a person familiar with the matter, the Journal said both sides were racing to reach an arrangement by Monday.
Chancellor McCormick wrote that the decision will permit the parties to close the deal. Musk and Twitter had already delayed the billionaire's deposition that was scheduled for Thursday. The talks are focused on ensuring Musk's debt financing will remain in place, the newspaper added.
In their Thursday court filing, Musk's lawyers said counsel for the parties involved in debt financing have said their clients are prepared to honor their obligations related to a prior commitment letter.
Twitter argued in a court filing that the merger should have closed long ago.
""To justify that relief, they propose an order that allows them an indefinite time to close on the basis of a conditional withdrawal of their unlawful notices of termination coupled with an explicit reservation of all 'claims and defenses in the event a closing does not occur,'"" Twitter's lawyers wrote. ""Defendants' proposal is an invitation to further mischief and delay.""
The stock fell 3.7% to close at $49.39 on Thursday.
Musk surprised Twitter's lawyers earlier this week by sending a letter proposing to proceed at the price agreed in April of $54.20 a share. The company's value has held up far better than technology peers amid a broader market downturn as investors held out hope that Musk would end up paying up at that amount. The stock surged when Musk's letter was published Tuesday in which he seemed to abandon efforts to back out.
Musk hasn't made his plans for Twitter public, but has said it accelerates creating the "" everything app ,"" which might include mobile payments.

Twitter rebuffed the proposal, said the people, who requested anonymity because the talks were confidential.In the past week, however, discussions narrowed to a discount of about 10 percent, which would have allowed Mr. Musk to pay about $39.6 billion for Twitter. Those talks ultimately did not move forward. Twitter's market cap as of Wednesday was $39.2 billion.The talks took place just weeks before a scheduled showdown in a Delaware courtroom to determine whether Mr. Musk must follow through with the $44 billion Twitter takeover bid he launched in April. He indicated in July that he no longer wished to buy the social media company, citing what he said was an uncontrollable spam problem. Twitter sued him to force the deal through.The caustic legal battle exposed Mr. Musk's personal text messages with his orbit of tech investors and celebrities, ensnared top Twitter executives and drummed up uncertainty about the company's future.By reaching an agreement, the two sides could avoid a messy public trial that would most likely feature testimony from key Twitter employees and Mr. Musk. The billionaire was scheduled for a deposition on Thursday, but the parties agreed to postpone it, two people familiar with the matter said.But the discussions about a discount did not move beyond early stages, the people familiar with them said, and no term sheets were prepared. It was not clear why the talks had not gone forward.Mr. Musk sent a letter to Twitter on Monday night, offering to pay his full initial price for the company.Mr. Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX, said completing the acquisition was dependent on his ability to secure financing from the banks that had agreed to back his April bid, which offered $54.20 per share. If the banks do not follow through on their funding commitments, Mr. Musk will be required to pay a $1 billion breakup fee. He has also asked Twitter to halt its litigation against him.""The intention of the company is to close the transaction at $54.20 per share,"" Twitter said in a Tuesday statement responding to Mr. Musk's letter.Twitter is considering a range of options for adding certainty to the deal. They include court supervision of the closing process to ensure that Mr. Musk follows through on his commitment, and requesting that Mr. Musk pay an interest fee to compensate for the delays in the closing process, sources familiar with the talks said.Since Twitter received the letter, representatives for the billionaire and the social media company have been in talks. They had not reached an agreement as of Wednesday afternoon.""The parties have not filed a stipulation to stay this action, nor has any party moved for a stay,"" Kathaleen McCormick, the judge overseeing Twitter's lawsuit, wrote in a legal filing on Wednesday.

374,7-Oct-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla Won't Stop Falling Until Musk Stops Selling. Here's Where the Stock Is Headed.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2722360794/BFD812D457A14912PQ/134?accountid=13946,"Tesla stock had a terrible week, and it's likely to get worse before it gets better. There are a few reasons for that. One is technical, the other is CEO Elon Musk .
The week started out shakily. The stock fell 8.6% Monday after Tesla (ticker: TSLA) reported weaker-than-expected third-quarter deliveries the day before. The company delivered 343,830 vehicles , short of the roughly 360,000 that Wall Street expected.
That was the first problem. Then came Twitter (TWTR). Musk dramatically reversed course ahead of a legal deposition, saying he was willing to purchase the social-media platform at the original deal price of $54.20 a share.
For Tesla investors, having Musk add Twitter to his list of businesses raises the risk of management distraction. Musk has a lot to do at Tesla these days. There are two new plants which need to ramp production higher, and the company is on the cusp of launching another high-volume model, the Cybertruck , in 2023.
read this
The risk of distraction looks real. Musk himself has talked in the past about his "" chipmunk cheeks "" problem. He tends to bite off more than he can chew. That's a longer-term issue for investors to weigh. Investors have another, more immediate, Twitter-related concern: Musk's buyout likely means he will be selling more Tesla shares.
Musk already owns roughly 9% of Twitter stock and needs about $37.5 billion to pay for the rest. He has about $13 billion in debt coming in to help fund it and has sold a little more than $15 billion in Tesla stock already. Then there is another $7 billion coming from other people. That leaves about $2 billion in additional stock sales.
But wait, there's more. Future Fund Active ETF co-founder Gary Black estimates another $3 billion will be needed to pay holders of Twitter's stock-based compensation.
That's means Musk could need to sell a total of about $5 billion in Tesla stock. Musk can't sell any stock until Tesla reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 19. Bear Traps Report author Larry MacDonald believes investors will take advantage of that window and are ""front-running"" Musk, selling before he can.
As for where the shares can go, 22V Research's John Roque believes Tesla stock is forming a ""head-and-shoulders"" pattern. That's a technical term that indicates investors are becoming increasingly bearish.
The pattern starts with a stock move up and then down. That's the first shoulder. Then the stock goes to a new high, beyond the first shoulder's peak, and then declines again. That's the head. Then the stock goes to the high reached when the first shoulder formed. Once the stock starts declining from the second shoulder, it's likely it will reach the level where the whole pattern started.
For Tesla, that level is about $200 a share, according to Roque.
Tesla stock closed at $223.07 on Friday, down 6.3%, so Roque's level is down another 10% from here. The entire market was weak after a strong jobs report. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.8% and 3.8%, respectively.
Tesla stock has declined almost 16% for the week.
The stronger jobs number means the Federal Reserve will remain hawkish , raising interest rates to slow the economy and control inflation. That's something else for Tesla investors to worry about.

375,7-Oct-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Tesla Aims to Deliver First Semitrailer Trucks in December to PepsiCo; Elon Musk said the truck can travel 500 miles on a single charge,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2721896599/BFD812D457A14912PQ/173?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk said Tesla Inc. plans to deliver its first all-electric semitrailer truck to food and beverage maker PepsiCo Inc. in December, roughly five years after the billionaire revealed the vehicle.
Mr. Musk reiterated Thursday that the truck would be able to travel 500 miles on a single charge , as had been planned. The truck, introduced in 2017, initially was due out in 2019.
If Tesla meets its chief executive's latest stated timeline, the semitrailer truck would be the first new model the company is putting in customer hands since early 2020. Mr. Musk previously said Tesla didn't plan to bring any new models to market in 2022.
A PepsiCo spokeswoman confirmed Tesla's latest delivery timeline and said the trucks would support company plants in Sacramento and Modesto, Calif.
Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment, including about the number of trucks it plans to hand over to PepsiCo.
Mr. Musk's announcement came hours after a Delaware judge postponed a trial pitting the billionaire against Twitter Inc. until Oct. 28. Mr. Musk this week signaled a readiness to move forward with a deal for the social-media company, less than three months after trying to abandon his $44 billion deal to buy it.
Tesla's planned delivery of its semitrailer truck would come after President Biden in August signed into law legislation that created a new tax credit for commercial electric vehicles , among other incentives.
Mr. Musk touted the product early on with his characteristic enthusiasm, saying on Twitter in 2017, ""This will blow your mind clear out of your skull and into an alternate dimension."" He didn't, at the time, share the truck's sticker price.
In early 2021, Mr. Musk said Tesla didn't have enough battery cells for it to make sense to begin producing the semitrailer truck. The truck, he said, typically would use five times the number of battery cells as a car but wouldn't sell for five times as much.
The Tesla boss said in January that he hoped to bring the semitrailer truck into production in 2023, along with the company's long-awaited Cybertruck electric pickup and a revamped version of its Roadster sports car.
The vehicle introduction comes as Tesla also is pressing to meet full-year delivery targets as it tries to increase new plants in Austin, Texas, and outside Berlin as well as recover from a Covid-19-related factory shutdown in Shanghai earlier this year.
Tesla has been aiming to increase deliveries by an average 50% annually. To reach that target in 2022, the company would need to deliver nearly a half million vehicles in the final three months of the year, or about 44% more than the record number it handed over in the third quarter.

376,8-Oct-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition","EXCHANGE --- Business News: Musk Got More Time for Twitter, Not More Options",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2722637376/BFD812D457A14912PQ/450?accountid=13946,"A judge's decision to grant Elon Musk a delay in his legal battle with Twitter Inc. gave the billionaire more time to complete his acquisition of the social-media platform -- but no new leeway to avoid the deal if he changes his mind again, lawyers following the case said.
Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick on Thursday paused a trial scheduled to start on Oct. 17 and gave Mr. Musk until Oct. 28 to close his $44 billion takeover, following his about-face Monday after months of effort to get out of the deal. The judge said if a deal isn't closed by that date, she would reschedule the trial in November.
The judge offered no explanation for her decision. Twitter had objected to Mr. Musk's request, saying if the deal didn't close by Oct. 10, the trial slated to begin in Delaware Chancery Court should move forward to prevent ""further mischief and delay"" from Mr. Musk's camp.
While Chancellor McCormick previously rejected attempts by Mr. Musk to delay the trial, by allowing a pause she will continue to have discretion to enforce the merger agreement. Her order gives both sides time to secure the deal, reduces the risk of Mr. Musk successfully challenging a decision through an appeal and prevents wasted efforts of preparing for trial, according to lawyers following the case.
The ruling surprised some observers, appearing to introduce new uncertainty after Twitter and Mr. Musk had been in talks this week to close the deal within days. The Tesla Inc. chief executive notified Twitter on Monday that he wanted to return to the agreement on the original terms of the deal he had sealed in April, before saying in July that he wanted to cancel it.
Still, Mr. Musk's latest move has limited his options, legal observers say, because he now has represented to the judge that he intends to close the deal, and he will face pressure to get financing lined up ahead of the deadline. He could open himself up to securities fraud violations on top of shareholder lawsuits if he fails to move forward, according to Ann Lipton, a former corporate lawyer and law professor at Tulane University.
Chancellor McCormick can still enforce the agreement if the deal doesn't close by the deadline, even if Mr. Musk in the coming weeks claims financing has fallen apart, according to lawyers following the case. That, in some cases, can be a way a buyer uses to break out of a contract if debt financing isn't fully shored up.
If Mr. Musk plays games, the games are being played on the judge, not the company, and that is far more serious, said Zohar Goshen, a professor of transactional law at Columbia University Law School.
""He practically closed all exits,"" Mr. Goshen said.
Since the judge's order, Twitter and Mr. Musk's team have been in regular contact, discussing the mechanics of closing the deal, people familiar with the matter said, as is typical when two parties are preparing for a company to change hands.
After the judge's decision, Twitter said it looks forward to closing the transaction at the original price of $54.20 a share by Oct. 28.
To meet that deadline, Mr. Musk will need to gather the money to close the deal. He plans to use roughly $13 billion of debt from seven banks and is personally on the hook to contribute $33.5 billion of equity, though he has some investors who have agreed to help.
The debt, from banks including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and Barclays PLC, is unlikely to fall through, as the banks' commitments offer very few exceptions. That is despite the fact that they face the prospect of massive losses given the precarious state of the market to resell debt. Many are already preparing the funds and Mr. Musk's team has been in touch with them in recent days, according to people familiar with the matter.
One unknown is exactly how Mr. Musk will fund the rest. Mr. Musk, in public filings, has laid out funding sources that could be used in the deal for about $26.5 billion of the $33.5 billion he is on the hook for. Part of that was to come from other investors, including Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison, Sequoia Capital Fund LP and Saudi Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, who agreed in May to provide just over $7 billion in total. Mr. Musk is responsible for any shortfall if they don't follow through with their commitments.
Mr. Musk's existing stake in Twitter is worth roughly $4 billion, and he sold about $15.4 billion worth of Tesla stock in April and August. He said funds from the latter sale would be for use in a Twitter acquisition. To cover the remaining amount, he could rely on cash holdings or potentially sell more Tesla stock, though he has said after previous sales that he didn't intend to sell more.
Should he close the deal by Oct. 28, that would mean the litigation resulted in it closing roughly six weeks after it otherwise would have. Shareholders approved the deal Sept. 13.

377,9-Oct-22,The Washington Post,Musk would be running a company he doesn't want,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2722750054/BFD812D457A14912PQ/549?accountid=13946,"It's hard to know whom to root for in the Twitter-Elon Musk debacle. On the one hand, the Tesla chief executive agreed to buy the company and doesn't seem to have legal or moral ground to renege. On the other, it seems less than ideal to place an influential social media company in the hands of someone who doesn't want to run it.
To recap, for those who have not followed the twists and turns: In April, Musk announced that he had become Twitter's largest shareholder and was planning to buy the company for $44 billion, or $54.20 per share. The board initially did the things boards do to resist hostile takeovers; then, apparently, someone looked at the books and realized that $54.20 a share was more than the company was worth. Twitter agreed to sell itself … whereupon Musk almost immediately got cold feet, saying that Twitter had too many fake user accounts.
Twitter does have a lot of fake accounts, but of course Musk knew that before he signed. It's hard not to suspect that this sudden concern about bots was just cover for the real problem: $54.20 was already very generous in April, when Musk inked the deal, but in May the stock market started to swoon. By July, when Musk formally pulled out, Twitter stock was trading below $40, and the Tesla stock that he was using to secure financing had also lost about one-third of its value.
Twitter's board members knew a good thing when they saw it: Rather than renegotiate the price or let Musk pay a breakup fee to walk away, Twitter announced it was suing to make him buy the company, whether he wanted to or not. I'm not even sure what to call this. A hostile takeover is when a buyer goes after a company without management's consent. But finance seems to lack a punchy phrase for a hostile management forcing their company into the hands of an unwilling buyer.
There is a reason that finance never needed a term in its lexicon to describe this situation. Corporate managers don't rove the streets looking for hapless billionaires who can be hustled into court and made to buy their firms at unreasonable premiums. The billionaire has to make an offer first, and people who offer to buy companies generally, you know, want to own them. Thus it's far more usual to see an avid buyer and a recalcitrant board than the other way around.
Of course, nothing about Musk is usual. And so Twitter and Musk ended up in a high-stakes game of ""not it,"" with legal briefs and high-priced corporate lawyers substituting for the traditional finger laid along one side of the nose. Musk insisted he couldn't buy Twitter, because bots. Twitter insisted this was self-serving bafflegab and also that a judge should make this underhanded deadbeat buy and run their $44 billion baby.
Twitter seems to have by far the better of the legal argument; most observers expected Musk to lose when the case went to court, which was supposed to happen in mid-October. And if you embrace a very purist shareholder theory of capitalism (as this columnist tends to), then the board is doing exactly the right thing. Musk offered to pay Twitter shareholders too much for their stock, and it is the board's duty to ensure the company's owners reap that windfall.
That said, board members and managers tend to get somewhat attached to their companies. And it's hard to see good things happening to a company that's run by someone who would rather be doing something else.
Beyond that, from a social perspective, Twitter has a lot of influence, if not the profits to match, because journalists, politicians - and, oh yes, tech titans - tend to congregate there. It seems unfortunate to force the ""digital town square,"" as Musk has called it, into the hands of a somewhat cash-strapped billionaire who is already running a bunch of other companies and apparently doesn't want to be bothered with this one.
Courts, however, tend to take the legal perspective - which is why Musk was widely expected to lose. Perhaps realizing this, he has made yet another about-face; this past week he announced that, fine, if Twitter was going to be that way about it, he'd buy the stupid company. The judge in the case has given him until Oct. 28 to close the deal. (Will he actually go through with it? Umm ... probably? But three weeks is an eternity in Musk years.)
This has revived panic among the Twitterati about Musk's plans for the company, especially his rather laissez-faire ideas about content moderation. ""Progressive and government watchdog groups,"" Politico informs us, ""were quick to raise alarms about the threats a Musk-owned Twitter would pose to democracy and elections.""
I myself am not exactly looking forward to seeing former president Donald Trump back on Twitter, but I'm surprised that Twitter's obsessive users aren't spending much time talking about what this means for the future of Twitter as a going concern. In the annals of finance, there are a lot of stories of hostile takeovers gone wrong. But the risks of a hostile sale appear far higher - to democracy maybe, but definitely to the company itself.

378,10-Oct-22,Barron's (Online),The Fed Looks Set to Overshoot on Interest Rates. What to Learn From Earnings.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2723048254/BFD812D457A14912PQ/300?accountid=13946,"Last week saw markets raise their hopes of a Federal Reserve pivot to looser policy, only to have the dream dashed by a strong jobs report and string of policy makers saying interest rates must move higher.
Earnings season is kicking off now, and it's an opportunity to see what executives make of prospects of higher-for-longer rates. While we know that rate hikes can only bring down inflation with a lag, they can start to hit sentiment right away.
Advanced Micro Devices already warned that PC demand is weakening significantly. That will probably have some carry over for Microsoft and Apple, who report later in the month.
Consumers are certainly feeling the pinch of fast inflation and rising mortgage rates. This week will reveal how Pepsi and Walgreens are coping so far. If the super early start to holiday discounts is anything to go by—Target, Walmart and Amazon are launching special sales events this week—it looks like shoppers are planning to tighten their belts this year.
It's not just a U.S. phenomenon. The International Monetary Fund meets this week in person for the first time since 2019. Chief Kristalina Georgieva sees $4 trillion in missing output between now and 2026, a hole the size of Germany's economy.
But don't expect the Fed to be moved by any cries of anguish. Lisa Cook, the newest governor , said the Fed must stay the course until it sees inflation rates starting to come down in hard data, and that forecasts are particularly unreliable these days.
Fed officials are right that price gains remain stubborn. But by the time there's solid evidence of weaker inflation, forecasts for the economy might be much worse than they imagine.

Bank Earnings to Offer More Insight into Rates, Recession
Investors will get more insight into how the Federal Reserve's latest rate increases have affected corporate revenue and profit when big banks including JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup report quarterly results later this week. Investors will be listening to what the bankers say about credit quality.
* Rising rates run the risk of tipping the economy into a recession, which could mean bank customers will pull back on borrowing and some of them would struggle to make payments on existing debt. Investors remember the 2008-09 financial crisis and worry about another meltdown.
* Atlantic Equities found banks tend to perform badly in the early stages of a recession, as investors fret about balance sheets and the ""negative narrative"" surrounding a downturn. They outperform the market by an average of 30 percentage points in the early stages of a recovery.
* The U.S. stock market index fell 2.8% Friday after the latest jobs report showed the labor market remains strong, adding 263,000 jobs in September and potentially strengthening the case for the Fed to continue its aggressive interest rate hikes.
* The reports from JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Citi aren't expected to be stellar, but Baird analyst David George expects to see ""solid"" net interest income trends and slowing loan growth. Trading activity should be strong, offsetting any weakness in deal making.
What's Next: The Bureau of Labor Statistics will report the consumer price index for September on Thursday morning. Traders are betting that the Fed raises rates by another 0.75 percentage point at its November meeting, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.

IMF, World Bank to Meet Amid OPEC Cuts, Strong Dollar
As the International Monetary Fund and World Bank kick off their annual meetings in Washington today, administration officials and lawmakers criticized last week's steep oil production cuts announced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
* Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told the Financial Times the decision was inappropriate and harmful to the global economy, especially emerging markets. Yellen also played down concerns about the strength of the U.S. dollar and its effect on other currencies.
* Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) told CNN the U.S. should reassess its military alliance with Saudi Arabia, including American arms sales to the kingdom. But former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox the U.S. should maintain its ""deep important security relationship"" with the Saudis.
* IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva has warned recession risks are rising. The IMF plans to cut its global growth outlook for a fourth time since last October, and Georgieva said the world is at risk of losing $4 trillion in output by 2026.
* The IMF has approved a $1.3 billion loan for Ukraine, its first loan to the country since March amid Russia's ongoing war there. And the IMF has also approved an emergency finance ""food shock window"" to help economies that are being hurt by the rising price of agricultural products.
What's Next: The IMF and World Bank meetings are fully in-person this year for the first time since the pandemic's outbreak in 2020. The IMF will release its World Economic Outlook with its revised global growth figures on Tuesday.

BAE Systems Explores Reviving Howitzer Gun Production
British arms maker BAE Systems is in talks with the U.S. Army about restarting production of the M777 howitzer battlefield gun, The Wall Street Journal reported. Several countries have asked about buying more howitzers after seeing Ukrainian forces using them against Russian troops.
* The Army didn't comment, the Journal reported. Production is currently winding down, and Mark Signorelli, BAE's vice president of business development, told the Journal it would need at least 150 unit orders to restart profitably. The U.S. government has to approve foreign sales.
* Russia's Investigative Committee opened a criminal investigation into the attack on the Kerch Bridge from Crimea to Russia, and President Vladimir Putin called it a terrorist act by Ukrainian special services, the Associated Press reported.
* Russian authorities said a truck bomb caused seven railway cars to catch fire, partially collapsing two bridge sections, and killing three people. Russia bombarded Ukraine with a series of strikes on cities across the country, including the capital Kyiv early Monday, the Journal reported.
* Germany is investigating the sabotage of its digital train communications system that stopped passenger and cargo trains for nearly three hours across northwest Germany, the AP reported . Cables for handling railway traffic safety were deliberately severed at two sections, officials said.
What's Next: The U.S., the U.K. and Sweden have developed new, more precise GPS-guided shells for the howitzer. The 155 mm Excalibur shells, developed by BAE and Raytheon Technologies, can hit a target within less than 10 feet, the Journal reported.

Tesla China-Made Sales Hit Record in September
Tesla's China-made vehicle sales hit a record in September following an upgrade of the company's Shanghai plant earlier this year.
* The electric-vehicle maker delivered 83,135 vehicles from the plant last month, according to data from the China Car Passenger Association, reported by local news outlets . That's an 8% increase from August and beats the previous record of 77,938 deliveries in June.
* Tesla sold the second most China-made vehicles in September, behind BYD which delivered 200,973. Wholesale sales of new energy vehicles, which includes EVs and plug-in hybrids, rose 95% year-on-year to 660,000 units.
* Tesla made improvements to the factory, after a shutdown in July, ramping up production to around 20,000 cars a week from 16,000 previously.
* Globally, the company's third-quarter deliveries hit a record 343,830, Tesla reported last week. The number missed expectations, however, as Wall Street was looking for about 358,000, according to Bloomberg.
What's Next: Tesla stock has had a rough ride recently, falling 28% in the past three weeks. Elon Musk's impending purchase of Twitter hasn't helped with investors concerned the CEO may be distracted . The EV maker's third-quarter earnings on Oct.19 will be the next event to watch.

Musk Shouts Out to Kanye West on Return to Twitter
Elon Musk has a couple more weeks to close his deal to buy Twitter, but he's already shouting out to tweeters who have been absent for a while, namely Kanye West, who posted a photo of a hat with 2024 written on it. West has 31.3 million Twitter followers.
* The rapper, who now goes by the name Ye, returned to the platform after nearly two years on Saturday, to which Musk replied ""Welcome back to Twitter, my friend!"" West also posted a photo of him and Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg and said he was kicked off Instagram.
* A Meta spokeswoman told Barron's that content from West's account was deleted and restrictions placed on it after violations of the company's policies. CNN reported that West shared a now-deleted post with a screenshot of a text conversation that was criticized as ""anti-Jewish.""
* Musk, who said last week he would follow through on his $54.20 a share offer for Twitter after months of fighting to cancel the deal, has said he wants to create an ""everything app"" to rival TikTok and WeChat and prioritize free speech.
* Tesla's billionaire CEO has also said he would let former President Donald Trump back on. Twitter permanently suspended Trump's account after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on Capitol Hill. Trump had sent more than 26,000 tweets during his term in office and had 88.9 million followers.
What's Next: Meta, the parent of Facebook and Instagram, suspended Trump's accounts on their platforms in January 2021 and said it would review that decision in two years, meaning this January 2023, just as the next campaigns for president are set to begin.

 The Fed Looks Set to Overshoot on Interest Rates. What to Learn From Earnings.

379,13-Oct-22,Barron's (Online),A Musk-Owned Twitter Could Be a Tool for Global Mischief,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2724242264/BFD812D457A14912PQ/517?accountid=13946,"About the author: Paul M. Barrett is the deputy director and senior research scholar at the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University's Stern School of Business.
There was reason to worry about Elon Musk making Twitter a private plaything even before his recent games of long-distance footsie with Vladimir Putin and the Chinese Communist Party. Now, one can add the danger that the tech tycoon would use the platform to muck up U.S. foreign policy and provide cover for brutal dictators.
Musk is the world's richest person, based largely on his shares in Tesla, the pioneering electric vehicle manufacturer he founded. He agreed in April to acquire Twitter for $44 billion, backed out, and then changed his mind again . He says he now intends to close the deal. For months, the prospect of the mercurial mogul single-handedly controlling the influential micro-blogging site has prompted fears on the political left. Liberal critics warned that if Musk follows through on his criticism that Twitter has been too restrictive of speech that is legal but false and hateful, the platform under his leadership might welcome back the racists, antisemites, and other unsavory characters it has lately excluded.
Over the past several days, Musk has illustrated why his potential purchase of the social media platform could have geopolitical implications as well. A quick review of recent events:
* On Oct. 3, Musk tweeted a ""peace plan"" to resolve the war in Ukraine. His proposal closely resembled official Russian demands—namely, that Ukraine acquiesce in the illegal Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, rule out NATO membership to remain militarily ""neutral,"" and accept the outcome of a new U.N.-run referendum in four eastern Ukrainian regions that Russia has forcibly occupied and claimed as Russian territory. Ukrainian officials angrily rejected Musk's plan, while Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, praised it as ""very positive.""
* The episode became more ominous when Ian Bremmer, president of the consulting firm Eurasia Group and a frequently quoted expert on international affairs, subsequently said that Musk had told him that he had spoken personally with Putin before tweeting the pro-Russian peace plan. Musk denied Bremmer's account, but Bremmer stood by it, putting his reputation and that of his firm behind the accuracy of his claim.
* And there's more. After Musk tweeted his Ukraine plan, a commentator for the Chinese Communist Party's Global Times attacked Musk, saying that the tech executive ""believes too much in the U.S. and West's 'freedom of speech.' He will be taught a lesson."" In an interview with the Financial Times, Musk then endorsed China's top foreign policy goal: that independent and democratic Taiwan submit to Beijing's control. The Chinese government promptly changed its tune, praising Musk. Taiwan's premier, Su Tseng-chang, rejected the idea in a speech, pointing out that Tesla has a large factory in Shanghai and is banking on China as a major market for electric cars.
The first thing to note about Musk's recent media adventures is that he could be flirting with a violation of the Logan Act , which makes it a crime for a private citizen to engage in unauthorized negotiations with a U.S. foe. But even apart from that long-dormant law, Musk's egregious kibbitzing on behalf of authoritarians could become more troubling if he acquired Twitter. Some U.S. Republicans have opposed aid to support Ukraine, and early on in the war, former President Donald Trump praised Putin's strategic savvy. If a Musk-run platform reinstated Trump and some of his most extreme allies on the right, Twitter could become a more potent weapon for promoting Musk's—and Trump's—Kremlin-friendly ideas.
Another concern is whether the two leading sources of digital threats—Russia and China, in that order—would do more damage in the U.S. if Musk were at the helm of Twitter. He has said he's concerned about the prevalence on the platform of automated bot accounts, which sometimes are used by digital vandals, but given Musk's recently displayed sympathy for Moscow and Beijing, one has to wonder how vigilant the company would be about hack-and-leak forays aimed at prominent Twitter accounts.
Although popular with politicians, media figures, and celebrities, Twitter is the weakest , financially speaking, of the fraternity of major social media sites that also includes Meta's Facebook and Instagram, Google's YouTube, and ByteDance's TikTok. A Musk takeover would further weaken Twitter, as numerous employees who have tried to secure the site against hateful and false speech would likely leave; some already have . A sudden wave of departures, combined with Musk's anything-goes attitude, would make the platform even more vulnerable to manipulation, whether foreign or domestic.
That said, Twitter's potential as a tool for global mischief won't matter if any number of grim scenarios come to pass for its underlying business. If Musk did substantially loosen content rules and enforcement, Twitter would swiftly become a cesspool of pornography, harassment, bigotry, and misinformation. Users would flee, and advertisers—the main source of Twitter's revenue—would quit as well. In other words, the business would likely collapse as a money-making enterprise and either shrink vastly in influence or disappear altogether.
Musk has never laid out a coherent business plan for Twitter. His run at the company has always seemed more like a play for attention than profit. Some might mourn the platform's decline or extinction, but at least it would no longer be a soapbox for Elon Musk.

 A Musk-Owned Twitter Could Be a Tool for Global Mischief

In 1999, he was a cofounder of X.com, an online bank that eventually morphed into PayPal. That event set Musk on the road to becoming the richest man in the world.Musk still owns the domain X.com, which is effectively blank. I'll explain why in a second. He also owns the domain x.com/x, which conjures a page with the lower-case letter “y."" And “Y"" is the nickname of Musk's second child with the pop star whose name isn't actually Grimes, but that's what Claire Elise Boucher has chosen to call herself. Boucher briefly referred to herself as “c,"" the scientific symbol for the speed of light in a vacuum.We are dealing with extraordinarily exhibitionistic and eccentric people, to be sure.My non-ex-readers may remember my attempted explanation of the Grimes-Musk name games a couple of years ago, when they called their first child X AE A-12. That boy is now 2½ and known simply as “X."" He made a cameo appearance in a recent Financial Times interview with Musk: “He is cooing as he watches videos of rockets on his iPad while his dad discusses rockets with his team.""Dad's rockets are pretty amazing. Musk hopes to land a NASA mission on the moon in either 2025 or 2026, and he has been launching Starlink communications satellites to facilitate Internet use in war-torn Ukraine. Have you ever seen a double-tracked Starlink array in the night sky? It is a startling and discombobulating experience.I forgot to mention: Musk's space business is named SpaceX. As expected, Musk's successful line of Tesla automobiles has a Model X, exemplifying, perhaps, its exorbitant $120,000 price tag.X is of course our symbol for the unknown, borrowed from the Arabs who extrapolated the first principles of algebra in Baghdad more than a millennium ago. It hails from the Arabic word for “thing""; Musk could have simply named his children Thing One and Thing Two, but I'm off on an excursus here.X has imputed meanings as well. The X-Men have extra powers. The X Games feature extreme sports. X can connote mystery; consider “The X-Files"" or John Singer Sargent's sensual “Portrait of Madame X"" — “the best thing I have ever done,"" he remarked. The subject, a glamorous American expatriate named Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau had hoped to remain anonymous, but her plunging neckline was deemed too scandalous for 1884 Paris.Musk has grander plans for X, meaning the placeholder Internet site X.com. He has talked off and on about creating an all-encompassing web app modeled after China's successful WeChat, an omnibus application that allows users to text, telephone, surf the web, transfer money, video conference, play games, buy stuff, and more.X turns out to be the name of three holding companies (X Holdings I, II, and III) Musk created in Delaware as part of his ongoing bid to take over Twitter. It's assumed, incorrectly, I suspect, that Musk wants to seize hold of Twitter as some grand act of mischief, reversing the site's current ban on Donald Trump and like-minded miscreants. More probably he wants to use Twitter's tens of millions of US subscribers as a base to launch a US knockoff of WeChat.TwitterX? It might happen and you wouldn't even notice it. Musk is the master of misdirection, promoting himself as a “perfume salesman"" (Musk — do ya geddit?) while simultaneously dominating the electric vehicle market where companies such as General Motors and Ford are floundering to gain purchase.When Musk is involved, expect the unexpected.Alex Beam's column appears regularly in the Globe.

Lawyers for Twitter (ticker: TWTR) said they had demanded copies of ""substantive correspondence"" which Musk had exchanged with the authorities.
The filing was dated Oct. 6, but was unsealed in court on Thursday. Twitter has been looking to hold Musk, the chief executive of Tesla (TSLA), to his renewed commitment to close the deal at $54.20 a share, which he attempted to terminate earlier this year. Musk signaled his willingness last week to go ahead with the deal at the original price and the judge overseeing the dispute has paused pending legal proceedings between the parties until Oct. 28.
Twitter said in its filing that it had sought access to communications between Musk's legal team and the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission.
Musk lawyer Alex Spiro told Bloomberg that the letter was a ""misdirection by Twitter.""

 Elon Musk Is Being Investigated by U.S. Authorities Over Deal, Twitter Claims

382,15-Oct-22,Republican & Herald,Musk has a 'super app' plan for Twitter. It's super vague,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2725095810/BFD812D457A14912PQ/554?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has a penchant for the letter “X.” He calls his son with the singer Grimes, whose actual name is a collection of letters and symbols, “X.” He named the company he created to buy Twitter “X Holdings.” His rocket company is, naturally, SpaceX.
Now he also apparently intends to morph Twitter into an “everything app” he calls X.
For months, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has expressed interest in creating his own version of China’s WeChat — a “super app” that does video chats, messaging, streaming and payments — for the rest of the world. At least, that is, once he’s done buying Twitter after months of legal infighting over the $44 billion purchase agreement he signed in April.
There are just a few obstacles. First is that a Musk-owned Twitter wouldn’t be the only global company in pursuit of this goal, and in fact would probably be playing catch-up with its rivals. Next is the question of whether anyone really wants a Twitter-based everything app— or any other super app — to begin with.
Start with the competition and consumer demand. Facebook parent Meta has spent years trying to make its flagship platform a destination for everything online, adding payments, games, shopping and even dating features to its social network. So far, it’s had little success; nearly all of its revenue still comes from advertising.
Google, Snap, TikTok, Uber and others have also tried to jump on the super app bandwagon, expanding their offerings in an effort to become indispensable to people as they go about their day. None have set the world on fire so far, not least because people already have a number of apps at their disposal to handle shopping, communicating and payments.
“Old habits are hard to break, and people in the U.S. are used to using different apps for different activities,” said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence. Enberg also notes that super apps would likely suck up more personal data at a time when trust in social platforms has deteriorated significantly.
Musk kicked off the latest round of speculation on Oct. 4, the day he reversed his attempts to get out of the deal and announced that he wanted to acquire Twitter after all. “Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app,” he tweeted without further explanation.
But he’s provided at least a little more detail in the past. During Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting in August, Musk told the crowd at a factory near Austin, Texas, that he thinks he’s “got a good sense of where to point the engineering team with Twitter to make it radically better.”
And he’s dropped some strong hints that handling payments for goods and services would be a key part of the app. Musk said he has a “grander vision” for what X.com, an online bank he started early in his career that eventually became part of PayPal, could have been.
“Obviously that could be started from scratch, but I think Twitter would help accelerate that by three to five years,” Musk said in August. “So it’s kind of something that I thought would be quite useful for a long time. I know what to do.”

But it’s not clear that WeChat’s success in China means the same idea would translate for a U.S. or global audience. WeChat usage in almost universal in China, where most people never had a computer at home and skipped straight to going online by mobile phone.
Operated by tech giant Tencent Holding Ltd., the platform has made itself a one-stop shop for payments and other services and is starting to compete in entertainment. It is also a platform for health code apps the public is required to use prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
China has 1 billion internet users, and nearly all of them go online by mobile phone, according to the government-sanctioned China Internet Network Information Center. Only 33% use desktop computers at all — and mostly in addition to mobile phones. Tencent says WeChat had 1.3 billion users worldwide as of the end of June.
Tencent and its main Chinese competitor, e-commerce giant Alibaba Group, aim to make apps that offer so many services that users can’t easily switch to another app. They’re not the only ones.
WeChat has added video calls and other message features as well as shopping, entertainment and other features. Government agencies use it to send out health, traffic and other announcements. WeChat’s payment function, meanwhile, is so widely used that coffee shops, museums and some other businesses refuse cash and will take payment only through WeChat or the rival Ant app.
There is no comparable app in the U.S., despite tech companies’ efforts.
It’s worth remembering that Musk’s grand visions don’t always work out the way he appears to expect. Humans are nowhere near colonizing Mars and his promised fleet of robotaxis remains about as far from reality as the metaverse.
Twitter’s user base is also tiny relative to those at its social-platform competitors. While Facebook, Instagram and TikTok all passed the 1 billion mark long ago, Twitter has about 240 million daily users.
“Musk would not only have to overcome the hurdle of convincing consumers to change how they behave online, but also that Twitter is the place to do it,” Enberg said.

383,16-Oct-22,The Washington Post,Tesla's new Model Q: Join the conspiracy!,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2724919928/BFD812D457A14912PQ/197?accountid=13946,"That's it! I'm not buying a Tesla.
Okay, so I wasn't going to buy a Tesla anyway; they're too expensive. But now there's a principle behind my parsimony: I refuse to line the pockets of the world's wealthiest man as he destroys civilization.
Elon Musk, with his revived attempt to acquire Twitter, is trumpeting a return to the platform by the likes of Kanye West, a conspiracy-crazed antisemite. Under Musk, Twitter would quickly become a cesspool of conspiracy mongers and white supremacists.
That's unwelcome news to wealthy progressives - the vilified urban ""elite"" - who buy Musk's electric cars. There's some evidence that his MAGA conversion (not to mention his social media outbursts, pro-Putin tendencies and personal erraticism) is turning off would-be Tesla owners. This calls for a great replacement of customers!
So where will Musk find those new Tesla buyers? Well, consider the consumers most delighted by his determination to turn Twitter into a haven for disinformation, white nationalism and Russian sympathizers: the 1 in 5 Americans who embrace QAnon, the antisemitic, sometimes violent and always ludicrous and debunked extremist ideology that a satanic cabal of pedophiles runs the government. The QAnon crowd, and related groups such as the Proud Boys, have been a vast untapped market in the automotive sector - until now.

384,20-Oct-22,The New York Observer,"Elon Musk Boasts Tesla One Day Could be Worth $4.4 Trillion, Despite its Lackluster Quarterly Earnings",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2726601201/BFD812D457A14912PQ/46?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk sets new target for Tesla valuation.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the electric carmaker could grow to be the world’s most valuable company.
“I see a potential path with Tesla worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined,” Musk said during a call with investors on Oct. 19 following Tesla’s third-quarter earnings release. Apple and Saudi Aramco are currently the world’s two most valuable companies, worth $2.3 trillion and $2.1 trillion respectively. Per Musk’s claim, Tesla could be worth more than $4.4 trillion one day, nearly seven times its current market cap.
Musk clarified it won’t be an easy target. “In fact, I think it will be very difficult,” he said. “It will require a lot of work, some very creative new products, manage expansion, and always luck.”
Tesla has been investing heavily to grow its product lineup in recent years, but electric cars still make up the vast majority of the company’s sales. New products under development include a battery pack, a robotaxi platform and an electric pickup truck called Cybertruck, which Musk said is “in the final lap” of development.
Musk’s lofty claim about Tesla’s potential valuation did little to boost the company’s stock price. Tesla shares fell more than 8 percent in morning trading today (Oct. 20) after its reported revenue missed analyst expectations."
385,20-Oct-22,Barron's (Online),"Tesla Bigger Than Apple and Saudi Aramco Combined? Dream On, Investors Tell Musk.",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2726338459/BFD812D457A14912PQ/51?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk says Tesla can eclipse the combined value of Apple and Saudi Aramco, the world's most valuable companies. The market thinks that's ludicrous.
For context, the two companies' combined market cap stands at around $4.4 trillion , as of Wednesday, while Tesla's sits just below $700 billion.
The billionaire said he saw a path to achieving that but added it would be a very difficult one , but one he saw nonetheless.
The market doesn't share Musk's confidence. Tesla stock has fallen 37% so far this year and the shares look set for more losses Thursday after the company's third-quarter earnings.
In fairness, in 2017 Musk predicted Tesla could be worth as much as Apple, and it did eventually surpass the tech giant's valuation at the time the call was made.
But the electric-vehicle maker's earnings highlight that the situation is very different right now. Revenue and deliveries both missed expectations in the quarter. Musk explained that transportation problems toward the end of the period were a factor and that demand remained ""excellent."" However, he flagged the impact of a ""recession of sorts"" in Europe and China.
That, along with Musk's endeavors to buy Twitter, has all painted a fairly gloomy picture for investors. In fact, there's been little optimism at all this year when it comes to Tesla or corporate America in general.
The S&P 500 has ended in the green on 43.5% of the trading days so far in 2022, which is the lowest since 1974, according to LPL Financial data.
The market is looking to the future this earnings season, and it doesn't like what's coming down the line.

Tesla Beats Expectations, but Investors Wanted More
Tesla reported slightly better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and record operating profit, and it reiterated its guidance for 50% volume growth. But its stock still fell 5% after-hours because its bottom-line numbers weren't enough to quell investor questions about the company and the industry.
* Tesla reported earnings of $1.05 a share on $21.5 billion in sales, which were a tad lower than expected. Record $3.69 billion operating profit beat the previous record of $3.6 billion in the first quarter, but analysts were projecting $3.9 billion.
* Automotive gross profit margins, excluding benefits from selling zero emission credits, came in at 26.7%, up from 26.2% in the second quarter of 2022. Gross profit per car delivered came in at about $15,200, down from more than $16,000 in the second quarter of 2022.
* Amid rising interest rates and recession fears, Wall Street has become more pessimistic about Tesla's ability to deliver the 1.4 million vehicles it needs, including nearly 500,000 EVs in the final quarter, to hit its 2022 target of boosting output by 50%, The Wall Street Journal reported .
* Tesla's CEO and largest shareholder Elon Musk has sold more than $15 billion of Tesla stock this year, with at least some of the proceeds going to finance his $44 billion purchase of Twitter. Some investors worry he may need to sell more, but Musk says he won't.
What's Next: Tesla plans to deliver its first electric semitrailer trucks in December, three years later than initially planned, to PepsiCo. The truck, produced in Nevada, would be Tesla's first new model since it rolled out the Model Y compact sport-utility vehicle in early 2020, the Journal reported.

Biden Plan to Draw Down Oil Reserves Sets Price Floor
President Joe Biden's plan to lower gasoline prices involves another drawdown of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but adds an incentive to producers to raise output by offering to buy oil to refill the reserve at $67 to $72 a barrel, essentially putting a floor on the price.
* The SPR will have about 400 million barrels remaining after the latest 15 million barrels are released in December, administration officials said. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, traded around $87.24 a barrel on Thursday.
* Richard Joswick, the head of global oil analytics at S & P Global Commodity Insights, said the buyback plan supports a floor under oil futures for 2024 to 2025, noting that WTI for December 2024 is currently around $70 a barrel.
* Biden wants to assure producers that their investments in production now won't go to waste later if oil prices fall. Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said the strategy is ""a smart one,"" keeping a cap on oil prices while encouraging oil giants to raise production.
* U.S. oil production is around 12 million barrels a day, Biden said, denying his administration had slowed output. By the end of the year, domestic oil production will be up by one million barrels a day compared with early 2021, and on its way to a new peak in 2023.
What's Next: Exxon Mobil and Chevron hold their earnings conference calls on Oct. 28. Moya from Oanda noted that it's a chance for them to detail capital spending plans and hear whether they will abide by the White House and deliver more output over the next year despite recessionary fears.

Philip Morris Lifts Offer for Smoke-Free Tobacco Maker Swedish Match
Philip Morris International raised its offer to acquire Swedish Match, the European maker of smoke-free tobacco products, and reached a deal with Altria to buy the U.S. rights to IQOS heated tobacco products.
* The company lifted its bid for Swedish Match to 116 kronor a share ($10.34) from 106 kronor. The increase values the target at nearly $15.8 billion. Philip Morris said it wouldn't be raising the offer again.
* Swedish Match makes nicotine pouches and Swedish-style tobacco snuff known as snus. Philip Morris first offered to buy it in May.
* IQOS is a heated tobacco device. Under the deal with Altria, it will pay $2.7 billion to regain the commercialization rights for the products.
What's Next: The deal for Swedish Match is an example of how the stronger dollar can affect mergers and acquisitions. The offer from Philip Morris was raised significantly in kronor but stayed very similar in dollar terms.

Abbott Raises Outlook Despite Waning Covid Test Sales
Abbott Laboratories said third quarter sales took a hit from declining Covid-19 testing and a nationwide baby formula shortage, but it still beat expectations and raised its full-year earnings outlook for the second time. Abbott's shares fell 6.5% Wednesday, and are down 30% this year.
* With fewer people getting tested for Covid, sales of its rapid tests declined to $1.7 billion, far from the Omicron-fueled peak of $3.3 billion in the first quarter of 2021. In addition, Abbott paused activity at a Michigan factory and issued a voluntary recall of powdered infant formulas earlier this year.
* CEO Robert Ford said Abbott was pleased with improving sales growth rates in medical devices, up 11.3% to $1.7 billion from last year, fueled by several recent product launches. Abbott is focusing on products such as its FreeStyle Libre glucose monitors.
* Separately, Novavax's protein-based Covid booster was authorized for adults at least six months after their primary vaccine series, for people who don't want or can't get the latest booster shots from Pfizer or Moderna. A committee of the European Medicines Agency separately recommended authorizing Moderna's latest booster.
* An advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that Covid shots become part of the agency's vaccine program for children, which provides many different types of free vaccines to millions of young people a year.
What's Next: Abbott expects to sell $500 million in Covid tests in the final quarter, for $7.8 billion total sales in 2022. It raised its adjusted earnings guidance for the full year for a second time, to $5.17 to $5.23 a share, up from prior guidance of at least $4.90.

United's CEO 'So Optimistic' About Future of Air Travel
Airline stocks rose Wednesday after United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby cited numerous reasons why he is "" so optimistic about 2023"" and the future of air travel. Not only did United's third quarter results beat expectations, but revenue per seat mile soared 25.5% from the same quarter in 2019.
* Although aviation is still recovering from the pandemic, with plenty of room for growth, hybrid work is enabling people to fly more frequently, Kirby said. Pilot shortages, fewer aircraft deliveries from Boeing and Airbus, and airport infrastructure constraints will limit airline industry capacity for years.
* United said fourth-quarter capacity would be about 10% lower than what it was in 2019, which would be similar to its third quarter, when capacity was down 9.8% from 2019 levels.
* The airline also expects to hire 15,000 workers next year, matching its 15,000 hires this year, including airport personnel, flight attendants, pilots, and technicians.
* Cowen analyst Helane Becker expects travel will pick up well into 2024. ""There are three years worth of travel and bucket list trips for people to take, and they appear to be willing to travel in spite of various economic and geopolitical issues,"" Becker wrote.
What's Next: Spirit Airlines shareholders approved its merger with JetBlue Airways in a $3.8 billion deal, moving closer to creating the nation's fifth-largest airline. They expect the regulatory process will end and the deal will close later than the first half of 2024.

From prepaying college bills to making charitable donations, what are simple ways to lower your tax bill that may be too easily overlooked?
With year-end rapidly approaching, it's time to consider moves that will lower your 2022 tax bill and hopefully position you for tax savings in future years too.
While the fates of the economy and the stock market remain uncertain, it now appears that there won't be any significant tax increases this year or next year. Assuming that turns out to be true, the year-end tax planning environment is much better than it was at this time last year.

 Tesla Bigger Than Apple and Saudi Aramco Combined? Dream On, Investors Tell Musk.

386,20-Oct-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Tesla Cuts 2022 Vehicle-Delivery Target, but CEO Musk Says Demand Remains Strong; Electric-vehicle maker reports near-record profit as its sales miss Wall Street's expectations",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2726045601/BFD812D457A14912PQ/162?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc. cut its full-year growth expectations as it adjusts vehicle-shipping patterns, but Chief Executive Elon Musk brushed off worries about weakening demand amid recession fears.
The company expects to ""sell every car that we make for as far into the future as we can see,"" Mr. Musk said as Tesla reported near-record quarterly profit.
Strong vehicle pricing helped Tesla generate nearly $3.3 billion in quarterly profit for the three months ended in September, ahead of expectations of analysts surveyed by FactSet. That is just shy of the company's record quarterly profit of more than $3.3 billion, set in the first quarter.
Tesla, after the market's close on Wednesday, posted quarterly revenue of $21.5 billion, its highest ever , up from around $13.8 billion in last year's third quarter and short of Wall Street expectations. The company said its results were affected by the strong dollar, higher raw materials and logistics costs, and inefficiencies associated with getting car plants in Texas and Germany up to speed.
Tesla expects to finish the year just shy of its 2022 target of boosting vehicle deliveries by 50%, Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn said. He attributed the lower growth to changes in how the company produces and distributes cars to customers. Tesla delivered roughly 936,000 vehicles in 2021 and would need to hand over more than 1.4 million this year to achieve the original target.
Mr. Musk characterized Tesla as ""recession-resilient,"" saying, ""We are going pedal to the metal come rain or shine. So we are not reducing our production in any meaningful way, recession or not recession.""
 Tesla's stock price has fallen by around 37% in 2022 through Wednesday, eclipsing the roughly 32% decline in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, as the company has navigated production hiccups and ongoing supply-chain challenges. Mr. Musk's on-again, off-again pursuit of Twitter Inc. also has weighed on the car maker's stock. Shares were down more than 5% in off-hours trading.
Mr. Musk, Tesla's largest shareholder, has sold more than $15 billion of Tesla stock this year, indicating that at least some of the proceeds would be used to finance his $44 billion deal for Twitter . Some investors have worried that he may need to sell more to close the transaction. Mr. Musk has said after recent sales that he didn't intend to sell more Tesla stock.
Mr. Musk said Wednesday that he is excited about ""the Twitter situation,"" even as he said he and other investors would be overpaying for the social-media company right now. ""The long-term potential for Twitter in my view is an order of magnitude greater than its current value,"" he said.
The billionaire entrepreneur said the company's board has been kicking around the idea of repurchasing shares of Tesla stock and that it is likely the company will pursue a ""meaningful buyback."" He floated the idea of a buyback of around $5 billion to $10 billion in 2023.
In a move seemingly aimed at appealing to investors, Mr. Musk described a future in which Tesla would overtake Apple Inc. as America's largest company and enjoy a market valuation larger than Apple and oil giant Saudi Aramco , officially named Saudi Arabian Oil Co., combined.
Tesla has repeatedly raised prices for its vehicles as parts have become more expensive and new cars difficult to come by because of supply-chain bottlenecks. Tesla cars sold for an average of around $57,000 in the third quarter, up from about $49,000 a year earlier, analysts surveyed by FactSet estimated, lifting the company's bottom line and mitigating the lower-than-expected deliveries in the third quarter.
Analysis From Heard on the Street
Tesla said changes to its production and distribution practices that are expected to help reduce vehicle costs led to more cars being in transit at the end of the quarter.
Still, the deliveries result, paired with declining wait times for new vehicles and global economic turmoil, has sparked concern about whether demand for Teslas may be weakening.
""We could be seeing the early signs of a demand issue but monthly registrations and 4Q results will need to be monitored to better assess the situation,"" Cowen analysts wrote in a recent note to investors, expressing concern in particular about consumer appetite in China.
Customers in China ordering a new Model 3 in September could expect to wait about four or five weeks to receive their car, down from around 18 weeks in July, according to Bernstein Research.
Wait times also have declined for Tesla's most popular models in the U.S., where the average interest rate on a new-car loan reached 5.7% in the third quarter, up from 4.3% a year earlier, according to Edmunds.com. Higher rates make it more expensive to finance a car purchase.
Mr. Musk said in July he hoped Tesla would be able to lower vehicle prices, which he said were at ""embarrassing levels."" ""You cannot just raise prices to some arbitrarily high level, because you pass the affordability boundary and then demand falls off a cliff,"" he said.
Tesla plans to deliver its first electric semitrailer trucks in December, three years later than initially planned, to food and beverage maker PepsiCo Inc. If the company meets its latest timeline, the truck, produced in Nevada, would be the first new model Tesla is putting in customer hands since it rolled out the Model Y compact sport-utility vehicle in early 2020. Mr. Musk said Tesla aims to produce 50,000 large trucks in 2024.
President Biden in August signed into law legislation creating a new tax credit of up to $40,000 for commercial electric vehicles, available beginning in 2023. That law also opens the door for Tesla's passenger vehicles to once again qualify for a $7,500 consumer tax break, also beginning next year. Teslas qualified early on for such a credit, before the company hit a sales cap.
Tesla reiterated plans for the long-awaited Cybertruck pickup to enter production next year. Mr. Musk also said that he expects, by the end of the year, to broaden access to the enhanced version of the company's advanced driver-assistance system that helps drivers navigate through cities. That system, dubbed Full Self-Driving, costs $15,000 and doesn't make Tesla vehicles autonomous.

 Tesla Cuts 2022 Vehicle-Delivery Target, but CEO Musk Says Demand Remains Strong

387,20-Oct-22,Los Angeles Times,"BUSINESS; Tesla sales miss Wall St. target; The carmaker blames production, delivery problems; Musk insists demand is strong.",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2726104729/BFD812D457A14912PQ/229?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc. reported sales that fell short of Wall Street estimates, citing delivery and production bottlenecks, but Chief Executive Elon Musk assured investors that demand for his company's cars remains strong.
Getting cars onto ships and trucks proved especially costly and troublesome in the latest quarter, as much of the electric-vehicle maker's output was concentrated in the final weeks of the period.
That made it tough for Tesla to deliver all the vehicles it promised -- and led Musk to address concerns that demand may be faltering.

""We have excellent demand for Q4 and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into the future as we can see,"" he said on a conference call with analysts and investors Wednesday. ""Knock on wood, it looks like we'll have an epic end of year.""
No production surplus over the last two years even comes close to the 22,093 excess vehicles that Tesla reported in the third quarter.
Investors are paying close attention to how quickly Tesla can increase output of its mass-market Model Y SUV from new factories in Austin and Berlin -- a key milestone for the pioneering EV maker.
The company blamed its sales miss on difficulties in shipping vehicles at the end of the quarter and said profit growth was tempered by higher costs related to a slower-than-expected ramp-up at its two newest factories.
Tesla said third-quarter revenue rose to $21.5 billion, compared with analysts' projections of $22.1 billion. Profit excluding some items rose to $1.05 a share, exceeding the $1.01 average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

388,21-Oct-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla Stock Could Rebound in 3 Months. Here's What it Would Take.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2727048856/BFD812D457A14912PQ/59?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk says that Tesla could someday be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco, combined. First, it needs to get through the next few months.
Before Tesla (ticker: TSLA) reported third-quarter earnings this past week, investors had been hoping they would allay concerns that had been growing since the company released second-quarter numbers three months earlier. They did no such thing. While earnings topped expectations, third-quarter deliveries, sales, and profit margins all fell short of Street projections. Tesla shares slumped 6.7% following the release, putting them down 22% since the end of September, their second-worst start to a quarter since the first few weeks of 2016.
But for all the bad news, Tesla sees massive growth in 2023, as new plants in Germany and Texas continue ramping up. Tesla's long-term bets on batteries and new vehicles should also help it lower costs and boost sales, though it remains to be seen whether growth comes at the expense of profits.
What's more, Tesla still plans to deliver at least 450,000 vehicles during the fourth quarter, a massive number that, if achieved, would likely make the concerns disappear. While giving up on Tesla, or at least its stock, might strike some investors as the path of least resistance, giving the shares another three months seems to be the smart thing to do.
The nervousness pervading Wall Street about Tesla is palpable. Since the electric-vehicle maker reported, the average analyst's price target on its stock has slid more than 4%, to $287. Among the most pressing concerns: Gross automotive profits per car, excluding regulatory credits, have fallen from a record $15,700 in the first quarter to $14,700 in the second and $14,300 in the third from an average car price of $54,000.
Arresting that profit decline is important, but Tesla also wants to hit its goal of 50% average volume growth in 2024, and that likely means a new manufacturing plant and introducing a lower-priced model to expand its market and fend off growing EV competition. The worry is that Tesla might end up looking more like Toyota (TM), which earns about $4,400 selling cars that average about $30,000 each, than the highly profitable company it is now. ""The margin compression story is a worry and feeds into the bear thesis on Tesla,"" says Wedbush analyst Dan Ives , who has an Outperform rating on the stock.
New vehicles, however, are the future of Tesla. On the company's conference call, CEO Elon Musk said that a vehicle platform supporting a $30,000 compact EV is now the primary focus of his development team. That's for good reason—more than half of the cars sold in the U.S., excluding trucks, sell for under $36,000. ""The new Tesla $30,000 compact is a big deal that investors may be missing,"" says Future Fund Active ETF co-founder Gary Black . ""It dramatically expands Tesla's addressable market.""
Also broadening that market, to a much lesser extent, is the much-delayed Cybertruck, set to hit roads in 2023—some 3.5 years after it was launched. It will have an estimated base price of $40,000 to $70,000, depending on configuration.
Other Tesla businesses are expanding, as well. Tesla's energy-storage deployments hit 2,100 megawatt hours in the third quarter, up from 1,295 in the third quarter of 2021. And Tesla said it has tripled production of its larger-size battery cells, dubbed 4680s, though the introduction of those is still behind schedule. Significant 4680 output ""was not as far off as I feared,"" says Ross Gerber , CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management, who notes that these batteries will help drive down product costs and improve vehicle performance.
Most important, while Tesla acknowledged that it won't be able to deliver the 500,000 vehicles during the fourth quarter needed to hit 50% growth in 2022, guidance from CFO Zachary Kirkhorn implies that its fourth-quarter deliveries should top at least 450,000. That exceeds Wall Street projections and would be a quarterly record by some 100,000 units.
A number in that range would make 50% volume growth in 2023 look feasible. It would also signal that margins are set to improve because efficiency and production speeds in Texas and Germany are rising, boosting the potential profit on each vehicle produced. ""Short term, investors may focus on [margins] and demand being a little harder,"" wrote RBC analyst Joseph Spak in a report following earnings. ""However, midterm, we aren't too worried about demand [and] see [a] path back to 30% [gross margin].""
But first, Tesla has to get through the next week. Musk is likely to complete his purchase of Twitter (TWTR) before Oct. 28—if the U.S. government doesn't block the deal—for $54.20 a share, something that would necessitate his selling $5 billion to $10 billion in Tesla stock to help fund the purchase.
Investors don't want to buy Tesla shares ahead of the large sale, which perhaps explains some of the stock's recent weakness. With the deal set to close, Musk's sales should be done soon. If the stock fails to hold around $200 through that sale, the downside risk is immense, says 22V managing director John Roque . ""A break of $200 will suggest risk to $100,"" he says.
In all, a lot will be clearer in three months. If Tesla pulls through, that could be a good time for investors to pounce.

With the sharp drop in shares of Tesla (ticker: TSLA) this year, the market value of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) is approaching that of the leader in electric vehicles.
Berkshire, led by longtime CEO Warren Buffett, is demonstrating its defensive attributes in a bear market with its class A share down about 4.7% this year to—against a nearly 21% decline in the S&P 500 index.
Tesla stock is off 43%, reflecting some recent disappointment on vehicle deliveries and the sharp pullback in growth stocks. CEO Elon Musk's pursuit of Twitter (TWTR) hasn't helped. Berkshire sits on what Buffett, 92, calls a Fort Knox balance sheet with over $100 billion in cash and equivalents, mostly U.S. Treasury bills. Investors will be eager to see how much of that cash Buffett deployed in the second quarter when Berkshire reports financial results in early November.
Berkshire Hathaway now has about the same market value as Tesla at $632 billion, as Warren Buffett has caught Elon Musk. Berkshire shares were up 0.8% at $430,900 while Tesla stock was down 6.6% at $200.25. Berkshire has about 1.47 million shares outstanding based on Class A and the equivalent amount of Class B shares. Tesla has nearly 3.16 billion outstanding.
At the start of 2022, Tesla was valued at $1.1 trillion, $450 billion more than Berkshire.
Berkshire already has blown past flagging Meta Platforms (META) and Nvidia (NVDA) this year to rank sixth in the S&P 500 by market value. Berkshire is behind Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Tesla. Shares of Meta and Nvidia, which outranked Berkshire in the S&P 500 at the beginning of 2022, are both down about 60% this year.
If it can get past Tesla, Berkshire will be hard pressed to catch the No. 4 company, Amazon, which is valued at more than $1 trillion.
Berkshire's resilience this year shows the benefits of Buffett's methodical approach to building value over more than a half-century while providing sleep-at-night comfort to shareholders.

Prices for Tesla's popular Models Y and 3 sold in China, the world's biggest electric-vehicle market, have been cut by as much as 9.4%, according to a social-media post by the company Monday. A standard Model Y now costs the equivalent of $39,880, down from about $43,750, while the long-range version has an even bigger discount. A standard Model 3 fetches about $36,710, down by about $1,930.
The company has overcome production glitches and is seeing lower input costs but is facing greater competition amid a gloomy global economic outlook. Surging sales of new-energy vehicles are also driving intense competition for lithium, the key ingredient in vehicle batteries.
The discounts restore the models' price ranges closer to levels in early March. Tesla and other car manufacturers in China raised prices several times in the past year to adjust for increases in costs as the price of lithium almost tripled and they were ensnared by supply-chain delays. Tesla also raised prices for cars sold in the U.S. several times this year, citing inflationary pressure in materials and logistics.
Tesla didn't respond to a request for further comment.
Shares of Tesla closed down 1.5% to $211.25 on Monday. The drop comes as the stocks of U.S.-listed Chinese tech companies such as Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com and Pinduoduo fell by double-digit percentages following Xi Jinping's deepening his control over the world's second-largest economy this past weekend.
Mr. Musk, during a call with analysts last week to discuss the company's earnings, said that prices of most commodities are set to fall next year, which would lower costs, and warned of a ""brutal recession"" ahead. Prices for steel and aluminum have dropped while shipping container rates from Shanghai have collapsed, other company executives added.
Still, when asked whether Tesla would adjust its prices globally, Mr. Musk said only that the company was watching its costs closely. Lithium prices remained ""crazy expensive,"" he said.
Production conditions for China's car makers have returned to normal in recent months as delays in the supply chain caused by Beijing's stringent Covid-19 controls were smoothed out. Demand, however, remained weak, with retail car sales from August to September growing at their slowest pace in decades, according to the China Passenger Car Association's monthly release.
Tesla's Shanghai plant broke delivery records in September. The world's leading EV maker by units sold faces stiff competition from China's biggest EV car maker, BYD Co. The Shenzhen-based company in the past six months has outsold Tesla in its home market and is targeting global expansion as it pivots away from traditional internal combustion engines to focus solely on new-energy vehicles.
Tesla delivered more than 83,000 vehicles from its factory in China last month, up 8% from August. Globally, the company sold 908,600 over the first nine months of this year after ramping up production at its Shanghai factory in July. The factory in Shanghai accounted for more than half of its global production during this period.

391,25-Oct-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla Stock Price Targets March Lower as Bearish Options Activity Moves Higher,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2728161174/BFD812D457A14912PQ/110?accountid=13946,"This is quite a week for Tesla and CEO Elon Musk . More drama is coming.
For Tesla (ticker: TSLA), Wall Street analysts keep adjusting stock target prices lower following earnings . They are worried about demand.
For Musk, he is supposed to close his Twitter (TWTR) purchase by the end of the week to avoid a Delaware trial. That most likely means more Tesla stock sales from the CEO coming, essentially, now. The potential pending sale has traders circling, trying to make a quick buck.
Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas cut his Tesla price target to $330 from $350 a share. There are several things on his mind including a stronger dollar hurting Tesla sales. (Sales in other currencies such as the euro are worth less in U.S. dollars in that scenario).
With Jonas' cut, the average analyst price target for Tesla shares is down to about $285 from about $301 just before the company reported earnings on Oct. 19.
Along with foreign exchange, Jonas is also worried about demand. ""Many of our clients do not believe Tesla is vulnerable to a slowing consumer due to the company's unique position in the EV market and a general lack of supply,"" wrote Jonas. He disagreed. ""Tesla's increasingly large size today and in the forecast makes it susceptible to what could be some profound swings in consumer strength.""
He kept his Buy rating. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi , for his part, rates Tesla shares Sell. He has a $150 price target on the stock. Sacconaghi wrote Tuesday about demand too. He is worried that Tesla demand in China is waning, citing Tesla's recent price cuts in that country.
Falling demand is a huge long-term issue, but it's probably not what is driving some recent trading activity in short-dated Tesla stock options. On Monday, 144,858 Tesla put option contracts that expire on Friday with a $200 strike price exchanged hands. That contract traded 40,632 contracts on Friday.
That's a big jump for an option that only pays off if prices close below $200 a share. Tesla stock was at almost $218 in Tuesday trading, up 3% while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively.
(Options traders don't have to hold contract to expiry and can benefit from volatility too).
Holding those contracts seems risky. Traders seem to be betting that Tesla stock price will fall because Elon Musk is likely to sell a large block of stock to fund his Twitter buyout . Musk has only a few days to sell what could be $5 billion to $10 billion in Tesla stock. He's already sold about $15 billion in Tesla stock since making an offer to acquire Twitter and has arranged $30-plus billion in total funds to facilitate his takeover.
Large stock sales can drive down share prices for a time, but it's hard to predict how much and how long especially when everyone knows a stock sale is coming. What's more, Musk has more ways to raise money than just selling stock. He can use additional equity from third parties, margin loans or other deals struck with financiers.
Where Tesla stock will close the week is anyone's guess. All the fundamental research following earnings along with all the trading activity tied to Twitter news is almost certain to make the rest of the week wild for Tesla stock traders and long-term investors.

McCormick, top center, at the Delaware Chancery Court in September. The judge has given Elon Musk until Friday, Oct. 28, 2022, to close his long-promised, $44 billion deal to acquire Twitter. (Delaware Chancery Court via The New York Times) — NO SALES; FOR EDITORIAL USE ONLY. —
Elon Musk appears to be on track to close his blockbuster $44 billion deal for Twitter.
Musk, who runs Tesla and SpaceX, visited Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters Wednesday and tweeted a nine-second video of himself smiling and carrying a porcelain sink into the building.
“Entering Twitter HQ — let that sink in!” he wrote.
Musk, the world’s richest man, faces a Friday deadline to complete his purchase of Twitter, according to a judicial ruling. He is expected to attend a variety of meetings this week at the social media company, said three Twitter employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity. He is also set to address Twitter employees Friday, according to the employees and an internal note from Leslie Berland, the company’s chief marketing officer.
Musk, 51, also changed his profile on Twitter by describing himself as “Chief Twit” and marking his location as “Twitter HQ.”
A Twitter spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Musk’s appearance at Twitter’s offices suggests that he plans to close the deal after a drawn-out and tumultuous few months. The billionaire agreed to buy the company in April. But within weeks, he appeared to regret his decision and tried to back out.
Twitter then sued Musk to force him to abide by the deal contract, with the case scheduled to go to trial this month. This month, the billionaire changed his mind again and recommitted himself to the purchase. The Delaware Chancery Court judge in the case delayed the trial, giving a deadline of Oct. 28 for the deal’s completion.
Musk has promised to transform Twitter by taking it private, doing layoffs and nurturing subscription businesses. He has said he is a “free speech absolutist” and wants to loosen rules around content moderation on the service, including reversing the ban on former President Donald Trump from the platform. He has added that Twitter should become an “everything app” modeled after WeChat, a Chinese platform that offers social media, instant messaging and mobile payments.
Musk has spent the past three weeks finalizing the terms of his financing for the deal, which includes $12.5 billion in debt from Wall Street banks. Investment banks typically sell the debt they arrange for such deals to minimize risk that sits on their balance sheets. But given the quick pace at which Musk is now racing to close the deal, as well as the soured market for such debt, they are instead keeping that debt on their balance sheets at least for the time being, two people with knowledge of the situation said.
With so much uncertainty swirling over the deal, some of Twitter’s 7,500 employees have been jittery. Last week, the company sought to quell employee concerns after reports that Musk planned to lay off as many as 75% of them. Twitter told workers that the current management had no plans for layoffs but could make no promises about what Musk might do.
Employees who hope to remain at the company have also worried that their compensation might change. Under the terms of his agreement to buy Twitter, Musk assented to replace the stock options granted to employees with regularly scheduled cash bonuses. But because Musk has flip-flopped on other deal logistics, some employees have feared that he might not honor his compensation commitments.
On Wednesday, Berland encouraged Twitter’s employees to greet Musk if they saw him in the office.
“If you’re in SF and see him around, say hi!” she wrote in an email, which was obtained by The New York Times.
Musk last spoke with Twitter’s workers during a question-and-answer session in June.
“I want Twitter to contribute to a better, long-lasting civilization where we better understand the nature of reality,” he said at that meeting.

394,26-Oct-22,Barron's (Online),This Fund Has Found the Sweet Spot Between Growth and Value,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2728375365/BFD812D457A14912PQ/395?accountid=13946,"Professional investors often call mid-cap stocks the sweet spot between small- and large-cap stocks. They have the high growth potential of small companies but the stability and lower risk of blue-chips.
If that's true, John Roth and Nicola Stafford are in the sweet spot of that sweet spot. As the managers of the $6.6 billion Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock Fund (ticker: FMCSX), they favor neither the most overvalued growth companies nor the cheapest and, often, most financially distressed ones. They sit right in the middle between growth and value investing as a Mid-Cap Blend fund in Morningstar's fund category style box.
By seeking growth but paying close attention to valuation, the duo has triumphed. In the last five years Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock has beaten 95% of its peers in the Mid Blend category, with a 9.2% annualized return, versus the category average's 6.2%. In 2022's brutal bear market, Mid-Cap Stock has held up well, down 10%, versus the category's minus 17.5% average. The fund's 0.85% expense ratio is below average for its category.
Both Roth, 52, and Stafford, 42, are MIT grads and share an engineer's mind-set toward building a better mousetrap to balance both risk and reward in the fund's portfolio. ""I went to MIT undergrad to do mechanical engineering because I was drawn to everything about it,"" Stafford says. ""My favorite book as a child was The Way Things Work,"" a popular illustrated guide to how all sorts of machines and tools—lasers, cars, computers, zippers, etc.—work. Roth was the first person from Fidelity to interview Stafford at MIT while she was still trying to determine her career path.
""It was after meeting John and learning more about what investment management was, that I saw so many parallels between what drew me to engineering and what this job would be,"" Stafford says. ""Every day we try to understand industries. We try to not only break [the industry] down into what matters today, but to think about the future and anticipate who's well positioned and who's not."" Stafford is a Fidelity lifer; she has worked there since she started her career in 2001.
That Stafford was Roth's protégé from the start and his colleague for over 20 years is important as she will be taking over as the fund's sole manager when Roth retires at the end of 2022. She says the fund's ""investment philosophy and strategy, which John and I have built together, on behalf of our many shareholders"" will remain the same. ""The fund will continue to be supported by Fidelity's team of hundreds of equity research analysts globally.""
Roth was initially a stock trader but joined Fidelity as a summer intern while at MIT, then full-time in 1999 when he graduated. ""I went the opposite way of trading, which is a [short-term] tactic to make money,"" he says. ""Investing is where you can bring to bear a long-term perspective.""
That perspective is evident in the fund's low 17% portfolio turnover ratio, meaning the average stock is held for over five years. Roth's and Stafford's buy-and-hold philosophy applies to every kind of company. Their eclectic portfolio consists of energy stocks like Hess (HES) and Cheniere Energy (LNG), which are found in many value funds, but here they are held beside growth names like Elon Musk's SpaceX, a nonpublic investment.
Investing in mid-caps in the energy sector is advantageous, Roth says, because he can target specific subindustries. Large integrated oil companies like Exxon (XOM), are too diffuse in their industry exposure. Roth likes Cheniere because of its focus on liquefied natural gas or LNG. ""Nobody wants LNG facilities in the U.S., but it's a critical asset,"" he says. ""It allows producers to convert the commodity to a medium that can be shipped globally."" Today, with the fighting in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, Europe wants U.S. natural gas.
Similarly, Hess has a major offshore oil field discovery in Guyana, Roth says. Exxon has oil interests there too, but it has little impact on its bottom line as a giant company. So, Hess benefits more from its focus. Another favorite, Energy Transfer (ET), owns a gas pipeline . ""It's very difficult to add pipelines and expand pipelines in the U.S. right now,"" Roth says. ""So, they have this infrastructure that is not replaceable. It also generates a lot of cash, and [the stock] has an 8% dividend yield."" Having such unique assets gives companies a competitive edge.
On the growth side of the spectrum is SpaceX. A private rocket company , it was founded by Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla; the fund formerly owned Tesla until it grew too big to be a mid-cap. ""Because Mid-Cap Stock owned Tesla, we got to know Elon Musk and understand him as a business person,"" Roth says. Seeing the engineering and business difficulties Tesla overcame building a scalable electric-car business, gave Roth confidence that a rocket one was ""pretty easy"" in comparison: ""The secret sauce at SpaceX is this ability to reuse the first-stage booster. That saves a tremendous amount of cost in the process.""
Roth and Stafford acquired 1.4 million private SpaceX shares between April 2016 and September 2017 for $14.3 million. As of the fund's annual report dated April 30, 2022, those shares were worth $78.2 million. Because private equity is illiquid, typically such investments are only a few percentage points of the portfolio, 3% recently, but they can add oomph to returns.
Despite 2022's downturn, the team has struggled to find publicly traded tech stocks that meet their valuation criteria. ""That's an area where since I joined the fund, we've been systematically lightening up,"" Stafford says. As of Sept. 30, the fund's tech weighting was 6.7%, versus 12.4% for its benchmark, the S&P MidCap 400.
One tech favorite is WNS (WNS), a global IT and business-process outsourcing company based in Mumbai. ""In this uncertain [economic] environment, it has an appealing business model,"" Stafford says. ""We think demand is going to stay resilient, as clients increasingly focus on cost savings, which lends itself to outsourcing. It has defensive characteristics at a reasonable valuation.""
Resilient would also describe Mid-Cap Stock's record as it tries to balance growth stocks like WNS and inexpensive value ones like Energy Transfer.

395,26-Oct-22,Barron's (Online),Musk's Twitter Deal Is Happening. Can His Magic Work on the Tech World?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2728430989/BFD812D457A14912PQ/512?accountid=13946,"It's happening. Elon Musk's bankers have fallen into line, helping the billionaire and Tesla CEO secure financing for his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter.
Shares have climbed close to the sale price of $54.20. That suggests that investors see only the slightest chance that the deal will fall through before the court-ordered deadline of Friday.
It may have been a long and winding road to get here, with arguments over bots and Musk's attempts to back out. But the takeover couldn't come at a better time. The sector needs a boost.
Technology companies are having a rough ride . Google parent Alphabet missed earnings expectations for the third quarter as advertising took a hit. Microsoft beat expectations, but still fell on concerns that the cloud computing unit Azure is facing a slowdown. Microchip maker Texas Instruments, typically the bellwether for the industry, sounded the alarm as well. Facebook parent Meta and Amazon are reeling before they even report results.
The most frightening thing is perhaps that there's plenty of room for stocks to fall further. Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in an Oct. 25 note that markets haven't actually priced in a U.S. recession. That means that shares could take another sizeable leg down if the economy doesn't achieve a soft landing.
Musk is usually never shy about doling out advice. Twitter has been criticized by lots of people for failing to make more money from its wide user base.
Now is Musk's big chance to shine. Unfortunately, taking Twitter private might mean that we won't know much about what he actually does until he decides to make it public again.

Elon Musk Faces Friday Deadline to Close Twitter Acquisition
Elon Musk has until 5 p.m. Eastern time on Friday to close his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter or face a legal battle in Delaware Chancery Court next month. Wall Street likely won't be comfortable until control of the company officially changes hands, amid concerns it could still unravel last-minute.
* On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Musk has told co-investors in the deal, including Sequoia Capital, Binance, and Qatar Investment Authority, that he plans to close the deal by Friday. Bloomberg reported Musk told bankers handling the $13 billion in financing he would close by then.
* The financing means Twitter is adding debt to its books, which analysts estimate could put Twitter's annual interest payments above $1 billion. Twitter has in the past five years averaged annual earnings of about $700 million before interest, taxes and depreciation, The Wall Street Journal reported .
* Twitter aims to boost revenue, expand profit and wring out more efficiencies. Twitter significantly slowed hiring in the second quarter, and Musk's lawyers have written in court filings that economic uncertainty could necessitate job cuts to control costs.
* Banks are facing paper losses of $500 million on the debt they are arranging in the deal, the Journal reported. They aren't selling it right away as a buyout financing might normally be syndicated. Instead, by holding it on their books they can wait until market pricing improves.
What's Next: Roy Behren, co-president and co-chief investment officer at Westchester Capital Management, told Barron's that the deal is likely to close by or shortly after Friday's deadline, noting that the Delaware court judge ""has shown no patience for Musk's team's tactics.""

Google's Alphabet Hit by Weakness in YouTube, Search Ads
Google parent Alphabet posted its fifth-consecutive quarter of slowing revenue growth. It was its lowest sales growth since mid-2020 amid a slump in digital advertising as companies try to rein in costs.
* Alphabet's shares fell nearly 6% in after-hours trading after it reported revenue of $69.1 billion, up 6.1% from the third quarter last year but below what analysts expected. This year's results compare to a 41% gain in sales last year. Earnings were $1.06 a share.
* Search revenue rose 4.3% and YouTube ad revenue fell 0.2%. Combined, Google ad sales missed expectations by more than $2 billion, MarketWatch reported. It was the first time YouTube sales have dropped since 2020.
* Analysts expected earnings of $1.26 a share on total revenue of $71 billion, according to FactSet. CEO Sundar Pichai said the company would take steps, including focusing on products that improve search with artificial intelligence, and scaling back hiring and other costs.
* Revenue from Google cloud rose 38%, to $6.9 billion and was growing at a slightly faster pace than the second quarter, though it ranks behind bigger cloud firms such as Amazon.com.
What's Next: Facebook parent Meta Platforms is scheduled to report its second quarter in a row of declining advertising revenue later today, after the closing bell. Analysts expect revenue of $27.4 billion, according to FactSet, which would fall below the second quarter and the third quarter 2021.

Microsoft's Forecast Disappoints on Cloud Weakness
Microsoft's outlook disappointed investors, sending shares down more than 6% in after-hours trading, as it forecast revenue that would be $2 billion lower than expected for the fiscal second quarter. It reported lower-than-expected revenue growth in its cloud computing division in the first quarter.
* Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood gave a revenue outlook in a range of $52.35 billion to $53.35 billion, while analysts were expecting $56.16 billion. ""Intelligent cloud"" revenue is now forecast around $21.25 billion to $21.55 billion, while average expectations were $21.82 billion.
* The guidance came after Microsoft reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, with revenue of $50.1 billion, up 11%, and net income of $17.6 billion, down 14%. That was the biggest quarterly net income drop in two years and the lowest revenue growth in five, The Wall Street Journal reported .
* Intelligent cloud includes its Azure segment, where revenue rose 35%, which was slower than the average analyst forecast, according to FactSet. Microsoft's ""productivity and business processes"" segment, which includes Office and other software, had revenue of $16.5 billion, up 9%.
* Microsoft is reportedly cutting nearly 1,000 jobs across multiple divisions, according to reports last week. ""Like all companies, we evaluate our business priorities on a regular basis, and make structural adjustments accordingly,"" a Microsoft spokeswoman said in a statement to the Journal.
What's Next: While Microsoft's videogame console Xbox had a 3% drop in revenue in the most recent quarter, it could gain more significance down the road. Microsoft is awaiting regulatory approval for its $75 billion deal for Activision Blizzard and wants to close it by next June.

Pound Recovers on New Prime Minister, Weaker Dollar
The British pound has recovered to levels last seen before last month's fiscal statement, which sent investors fleeing from U.K. assets and toppled former prime minister Liz Truss.
* Sterling briefly rose above $1.16 on Wednesday, its highest level since Sept. 23, when the fiscal plan presented by Truss threw markets into turmoil. New Prime Minister Rishi Sunak distanced himself from the tax-cutting plans of his predecessor after his appointment on Tuesday.
* The rally was partly helped by a weakening of the dollar after data showed U.S. home price growth slowed in August and a fall in U.S. consumer confidence. The U.S. Dollar Index on Wednesday was down 0.8% at 110.09.
* Currencies of countries with looser monetary policies are still close to multidecade lows against the greenback, driven by the Fed's rate-hiking cycle. The Japanese yen on Wednesday traded at 146.98 to the dollar, having last week reached more than 150 to the dollar, its weakest level since 1990. China's yuan fell last Friday to its weakest level against the dollar since 2008.
What's Next: Further currency moves could be driven by investors looking to take advantage of the strong dollar to snap up foreign assets, as well as any hints the Fed could slow rate hikes for fear of driving the U.S. economy into recession, which could weaken the dollar.

Tennessee, Florida Gulf Coast Still Lure Luxury Home Buyers
Luxury housing spots from during and before the pandemic are holding their own as the rest of the real estate market weakens amid soaring mortgage interest rates, including spots in Tennessee surrounding the city of Nashville and spots along Florida's Gulf Coast.
* The area including Davidson, Murfreesboro and Franklin, Tenn., is the top destination for luxury home buyers for the second straight quarter, according to The Wall Street Journal/Realtor.com Emerging Housing Markets Index for the third quarter. Three other metro areas in the top five were in Florida.
* Although the migration of high-net-worth individuals out of densely populated cities has slowed, it has created opportunities in urban markets, the data found. Places like Nashville offer affordability for buyers from high-cost markets such as New York, Chicago or San Francisco.
* Charleston, N.C., ranked second on the list, followed by Florida markets North Port-Sarasota-Bradenton; Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater; and Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island, respectively.
* Home price growth more broadly slowed in August . The Case-Shiller index tracking home prices nationally was 13% higher than the same month last year, down from an annual gain of 15.6% in July. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the index fell the most since February 2010.
What's Next: The same forces that weighed on home prices this summer are likely to dent year-over-year home price gains in the following months. The National Association of Realtors has said that the median home sale price in September was $384,800, down about 7% from an all-time high in June.

Dear Quentin,
My boyfriend owns a house with a 30-year mortgage balance of $150,000 on a 4% interest rate. He has $275,000 in cash and retirement accounts. He is retired.
My house is paid off. I have $50,000 in cash and retirement accounts. I would like to retire within one to two years.
We wish to cohabitate but have not been able to agree on a fair ""rent"" to pay. He is not willing to live in my house because it has fewer amenities.
He believes I should pay half of his monthly cost at his nicer, more expensive house. He could pay off his mortgage and save $600 a month, but he likes to have cash.
I have foregone that luxury and paid off my mortgage. I am now working on building my savings. I don't feel it is fair for me to pay half of the mortgage interest expense.
I don't know what repair and maintenance costs should be expected from me, if I have no equity in his house. There are many points of view, none of which feels fair.
These are the options he set forth:
· I live in his house and thus get to rent mine out. Pay him half of what I net from that rental.
· Pay half of the actual costs of living expenses and upkeep on his house while I live there.
· Pay him what I pay to live in my current home for taxes, insurance, and utilities: $800/month.

Madison Avenue isn't sold on the deal.
Advertisers are concerned about the billionaire's plans to soften content moderation and what they say are potential conflicts of interest in auto advertising, given that he is chief executive of Tesla Inc., say people familiar with the situation.
 Mr. Musk said this spring that as owner of Twitter he would reinstate former President Donald Trump's account, which the platform suspended indefinitely after linking Mr. Trump's comments to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot . That would be a red line for some brands, said Kieley Taylor, global head of partnerships at GroupM, a leading ad-buying agency that represents blue-chip brands.
About a dozen of GroupM's clients, which own an array of well-known consumer brands, have told the agency to pause all their ads on Twitter if Mr. Trump's account is reinstated, Ms. Taylor said. Others are in wait-and-see mode. Ms. Taylor said she expects to hear from many more clients if Mr. Trump's account returns.
""That doesn't mean that we won't be entertaining lots of emails and phone calls as soon as a transaction goes through,"" Ms. Taylor said. ""I anticipate we'll be busy.""
In a message to advertisers on Twitter on Thursday, Mr. Musk said he was buying the company to ""have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner."" He said Twitter ""cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!"" Mr. Musk said in addition to following laws, Twitter must be ""warm and welcoming to all.""
He said Twitter aims to be a platform that ""strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise.""
Twitter's chief customer officer, Sarah Personette, tweeted that she had a discussion with Mr. Musk on Wednesday evening. ""Our continued commitment to brand safety for advertisers remains unchanged,"" she wrote. ""Looking forward to the future!""
Mr. Trump has said he wouldn't rejoin Twitter even if allowed. Representatives for Tesla and Mr. Trump didn't respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Musk is nearing completion of the acquisition of Twitter after a monthslong legal battle in which he tried to back out of the $44 billion deal he agreed to in April. The judge overseeing the legal fight said if the deal doesn't close by Friday she will schedule a November trial.
Twitter sent an email to some ad buyers earlier this week letting them know that the company is working with ""the buyer"" to close the acquisition by Friday and to acknowledge that Twitter is aware that advertisers have a lot of questions, according to the email, which was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The email, which didn't name Mr. Musk, said Twitter would work ""with the potential buyer to answer quickly.""
Advertising provided 89% of Twitter's $5.08 billion revenue in 2021. Mr. Musk has said he hates advertising. In a series of tweets earlier this year, he suggested Twitter should move toward subscriptions and remove ads from Twitter Blue, a premium program that gives users additional features.
Mr. Musk describes himself as a ""free speech absolutist"" and has said Twitter should be more cautious about removing tweets or banning users.
Mr. Musk may have reasons to avoid any drastic changes to Twitter's ad business. Twitter will take on $13 billion in debt in the deal. The online ad markets already are shaky, amid concerns about the economy, with Snap Inc. and Alphabet Inc. posting lower-than-expected revenue results for the September quarter .
Like other ad-supported social-media platforms, Twitter provides advertisers with adjacency controls, tools that are meant to ensure ads don't appear next to certain content the brands deem objectionable.
Some ad buyers said Twitter lags behind its competitors in providing so-called brand safety features. Joshua Lowcock, global chief media officer at UM Worldwide, an ad agency owned by Interpublic Group of Cos., called Twitter's adjacency controls inadequate and ""poorly thought through.""
Ad agency Omnicom Media Group evaluates the major social-media platforms' progress on brand-safety tools every quarter. In July, Omnicom rated Twitter's progress behind that of YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Reddit, according to a document reviewed by the Journal. Robert Pearsall, managing director of social activation at Omnicom Media Group, said Twitter has made agreements to improve its brand-safety controls to meet Omnicom's standards, but it hasn't introduced those changes to the market yet.
""There are significant concerns about the implications of a possible change to content moderation policy,"" he said. Twitter has said it is working on tools to give advertisers a better idea of where their ads appear.
Automotive manufacturers have expressed concerns about advertising on Twitter under Mr. Musk's ownership, given his role at electric-vehicle juggernaut Tesla, some ad buyers said. Advertisers often share data with Twitter and other platforms—on their own customers or people that are in the market for a car—to help target their ads at the right people. Some auto companies will be wary of doing so, out of concern that data may leak to Tesla, the buyers said.
Though Twitter relies on ad dollars, it isn't one of the biggest players in the digital ad economy. The company gets about 1.1% of U.S. digital ad spending, according to Insider Intelligence, a much smaller slice than Google, Meta Platforms Inc. or Amazon.com Inc.
Already, there have been signs of anxiety on Madison Avenue about Mr. Musk's takeover of Twitter. In July, the company reported a 1% decrease in second-quarter revenue, which it blamed on uncertainty over the deal as well as broader pressures in the digital ad market.
Given Mr. Musk's past remarks on advertising, some advertisers wonder if Mr. Musk may exit the ad business entirely.
""The question we keep getting asked is: Do we think Musk will turn off ads completely?"" said UM Worldwide's Mr. Lowcock.

397,27-Oct-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Elon Musk Completes $44 Billion Deal to Own Twitter,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2729311211/BFD812D457A14912PQ/288?accountid=13946,"In an undated image provided by Delaware Chancery Court, Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick, top center, at the Delaware Chancery Court in September. The judge has given Elon Musk until Friday, Oct. 28, 2022, to close his long-promised, $44 billion deal to acquire Twitter. (Delaware Chancery Court via The New York Times) — NO SALES; FOR EDITORIAL USE ONLY. —

SAN FRANCISCO — After months of waffling, lawsuits, verbal mudslinging and the near miss of a full-blown trial, Elon Musk now owns Twitter.
On Thursday night, Musk closed his $44 billion deal to buy the social media service, said three people with knowledge of the situation. He also began cleaning house, with at least four top Twitter executives — including the CEO and chief financial officer — getting fired Thursday. Musk had arrived at Twitter’s San Francisco headquarters Wednesday and met with engineers and ad executives.
The closing of the deal, which followed months of drama and legal challenges as Musk changed his mind about buying the company, sets Twitter on an uncertain course. Musk, a self-described “free speech absolutist,” has said that he wants to make the social media platform a more freewheeling place for all types of commentary and that he would “reverse the permanent ban” of former President Donald Trump from the service.
Musk’s open approach to speech on Twitter could exacerbate long-simmering issues of toxic content and misinformation, affecting political debates around the world. Early tests will come within days, when Brazil elects its president and American voters go to the polls Nov. 8 for the midterm elections. Twitter said it would prohibit misleading claims about voting and the outcome of elections, but that was before Musk owned it.
“There could be real-world consequences to his leadership,” David Kaye, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, who worked with the United Nations on issues of free speech, said of Musk’s ownership of Twitter. “To the extent that world leaders see they have this space and it’s unmoderated, they could push to see how far they can go.”
The acquisition has been celebrated by some Republicans, who have argued that Twitter censored conservative viewpoints. Researchers have said Twitter’s rules have been essential to countering online hate speech and disinformation. Some advertisers have worried about allowing their brands to appear alongside controversial tweets.

“It’s a ‘back-to-the-future’ reversion to content rules circa 2010, but one that ignores the lived experience over the last decade,” said Colin Crowell, Twitter’s former head of global public policy, who left the company in 2019. “People eventually realize that the Wild West needs a sheriff, both for ensuring the safety of citizens but also for enhancing the prospects for commerce.”

Musk has promised other sweeping changes at Twitter, including new leadership, job cuts and the pursuit of new ways to make money. Twitter, which employs more than 7,500 people, has had difficulties consistently growing its advertising-based business and attracting new users. The firings of the top company executives Thursday were a sign that Musk intended to move swiftly.
Musk, 51, will be remaking Twitter without having to disclose how it is performing every few months. By taking the company private, he does not need to regularly answer to shareholders and can make changes to the service away from the public’s prying eyes.
Musk, who also runs electric carmaker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Completing the deal was a victory for Twitter’s board. When Musk agreed to pay $54.20 a share for the company in April, Twitter faced criticism for accepting a price that was too low. But, as the global economy faltered in the ensuing months and Twitter’s stock fell, the deal price appeared to be a win for shareholders, and the board sought to force Musk to abide by the agreement.
A Twitter spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Twitter executives who were fired Thursday include Parag Agrawal, the CEO; Ned Segal, the chief financial officer; Vijaya Gadde, the top legal and policy executive; and Sean Edgett, the general counsel, said two people with knowledge of the matter. At least one of the executives who was fired was escorted out of Twitter’s office, they said.
Musk, who is one of Twitter’s most active users and has more than 109 million followers, began accumulating shares in the company this year. In April, he struck the deal to buy the company for $44 billion and said he would lift Twitter’s content moderation policies, eliminate spam, add new features and provide more transparency about the algorithms used to promote content.
“Twitter has tremendous potential — I look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock it,” he said in a statement in April.
But, within weeks, he began questioning the deal. Musk lashed out at the Twitter executives responsible for content decisions and accused the company of failing to accurately count the spam accounts on its platform. When Agrawal tried debunking Musk’s claims, Musk responded by tweeting a poop emoji.
By July, Musk had decided that he no longer wanted to own Twitter, arguing that he had been misled about the amount of spam on the platform. He announced his intent to abandon the acquisition.
Twitter sued Musk to force him to carry out the agreement. The company accused Musk of trying to back out of the deal because the economic downturn had caused a decline in his personal wealth. Musk had agreed to personally provide roughly $33 billion of the $44 billion deal.
The lawsuit ended up in Delaware Chancery Court, which hears many corporate cases. The court set a five-day trial in mid-October to hear the case.
But facing days of depositions and an uncertain outcome, Musk reconsidered. He tried negotiating a discount on the deal price. Those discussions were unsuccessful. This month, Musk said he would proceed with the acquisition at the original price if Twitter halted its legal battle against him.
The judge overseeing Twitter’s lawsuit agreed to put the case on hold until Oct. 28, giving Musk three weeks to close the deal.
Musk has set some ambitious goals for Twitter, which he has said he will transform into an “everything app” called X. In presentations to investors about the deal this spring, he said he anticipated that Twitter would reach annual revenue of $26.4 billion and have 931 million users by 2028. The company reported $5.08 billion in revenue last year and had more than 200 million users.
Musk has suggested that cuts could be necessary to limit Twitter’s costs. Many of the company’s employees could face layoffs. In recent days, Twitter has tried soothing its workforce, asking employees to ignore reports of potential layoffs.

Twitter’s performance will be vital as Musk balances investing in the company’s future and paying off interest on the $12.5 billion in loans he took out to finance the deal. Analysts have questioned whether Twitter can bear the burden of those payments given its patchy profits.
Those loans will also stand as a pain point for the investment banks that cobbled them together, as the market for such loans has dropped precipitously since Musk announced his bid in April.

Advertisers may also be wary of doing business with Musk after he denounced the use of advertising on Twitter and said the company should find a different source of revenue. Some advertisers have also been skeptical about their brands appearing alongside risky content that Musk has said should be allowed on Twitter, while others have preferred to spend money with social networks like Facebook and TikTok.
On Thursday, Musk sought to quell advertiser concerns with an open letter suggesting some content moderation would continue.
“Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences,” he wrote. “Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world.”

398,27-Oct-22,The Washington Post,"Musk dubs himself 'Chief Twit,' visits Twitter's offices",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2728807032/BFD812D457A14912PQ/458?accountid=13946,"

SAN FRANCISCO - Elon Musk is on track to buy Twitter. For real this time.
The world's richest person showed up at Twitter's San Francisco headquarters Wednesday for meetings with executives and changed his bio on Twitter to ""Chief Twit.""
The moves signal the $44 billion deal is on track to close this week, something echoed by people close with Musk who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Financing is lining up to finalize the deal.
Twitter's stock closed at $53.35 - just under Musk's offer of $54.20, signaling the market believes it will go through, too.
It's a far cry from just a few weeks ago, when Twitter and Musk were locked in litigation after the Tesla chief executive attempted to back out of his deal to acquire the social media company, citing problems with spam and bots.
On his Twitter account Wednesday, Musk praised the company's capacity for enabling ""citizen journalism"" and said entities such as local news organizations ""should get way more prominence"" on the site.
Twitter's chief marketing officer, Leslie Berland, sent an email to staff Wednesday morning saying Musk would be in the San Francisco offices and encouraged employees to ""say hi,"" according to a copy viewed by The Washington Post.
Musk later tweeted a video showing him walking into the company's reception area.
Twitter spokeswoman Rebecca Hahn confirmed a companywide communication that said Musk would address the company on Friday.
Musk is funding a large portion of the deal through debt from a group of seven major banks. Spokespeople for Bank of America, BNP Paribas and Societe Generale did not respond to a request for comment. Spokespeople for Barclays, Morgan Stanley, Mizuho and MUFG declined to comment.
Musk's team was pitching investors throughout the weekend, the people said, as they looked to lessen his financial burden in the deal.
Musk shifted his opinion on whether to buy the company after a series of losses in Delaware Chancery Court in matters related to scheduling and discovery, according to the people close to Musk and his team. A loss became a serious possibility if the matter went to trial, risking penalties beyond merely the buying cost. And the blows to Tesla's stock and Musk's net worth became a lingering concern.
Musk acknowledged overpaying for the site during Tesla's earnings call last week.
Musk also took solace in his debt and equity commitments, which locked him into the deal on favorable terms that might not be otherwise available, the people said. And he became excited by his plans for the site.
The Post reported last week that Musk laid out plans to lay off nearly three-fourths of Twitter's staff as he seeks to implement aggressive cost-cutting and loosen the site's content moderation standards.
The initial phase of his ownership will focus on talent - and Musk is expected to look to his other companies, Tesla and SpaceX, to seek out specialists who might help Twitter reverse its fortunes, the people said.

The Tesla (ticker: TSLA) CEO said in an open letter to Twitter advertisers that most of the speculation about why he bought Twitter and what he thinks about advertising is wrong. He also clarified that the platform, ""obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!""
""Fundamentally, Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise,"" Musk wrote.
Twitter Chief Customer Officer Sarah Personette shared Musk's post and said she had a ""great discussion"" with the billionaire.
""Our continued commitment to brand safety for advertisers remains unchanged,"" she added. ""Looking forward to the future!""
Musk's post comes as advertisers and industry experts have tried to grapple with Musk's stated plans for a Twitter as a ""digital town square"" with fears from brands that their ads could be displayed near objectionable but legal content.
The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that some advertisers are indeed worried about Musk's potential impact on moderation. Kieley Taylor, global head of partnerships at ad-buying agency GroupM, told the Journal that a dozen of its clients have told the agency to pause ads on Twitter if former President Donald Trump is reinstated. Trump was suspended from Twitter following the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot, but Musk has said he would undo the ban. The Journal described GroupM's clients as ""an array of well-known consumer brands.""
Twitter stock was up 1.1% to $53.96 Thursday, which should be its final day of trading. That is just a tick below the $54.20 that Twitter stockholders will receive from Musk for each share they own. The New York Stock Exchange says on its website that Twitter trading will be suspended before the market's open on Friday, ahead of Musk's 5 p.m. deadline to close the deal. 
Musk seems to be on track. He retweeted a photo shared by biographer Walter Isaacson of himself holding court at the coffee bar at Twitter's office. Multiple outlets reported Musk is set to address employees on Friday.

(Jefferson Siegel/The New York Times)
Forget about the endless drama, the bots, the abrupt reversals, the spectacle, the alleged risk to the republic and all we hold dear. Here is the most important thing about Elon Musk’s buying Twitter: The moguls have been unleashed.
In the old days, when a tech tycoon wanted to buy something big, he needed a company to do it. Steve Case used AOL to buy Time Warner. Jeff Bezos bought Whole Foods for Amazon. Mark Zuckerberg used Facebook to buy Instagram and WhatsApp and Oculus and on and on. These were corporate deals done for the bottom line, even if they might never have happened without a famous and forceful proprietor.
Musk’s $44 billion takeover of Twitter, which finally became a reality Thursday, six months after he agreed to the deal, is different. It is an individual buying something for himself that 240 million people around the world use regularly. While he has other investors, Musk will have absolute control over the fate of the short-message social media platform.
It’s a difficult deal to evaluate even in an industry built on deals, because this one is so unusual. It came about whimsically, impulsively. But, even by the standards of Silicon Valley, where billions are casually offered for fledging operations — and even by the wallet of Musk, on most days the richest man in the world — $44 billion is quite a chunk of change.
Buying Twitter is also an overwhelmingly brash action — a belief that a communications platform that has defied all efforts to become seriously profitable, and that has been ensnared in controversy about the limits of speech almost since its founding in 2006, can be easily fixed by one person.
If you have billions of dollars these days, however, belief in yourself is never in short supply.
Musk’s fortune comes from the electric carmaker Tesla, which he turned into the leading vehicle for changing how Americans drive, an uphill task if there ever was one. Musk and Bezos are separately vying to re-create the space program, which in the 1960s was deemed too important and too expensive to be run by anything except the federal government.
Zuckerberg has changed Facebook’s name to Meta and reoriented the company to create a virtual world where people will henceforth “live.” Peter Thiel, who co-founded the payments firm PayPal and was an early investor in Facebook, has become the midterm elections’ most prominent campaign contributor, pumping tens of millions of dollars into right-wing congressional candidates. Two of his former employees are the Republican nominees for senator in Ohio and Arizona.
Richard Walker, a professor emeritus of economic geography at the University of California, Berkeley and a historian of Silicon Valley, sees a shift in the locus of power.
“In this new Gilded Age, we’re being battered by billionaires rather than the corporations that were the face of the 20th century,” he said. “And the tech titans are leading the way.”

Even people who have been watching the tech scene closely for decades are stumped for precedents for Musk’s buying Twitter.
“Most of the guys built great companies, retired and created giant foundations to give away their money,” said Michael S. Malone, who has written histories of Apple, Intel and other companies. “Nobody has done something like this.” He counts himself a fan of Musk’s loosening of Twitter’s rules, though: “Making the place wide open will make it even crazier and more fun.”

Musk, who disbanded Tesla’s public relations department, didn’t respond to a message for comment.
Rich people have long wanted to own media properties, a tradition the tech titans have continued. Bezos bought The Washington Post for $250 million. Marc Benioff of Salesforce owns Time magazine. Pierre Omidyar of eBay developed a homegrown media empire.
Deals have been a feature of Silicon Valley as long as there has been a Silicon Valley. Often they fail, especially when the acquisition was made for technology that either quickly grew outdated or never really worked at all. At least one venerable company, Hewlett-Packard, followed that strategy and has practically faded away.
Dealogic, a data firm, compiled for The New York Times a list of the top 10 biggest tech deals since 1995 by deal value. By that measure, Musk’s purchase of Twitter is No. 10. Microsoft’s $70 billion-plus acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which is pending, has garnered a fraction of the attention despite being No. 2.
Activision Blizzard is merely a video game company. Musk has maintained from the beginning that buying Twitter isn’t a trophy or a game or a scheme to increase his net worth. Instead, he has cast it in the grandest terms possible.
“Having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization,” the entrepreneur said in April after sealing the deal. “I don’t care about the economics at all.”
He cared a little more when the subsequent plunge in the stock market meant that he was overpaying by a significant amount. Analysts estimated that Twitter was worth not $44 billion but $30 billion, or maybe even less. For a few months, Musk tried to get out of the deal.

This had the paradoxical effect of bringing the transaction down to earth for spectators. Who among us has not failed to do due diligence on a new venture — a job, a house, even a relationship — and then realized that it was going to cost so much more than we had thought? Musk’s buying Twitter, and then his refusal to buy Twitter, and then his being forced to buy Twitter after all — and everything playing out on Twitter — was weirdly relatable.
Inescapable, too. The apex, or perhaps the nadir, came this month when Musk introduced a perfume called Burnt Hair, described on its website as “the Essence of Repugnant Desire.”
“Please buy my perfume, so I can buy Twitter,” Musk tweeted on Oct. 12, garnering nearly 600,000 likes. This worked, apparently; the perfume is now marked “sold out” on its site. Did 30,000 people really pay $100 each for a bottle? Will this perfume actually be produced and sold? (It’s not supposed to be released until next year.) It’s hard to tell where the joke stops, which is perhaps the point.

Walker, the author of “Pictures of a Gone City: Tech and the Dark Side of Prosperity in the San Francisco Bay Area,” fears for the future.
“There’s no counterbalance to the new business moguls,” he said. “Unions, fraternal organizations and local media have been greatly weakened. The general public is cut off from these positive influences and awash in misinformation.”
If Musk’s buying Twitter signifies the beginning of something, it also, in another way, represents an ending. The other social media platforms are closely held by their founders through their companies’ share structures. No one could buy Facebook away from Zuckerberg without his agreement, or Snap from its chief co-founder, Evan Spiegel.
“What was unique about Twitter was that no one actually controlled it,” said Richard Greenfield, a media analyst at LightShed Partners. “And now one person will own it in its entirety.”
He is relatively hopeful, however, that Musk will improve the site, somehow. That, in turn, will have its own consequences.
“If it turns into a massive home run,” Greenfield said, “you’ll see other billionaires try to do the same thing.”

402,28-Oct-22,USA Today (Online),'Freed' bird: Day 1 of Elon Musk's Twitter and the social media platform's path forward,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2729408036/BFD812D457A14912PQ/273?accountid=13946,"For most market watchers or even casual observers of headlines over the last several years, the last 24 hours have been big: Elon Musk, the celebrated space entrepreneur, prolific and provocative Tweeter and the world's richest man, has finally closed his $44 billion purchase of Twitter. Elon Musk – who is also Tesla's CEO – confirmed the deal in less than 280 characters. He now holds one of the world's most powerful megaphones. Here's what you – and Musk's 110 million followers – need to know about his acquisition of the social media platform and his ownership of what he calls a ""digital town square."" That tweet was quickly met with a reply from European Union Internal Markets Commissioner Thierry Breton to Musk, who is a regular critic of international regulators.  Some far-right accounts see boost in followers, firm finds As Elon Musk closed the deal to take over Twitter, some influential conservative figures saw spikes in new followers, according to data from digital investigations company Memetica. Kari Lake, a Republican candidate for governor in Arizona, gained more than 18,000 new followers in the last 24 hours. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colorado), meanwhile, gained 18,679 new followers during the same period. And more than 3,700 accounts started following conservative media personality Candace Owens. Thousands of the accounts that have followed the far-right figures were new to Twitter, created shortly before the deal closed, according to Memetica.  Meanwhile, as reported by the New York Times, data from social media analytics firm Social Blade showed that accounts for progressive politicians and celebrities including former President Barack Obama, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), and MSNBC host Rachel Maddow were losing followers Friday. – Amanda Pérez Pintado Antisemitism spreads on Twitter after Musk takeover, ADL says The ADL Center on Extremism said it identified a coordinated effort to spread antisemitic content on Twitter following Musk’s takeover.  In the course of 24 hours, the ADL said more than 1,200 tweets and retweets propagated antisemitic memes. The effort began Thursday via an anonymous post on 4chan, which gave instructions on how to spread the content. The post was then shared on several extremist Telegram channels, according to the ADL. “This strategic spread of hateful content on @Twitter warrants concern for how extremists view potential changes to Twitter's content rules,” the organization tweeted. “The campaign also follows weeks of #antisemitic discourse being spread by public figures.” – Jessica Guynn Musk's many jobs: How many companies does he run now? With the takeover of Twitter, Musk now runs five companies in multiple industries: electric vehicle maker Tesla, rocket and satellite company SpaceX, tunneling company The Boring Company and neuroscience startup Neuralink. Investors worry that the competing demands on his time are stretching Musk too thin, particularly at a time when Twitter, Tesla and SpaceX all face challenges.  'Burnt Hair': Elon Musk sells millions worth of new perfume within hours of its release Love for money: Elon Musk's ex-girlfriend auctioning off signed love note, emerald necklace for thousands Tesla has acknowledged in regulatory filings that its dependence on Musk is a risk factor. “Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla,” the company said.  But Musk’s energizer-bunny pace has not appeared to put a damper on Tesla, the world’s most valuable car company, and SpaceX, one of the U.S.’s most valuable startups. Musk acknowledges that the intense workload gets to him. “It would be nice to have a bit more free time on my hands, as opposed to just working day and night from when I wake up till when I go to sleep seven days a week. It’s pretty intense,” he said last year during a Tesla analyst briefing. – Jessica Guynn How did Elon Musk pay for Twitter? Musk in April pledged $46.5 billion to finance the acquisition’s $44 billion price tag plus closing costs. The billionaire is using a combination of cash, bank loans and investment funds to finance the deal. Musk, who already owned nearly 10% of Twitter in market shares, is contributing more than $27 billion in cash for the deal after selling off more than $15 billion worth of Tesla shares earlier this year. Another $13 billion is backed by bank loans. Lenders include Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Mizuho, Morgan Stanley, MUFG and Societe Generale.  Then there's $5.2 billion from equity investors: $25 million from active investment firm A.M. Management & Consulting $400 million from AH Capital Management, a VC firm founded by Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz $360 million from SpaceX and Airbnb investor Aliya Capital Partners LLC  $100 million from investment adviser BAMCO  $500 million from cryptocurrency exchange Binance $250 million from Brookfield, an alternative investment management company $100 million from SpaceX and Tesla investor DFJ Growth IV Partners $316 million from investment advisor Fidelity Management & Research Company  $5 million from Honeycomb Asset Management, a private investment firm led by David Fiszel  $30 million from wealth management company Key Wealth Advisors $1 billion from Lawrence J. Ellison Revocable Trust, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison’s trust $25 million from consumer investment company Litani Ventures $375 million from Qatar Holding, a global investment house controlled by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund  $800 million from the venture capital firm Sequoia Capital Fund, which also invested in The Boring Company  $150 million from investment banking firm Strauss Capital  $8.5 million from Tresser Blvd 402  $700 million from VyCapital, a global technology investment firm that invested in The Boring Company $100 million from investment firm Witkoff Capital There were also nearly 35 million shares valued at $1.89 billion transferred from Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal. Musk says Twitter is forming content moderation council  Musk tweeted Friday that he'll be ""digging in"" on lifting shadow bans and rolling back restrictions on users. He later tweeted that Twitter would form a content moderation council ""with widely diverse viewpoints."" ""No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes,"" Musk said.  Twitter already has a council that advises on content moderation. It was not clear what would become of it. Facebook's Oversight Board offered to "" discuss Twitter's plans in more detail with the company."" “Independent oversight of content moderation has a vital role to play in building trust in platforms and ensuring users are treated fairly,"" the board said in a statement. This is a model we have been proving since 2020."" – Jessica Guynn Is Musk laying off Twitter employees?  Right after the deal closed Thursday, several executives including the CEO were fired.  On Friday, people who identified themselves as employees were seen leaving the company’s San Francisco headquarters carrying boxes, according to CNBC. But some Twitter employees speculated on company Slack channels that the departures were a hoax, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg. – Jessica Guynn Not sure if you want to stay on Twitter or what to keep from your account? Many of Twitter's estimated 250 million or so active users – out of its about 400 million registered users – are now wondering what could happen to their personal data on a platform owned by Musk. While some have committed to deleting their profiles entirely, others are waiting on the sidelines to see how the company might use their highly personal information or are leaning in further to up their presence now that content moderation is changing. Not sure which one is right for you? Check out our tutorials on how to stay safe online from harassment, download your Twitter content or leave the site altogether. Things getting nasty on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram? How to shut down the hate, harassment How to delete Twitter account? Step-by-step guide to permanently remove your account. – Riley Gutiérrez McDermid How to delete Twitter data Twitter handles some 500 million to 700 million tweets a day, which adds up to roughly 12 terabytes of data every 24 hours. That's a huge risk if that data falls into the wrong hands, Arthur Herman, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, recently wrote in Forbes – and Twitter had big data breaches before all of that information became Musk's. In July, a breach exposed the email address and phone number of 5.4 million Twitter profiles. At that time, Twitter recommended anyone trying to stay anonymous should not link a publicly known phone number or email to their Twitter account. Then in August, whistleblower Peiter Zatko exposed what he said was lax security at Twitter, which could make the company’s data vulnerable to foreign infiltration as well as improper use and storage of user data.  Now all that data – including your direct messages because they are not end-to-end encrypted – belongs to Elon Musk.  The data Twitter collects and saves includes your tweets, likes, direct messages, ad clicks, followers and those you’re following. If you’ve granted access, it can also collect information from your phone’s contact list.  If you’re concerned about your data privacy or considering leaving Twitter, here are a few things you can do:  To delete your account go to Settings → Your Account → Deactivate Your Account. This will not delete your data immediately because Twitter holds onto your data for at least 30 days in case you change your mind.  Before deleting, you may want to try a few other solutions:  Back up your tweets by going to Settings → Your Account → Download an Archive of Your Data.  You can delete all your old tweets, but not through Twitter itself. Use a third-party app like Tweetdelete.net. It can also delete all your old likes. Twitter says deleted tweets are not publicly available but it’s unclear how long they’re saved on the company’s servers.  If you’ve used Twitter DMs for private conversations you want to remove, you can delete an individual message from your account, but it will still exist for the other people in the conversation.  Lock down your account completely so only your followers can see them: Do this by going to Settings → Privacy and Safety → Audience and Tagging, then select Protect Your Tweets. Or you can stay public but protect your account from harassment by muting and blocking certain types of profiles. Go to Settings → Privacy and Safety → Mute and Block → Muted Notifications and you can choose to mute, for example, new accounts which could be spam or bots.  – Katie Wedell Trump says Twitter now in 'sane hands' Former president Donald Trump also weighed in on the Twitter deal Friday, saying in a post on his own social media platform, Truth Social, that he considers Musk's takeover to have placed the platform in ""sane hands."" – Riley Gutiérrez McDermid Musk will be 'digging in' on shadow bans as hate speech, slurs appear  Reports began surfacing early Friday that hate speech and racial epithets are flying on Twitter. Holocaust deniers were also reported on the platform. Twitter users were quick to note Friday that they were beginning to see changes in the way the platform worked and how it was removing bans on users previously limited on the site, sometimes as a direct result of tweeting Musk. In answer to that, Musk tweeted Friday that he'll be ""digging in"" more today on lifting shadow bans and rolling back restrictions on users. Far-right commentators, including well-known YouTuber Tim Pool, also weighed in about changes.  Users who had either had their content moderated or knew people who had encountered Twitter bans or shadow bans also tweeted Musk directly asking to have those lifted and listed the names of people they felt should be brought back to the platform. – Riley Gutiérrez McDermid When did Elon close his deal for Twitter? Multiple news outlets reported late Thursday that, after months of legal wrangling and public acrimony, Musk had closed the deal and fired top executives including the company's CEO Parag Agrawal. Twitter chairman Bret Taylor removed that title from his Twitter bio.  A deal is done? Elon Musk takes control of Twitter, sources say – Riley Gutiérrez McDermid Musk may need to pay as much as $200 million to fired executives Agrawal; Ned Segal, the chief financial officer; and Vijaya Gadde, the top legal and policy executive, all had strict contractual agreements in place for what might happen in the event of a takeover. MarketWatch reports that the three own about $65 million worth of Twitter stock and get another $119.6 million in stock if they are terminated. ""In total, Gadde is set to walk away from Twitter with the biggest haul: Nearly $74 million. Agrawal and Segal aren’t far behind her, though, at roughly $65 million and $66 million, respectively,"" MarketWatch said. Kanye West Twitter restored: What Ye said and why companies cut ties – Riley Gutiérrez McDermid Will Elon Musk fire more Twitter workers? Twitter’s previous management already planned to slash payroll by about $800 million and make deep cuts to infrastructure including data centers by the end of 2023.  Reports of more austere measures under Musk – including laying off 75% of the company’s 7,500 workers – circulated before the deal closed. Musk told workers at Twitter's headquarters on Wednesday ""that he doesn't plan to cut 75 percent of the staff when he takes over the company, according to people familiar with the matter,"" Bloomberg wrote. Twitter employees fret ahead of deal deadline: Musk reportedly wants 75% cut to Twitter workforce -- Jessica Guynn What did Elon Musk buy Twitter for? Musk wound up paying his original bid price: $54.20 a share, or roughly $44 billion.  At the time of his April offer, the amount represented a 33% premium to Twitter's stock price. But the company has since been caught up in a wider drop in tech stock prices, record-high inflation squeezing investors and increasing fears of a recession. Musk has been vocal about overpaying about the purchase, although Twitter had closed at $53.70 on Thursday, a marked upswing from its lowest point of $32.65 in July. ""Although obviously myself and other investors are overpaying for Twitter right now,"" Musk recently said, ""the long-term potential for Twitter is an order of magnitude higher than its current value."" – Riley Gutiérrez McDermid More: Elon Musk says Twitter can't become 'a free-for-all hellscape,' should be 'warm and welcoming' Why does Elon Musk want Twitter? The deal gives the Tesla billionaire control of one of the world’s most powerful megaphones.  It also gives Musk access to the data of nearly 400 million users and the ability to bring back people and organizations previously banned or sidelined by Twitter, including former President Donald Trump Who will run Twitter now? For now, it appears Musk is helming Twitter. On Wednesday he changed his Twitter bio to ""Chief Twit"" shortly before walking into Twitter's San Francisco headquarters carrying a porcelain sink, resurrecting a meme that has been internet lore for years. ""Let that sink in,"" he tweeted. – Jessica Guynn Twitter deal: Why 'Chief Twit' Elon Musk brought along a sink on his visit to Twitter headquarters Is Donald Trump coming back to Twitter? Now that Elon Musk is running Twitter, the Tesla billionaire is likely to reverse a permanent ban against Trump for inciting violence during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Musk has indicated he would allow Trump back on the social media platform where the former president had more than 88 million followers.  “Would be great to unwind permanent bans, except for spam accounts and those that explicitly advocate violence,” Musk texted Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal in April, according to court filings.  At a conference in May, Musk said: “I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump, I think that was a mistake.”  – Jessica Guynn Will Trump return? Is Donald Trump coming back to Twitter now that Elon Musk bought the company? Will Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter mean more hate, extremism online? When Elon Musk first agreed to buy Twitter in April, he said the social media site has the potential to become “the platform for free speech around the globe” and he would unlock it.  Musk, who closed the $44 billion deal after a months-long legal fight, has described himself as a “free speech absolutist” and expressed concern over the way Twitter moderates its users.  Now that Musk owns Twitter, will he make good on his promise to loosen content moderation rules in the name of “free speech?”  Musk said Thursday he doesn’t want the site to become “a free-for-all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences” in a message to advertisers, who analysts have said may be scared off by the Tesla CEO’s stance on free speech.  Extremists cheer Musk Twitter deal: Oath Keepers trial heats up & more LGBTQ harassment “In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all, where you can choose your desired experience according to your preferences,” Musk said in a note posted on Twitter.  Critics have expressed concern that Musk would allow harmful or extremist speech on the site and experts have warned that loosening content moderation could cause real-world harm.  Conservatives, meanwhile, have celebrated Musk's Twitter takeover, as many accuse social media platforms of routinely censoring their voices, feelings further fueled earlier this year after former President Donald Trump was permanently banned from Twitter. Musk has indicated he would let Trump, who was banned for inciting violence during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, back on the site.  – Amanda Pérez Pintado Things getting nasty on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram? How to shut down the hate, harassment How will advertisers respond to a Twitter with less moderation? Elon Musk, a self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist,” has been advocating for less content moderation on Twitter since his plans to take over the company were first announced in April.  ""We want to have the perception and the reality that speech is as free as possible,"" Musk said in April at the TED2022 conference. ""Is someone you don't like allowed to say something you don't like? And if that is the case, then we have free speech.” The idea seems to harken back to the early days of Twitter; former CEO Dick Costolo called the site the “free-speech wing of the free-speech party” in the early 2010s.  Since then, Twitter has adopted stricter policies to combat disinformation, misinformation and hate speech. The platform’s rules prohibit targeted harassment, COVID-19 misinformation and election manipulation.  A different Twitter Elon Musk says Twitter can't become 'a free-for-all hellscape,' should be 'warm and welcoming' Musk’s talk about softening some of Twitter’s rules to any speech has raised red flags for advertisers. Shortly after the Wall Street Journal released a report about Madison Avenue’s concerns, Musk issued a statement on Twitter saying the social media platform ""obviously cannot become a free-for-all-hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences.” Musk’s tweet was addressed to advertisers, the company’s primary source of revenue. “Social networks are trying to do a better job removing hateful content, content that is antisemitic, content that’s blatantly misinformation,” said Ari Lightman, professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University. “That’s something that advertisers worry about.” – Bailey Schulz This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: 'Freed' bird: Day 1 of Elon Musk's Twitter and the social media platform's path forward"
403,28-Oct-22,The Washington Post,"Musk cements his takeover of Twitter, sacks top executives",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2729292136/BFD812D457A14912PQ/508?accountid=13946,"SAN FRANCISCO - Elon Musk became Twitter's owner late Thursday as his $44 billion deal to take over the company officially closed, marking a new era for one of the world's most influential social media platforms.
As one of his first moves, he fired several top Twitter executives, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. One of those confirmed the deal was complete.
Chief executive Parag Agrawal, chief financial officer Ned Segal, and Vijaya Gadde, head of legal policy, trust and safety, were let go, according to the people. Sean Edgett, the company's general counsel, was also pushed out, one of the people said. The top executives were hastily booted from the company's San Francisco headquarters.
Musk's moves late Thursday signal his intentions to firmly put his stamp on one of the world's most influential social media companies. Musk has publicly criticized Twitter's outgoing management over product decisions and content moderation, as well as saying he would restore former president Donald Trump's account.
Still, ""Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!"" Musk tweeted Thursday.
The closure of the deal ended a months-long roller coaster saga in which the billionaire - the world's richest person - conducted a hostile takeover to buy the company at an inflated price, only to renege on the deal and then enter into a bitter legal battle with the social network.
But in recent days, Musk appeared resigned, and even enthusiastic, about his impending ownership. He showed up at the company's offices unexpectedly on Wednesday, carrying a sink to suggest that the message that he would become owner needed to ""sink in,"" according to a photo he posted to his more than 100 million Twitter followers.
He also plans to hold a companywide town hall on Friday.
Neither Twitter nor the executives responded immediately to a request for comment.
The moves place the heralded entrepreneur at the helm of one of the world's most powerful communication platforms just days ahead of major elections in the United States and Brazil.
Musk, a transportation magnate who is also CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has offered some clues about what he would do when he took over Twitter - despite having no experience running a social media service.
He has suggested that he wants to loosen standards for the policing of harmful content such as misinformation and hate speech. He has also decried so-called censorship by social media companies.
He has repeatedly criticized the company and supported online attacks against individual executives. He has told potential investors and partners that he wants to execute a financial turnaround of the company by firing nearly 75 percent of the workforce and leaning into new business opportunities, including having people subscribe to exclusive content from popular influencers.
Musk represents a different kind of owner of a social media company than Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey, or his now-rival Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who generally try to stay politically neutral.
Over the course of his Twitter bid, he has at times styled himself a moderate, but he also announced plans to vote for a Republican president in 2024. He has also weighed in on geopolitical conflicts between China and Taiwan and on the Ukraine war.
Inside Twitter, Musk's arrival has been met with resentment and dismay - though Musk's visit on Wednesday left some hopeful. Those hopes were quickly dashed with the firings of longtime top executives, who had commanded the trust of existing staff.
The mood after Wednesday's visit was ""overall slightly more positive,"" said one employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the company, adding ""everyone's ready to close this chapter and get to what comes next.""
Musk's interest in owning Twitter became public in early April, when financial filings revealed he had taken a more than 9 percent stake in the company, making him its largest individual shareholder. A day later, Musk was announced as Twitter's newest board appointee.
But his relationship with top executives quickly went south. Agrawal took exception to Musk's April 9 tweet that asked ""Is Twitter dying?"" according to text message exchanges revealed in court documents. Musk laid out his plan in subsequent messages.
""I'm not joining the board,"" he said in one. ""This is a waste of time.""
Instead, he decided to take Twitter private and went to the board with an ultimatum: Let him buy the company or he would start a rival social media service. He publicly launched a hostile takeover bid, pricing the deal at $54.20 - a possible wink to cannabis, raising some doubts about his sincerity.
Roughly two weeks later, Musk and Twitter struck a deal. In an onstage interview, Musk discussed his plans.
""Well I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena free speech,"" Musk said, echoing statements he has made over the past couple weeks. ""Twitter has become kind of the de facto town square, so it's just really important that people have the, both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law.""
But Twitter's board - while angry at Musk's tactics - was ultimately eager for the deal.
Twitter executives were predicting internally that the company would be far off track from meeting revenue targets in 2022, according to documents obtained by The Washington Post, as well as people familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe proceedings.
Twitter's board was planning to make ""drastic"" cuts to staff and other services, including cutting roughly a quarter of the budget for third party contractors who moderate content for the company, major cuts to infrastructure and data centers, and firing thousands of people to shave at least $700 million off labor costs, according to the interviews and documents. One of the leaders who signed off on the layoff notices was Edgett, who was fired Thursday.
Executives also believed that the company would not have easily found other buyers, according to one of the people.
Musk announced his acquisition three days before those layoffs were set to be announced.
Musk planned to buy the company with a combination of debt financing and collateral of his own personal wealth, much of which is generated by his stake in Tesla. But the stock market started to collapse, affecting Tesla's stock prices and Musk's overall wealth.
Musk started tweeting about Twitter's tabulation of spam and bots, which he argued understated the true proportion of nonhuman accounts on the site.
He declared the deal ""on hold"" in an early morning tweet May 13. By early July, Musk backed out of the deal completely.
Twitter sued him days later alleging breach of contract, sending the matter to the Delaware Court of Chancery. Musk's chances were broadly viewed as grim, but Musk's legal team latched onto a new strategy after The Post uncovered a whistleblower complaint that included explosive claims about Twitter's business.
Musk shifted his opinion on whether to buy the company after a series of losses in matters related to scheduling and discovery, according to people close to Musk and his team who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive matters. A loss became a serious possibility if the matter went to trial, risking penalties beyond merely the buying cost. 
Musk also took solace in his debt and equity commitments, which locked him into the deal on favorable terms that might not be otherwise available, the people said. And he became excited by his plans for the site.
Earlier this month, the Delaware judge overseeing the case agreed to let Twitter and Musk resolve their dispute by Friday or it would go trial.
The deal ultimately closed a day before the deadline.

404,28-Oct-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Welcome to Elon Musk's Twitter Free Speech Zone; He might save Twitter, or he might not, but the reaction has been wild.",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2729675580/BFD812D457A14912PQ/608?accountid=13946,"Fixing Twitter might be Elon Musk's biggest challenge yet, and this is a guy who hopes to die on Mars. After a long, tempestuous takeover process, this week Mr. Musk closed the $44 billion deal, marched into Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco, and promptly cleared out the C-suite.
Users now await Mr. Musk's plans for the social site, which are hard to distill into 140 characters. A good first step would be to emphasize that dissenting views on political topics like Covid-19 or climate change won't be throttled as ""disinformation."" Mr. Musk could move the company to Texas, as he did for Tesla. Simply getting the site's employees out of the San Francisco bubble might help.
On the left, the reaction has been like something out of the Book of Revelation. ""The sun is dark,"" tweeted a journalism professor. A writer at the Verge argued: ""It turns out that most people do not want to participate in horrible unmoderated internet spaces full of s— racists."" The left dominates American media, but it sounds horrified that Mr. Musk might be politically ecumenical.
""It is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square,"" Mr. Musk wrote Thursday in a missive to advertisers. ""That said, Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences! In addition to adhering to the laws of the land, our platform must be warm and welcoming to all."" This does not sound like anything goes.
The elephant in the room is Donald Trump, who was permanently banned from Twitter after the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. Mr. Trump bears responsibility for what happened that day, but he's no longer President. Meantime, Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is freely tweeting that ""Zionists"" have ""always been a plague.""
Reinstating Mr. Trump to Twitter might not even help him politically, and it would be a constant headache for Republicans. The GOP does better when the focus is on President Biden. If Mr. Trump does decide to rejoin, no one will be happier than liberal journalists, who desperately want him to run for President again so they can revive their flagging readerships.
Another idea floated by Mr. Musk is to let Twitter users ""choose your desired experience according to your preferences, just as you can choose, for example, to see movies or play video games ranging from all ages to mature."" Would advertisers and regular users be comfortable on a G-rated site while knowing coarseness hides behind filters and settings?
Give Mr. Musk credit for working to find a free-market fix to complaints about the narrowing of online speech permitted by the tech platforms. Some Republicans are so fed up they think the government is a solution. Sen. Josh Hawley once proposed making big internet sites get a certificate from the Federal Trade Commission, proving their moderation policies are unbiased, whatever that might mean to the bureaucratic enforcers.
Good work too by the Delaware Chancery Court, which didn't let Mr. Musk wriggle out of the deal when he had second thoughts. There's a reason that Delaware is America's corporate capital. Mr. Musk overpaid for Twitter in the end, its debt load is considerable, and in the past decade it posted eight years of losses. That debt is another reason to think Mr. Musk will be responsive to what users actually want.
Twitter is expected to pay $1 billion a year in interest, up from about $50 million last year. It's hard to see how this is sustainable without cost cutting and, more important, revenue growth, perhaps by expanding into payments or peer-to-peer sales. ""Buying Twitter,"" he tweeted, ""is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app."" Will Mr. Musk save Twitter? Who knows. But it'll be fascinating to watch him try.

405,28-Oct-22,Republican & Herald,Elon Musk takes over Twitter but where will he go from here?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2729977634/BFD812D457A14912PQ/699?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has taken control of Twitter after a protracted legal battle and months of uncertainty. The question now is what the billionaire Tesla CEO will actually do with the social media platform.
Musk gave one indication of where he’s headed in a tweet Friday, saying no decisions on content or reinstating of accounts will be made until a “content moderation council” is put in place. The council, he wrote, would have diverse viewpoints.
Major personnel shakeups are widely expected, with Musk ousting several top Twitter executives on Thursday. A fourth confirmed his departure, in a tweet.
But Musk, the tech guru and self-proclaimed “Chief Twit,” has otherwise made contradictory statements about his vision for the company — and shared few concrete plans for how he will run it after buying it for $44 billion.
That has left Twitter’s users, advertisers and employees to parse his every move in an effort to guess where he might take the company. Many are looking to see if he will welcome back a number of influential conservative figures banned for violating Twitter’s rules — speculation that is only heightened by upcoming elections in Brazil, the U.S. and elsewhere.
“I will be digging in more today,” he tweeted early Friday, in response to a conservative political podcaster who has complained that the platform favors liberals and secretively downgrades conservative voices.
Former President Donald Trump, an avid tweeter before he was banned, said Friday he was “very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands” but promoted his own social media site, Truth Social, that he launched after being blocked from the more widely used platform.
Trump was banned two days after the Jan. 6 attacks for a pair of tweets that the company said continued to cast doubts on the legitimacy of the presidential election and raised risks for the presidential inauguration that Trump said he would not be attending.
Trump has repeatedly said that he will not return to Twitter even if his account is reinstated, though some allies wonder if he’ll be able to resist as he moves closer to announcing another expected presidential campaign. His Twitter account remained suspended Friday.
Meanwhile, conservative personalities on the site began recirculating long-debunked conspiracy theories, including about COVID-19 and the 2020 election, in a tongue-in-cheek attempt to “test” whether Twitter’s policies on misinformation were still being enforced.
The mercurial Musk has not made it easy to anticipate what he’ll do.
He has criticized Twitter’s dependence on advertisers, but made a statement Thursday that seemed aimed at soothing their fears. He has complained about restrictions on speech on the platform — but then vowed he wouldn’t let it become a “hellscape.” And for months, it wasn’t even clear if he wanted to control the company at all.
After Musk signed a deal to acquire Twitter in April, he tried to back out of it, leading the company to sue him to force him to go through with the acquisition. A Delaware judge had ordered that the deal be finalized by Friday.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives estimated that Musk and his investors overpaid. Even Musk has said the $44 billion price tag for Twitter was too high but that the company had great potential.
The payment “will go down as one of the most overpaid tech acquisitions in the history of M&A deals on the Street, in our opinion,” Ives wrote in a note to investors. “With fair value that we would peg at roughly $25 billion, Musk buying Twitter remains a major head scratcher that ultimately he could not get out of once the Delaware Courts got involved.”

After months of uncertainty, a series of moves by Musk this week signaled that the deal would in fact go through.
On Wednesday, he strolled into the company’s San Francisco headquarters carrying a porcelain sink and tweeted “Entering Twitter HQ — let that sink in!” Then on Thursday, he tweeted, “the bird is freed,” a reference to Twitter’s logo.
The same day, Musk fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal and Chief Legal Counsel Vijaya Gadde. Sean Edgett, who had been Twitter’s general counsel, confirmed on Twitter Friday that he’s also out of a job, posting that the company is full of the most amazing people. “Keep taking good care of this place, Tweagle,” he added, referring to the company name for Twitter’s legal department. Gadde, meanwhile, removed all references to her former employer from her Twitter bio, while trolls continued to post thousands abusive messages in replies to her most recent tweet.
As concerns rise about the direction of Twitter’s content moderation, European Union Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton tweeted to Musk on Friday that “In Europe, the bird will fly by our rules.”
Breton and Musk met in May and appeared in a video together in which Musk said he agreed with the 27-nation bloc’s strict new online regulations. Its Digital Services Act threatens big tech companies with billions in fines if they don’t police platforms more strictly for illegal or harmful content such as hate speech and disinformation.
Musk has also spent months deriding Twitter’s “spam bots” and making sometimes conflicting pronouncements about Twitter’s problems and how to fix them.
He posted a note Thursday aimed at addressing concerns that his plans to promote free speech by cutting back on moderating content will open the floodgates to more online toxicity and drive away users. It showed a newfound emphasis on ad revenue, especially a need for Twitter to provide more “relevant ads” — which typically means targeted ads that rely on collecting and analyzing users’ personal information.
About 90% of Twitter’s revenue comes from advertising, but it’s far from being the biggest digital marketing platform. Google, Amazon and Meta account for about 75% of digital ads. Twitter was just 1% of global digital ad spending in 2022, according to an Insider Intelligence projection.
Lou Paskalis, former head of media for Bank of America, said Twitter’s most loyal advertisers, many Fortune 100 companies, believe in the platform and probably won’t leave unless “some really untoward things” happen.
The takeover means Twitter is becoming a private company. Trading of its shares was suspended Friday, and they will be pulled from the New York Stock Exchange next month.

406,29-Oct-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",It's All Musk's And All Changing: [Correction],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2729777549/BFD812D457A14912PQ/307?accountid=13946,"The social media company went public in 2013. But Elon Musk is taking it private as part of his acquisition of the firm. Here's what that means.Elon Musk closes his purchase of Twitter and fires several top executives. Follow for the latest news updates .SAN FRANCISCO -- In August 2018, Elon Musk called Michael Dell for advice.Mr. Musk, who was trying to take Tesla, his electric car company, private, quizzed Mr. Dell, who had done that very thing with his eponymous computer company in 2013, about the process and the best lawyers to use for the complicated transaction.""I was really asking him about -- did he find being private was good?"" Mr. Musk recalled in a deposition about the Tesla effort. ""Did he regret going private?""Mr. Dell warned Mr. Musk that it was ""a very difficult process"" but that he was glad to have done it, according to court filings.Now, Mr. Musk, who did not end up taking Tesla private, is doing so with Twitter. As part of his $44 billion acquisition of the social media service, which closed on Thursday, he is delisting the company's stock and taking it out of the hands of public shareholders.Making Twitter a private company gives Mr. Musk some advantages. Unlike publicly traded companies, privately held firms do not have to make quarterly public disclosures about their performance. They are also subject to less regulatory scrutiny and can be more tightly controlled by an owner. That means Mr. Musk can make over Twitter -- including tweaking the platform's content rules, its finances and its priorities -- without having to consider the worries of the investing public.""It's hard to run a public company if you think you should be the one running it and you're not open to other views from people, like stockholders,"" said Brian J.M. Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School. ""By taking it private, you feel like you have a lot more flexibility.""Here's how Twitter is set to change as a private company under Mr. Musk.How is Mr. Musk taking Twitter private?As part of buying Twitter, Mr. Musk is merging the social media company with X Holdings, a corporate entity that he established in Delaware to handle the deal. X is buying out all of Twitter's stock and will control the service, and Mr. Musk will control the holding company.What happens to Twitter's stock?Twitter will be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and its shares will no longer trade on public markets as of Nov. 8, according to a securities filing. In September, Twitter's shareholders approved the company's sale to Mr. Musk and agreed to sell their stock to him for $54.20 a share. Investors will be able to claim the cash value of their shares.What happens to Twitter's board of directors?With the deal's completion, Twitter's board of directors will dissolve and its nine members will no longer preside over the company's operations. Mr. Musk will most likely appoint a new board made up of friends and investors who helped fund the acquisition. The new board will be responsible for plotting Twitter's trajectory as a private company.""It will still be required by law to have a board of directors, and that would probably include Elon Musk and some of the other big equity investors in the company,"" said Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School. ""I expect Mr. Musk will run it as a somewhat friendly dictatorship.""What happens to Twitter's top executives?Mr. Musk has already started cleaning house, with several of Twitter's top executives getting fired on Thursday.The executives who were fired include Parag Agrawal, Twitter's chief executive, who has clashed publicly and privately with Mr. Musk. When Mr. Musk complained this year that Twitter had an unchecked spam problem, Mr. Agrawal tweeted to rebut his claims. Mr. Musk responded with a poop emoji.At another point, Mr. Agrawal texted Mr. Musk, telling the billionaire that his criticisms were harming Twitter, according to a court filing.""This is a waste of time,"" Mr. Musk retorted.Other executives who were fired include Ned Segal, Twitter's chief financial officer; Vijaya Gadde, the top legal and policy executive; and Sean Edgett, the general counsel.Under the merger agreement, Mr. Agrawal was potentially set to receive a golden parachute worth about $60 million, with Mr. Segal to receive $46 million, while Ms. Gadde would receive about $20 million. It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Musk intended to make the payments.What about Twitter's employees?Twitter has about 7,500 employees. Some of them have been jittery for months about the company's sale to Mr. Musk. Many could face layoffs or job changes as their new owner takes over.Their compensation is also set to change. Employees typically receive stock options in the company. But, with the delisting of Twitter's stock, employees are set to be cashed out for shares they already have and to be paid with cash bonuses going forward, instead of the stock options they were scheduled to receive, according to the merger agreement. Some employees have worried that Mr. Musk may not honor the agreement.""Most of these employees have been in a public company and are used to public option grants, which are liquid,"" Mr. Quinn said. ""They will have to come up with some other Silicon Valley-friendly method of keeping people around.""What financial pressures will Twitter face as a private company?By going private, Twitter will avoid some public scrutiny since it will no longer be required to make quarterly disclosures about the health of its business. This will give Mr. Musk some flexibility as he changes Twitter.But he will face pressure from the banks that lent him $12.5 billion for the deal to begin repaying his debt. The cost of repaying those loans could run as high as $1 billion a year, financial analysts said.""He has less public pressure, but he has a lot of private pressure from the banks to make the payments,"" Mr. Quinn said of Mr. Musk. ""Like almost every other private-equity take-private, he's going to need a manager who is very focused on operations, being lean and being able to pay the bills on a day-to-day basis.""Mr. Musk also took about $7.1 billion from equity investors to push the deal through. He may also face pressure from those investors, who might expect him to take Twitter public again at some point so that they can recoup their investment.In some take-private deals, owners have opted to sell branches of their companies to pay their debts. Mr. Musk could choose to do the same at Twitter.""It's conceivable that some aspects of Twitter could potentially be carved off, sold off or spun off to raise money that could go toward paying the debt,"" Mr. Talley said. ""Twitter kind of is pared down to its core mission right now. They would have to get a little creative.""PhotographTwitter's logo at the New York Stock Exchange during the company's initial public offering in 2013. Elon Musk will buy out Twitter stock, which will be delisted as of Nov. 8, via X Holdings, and then he will control the holding company. Twitter will then not have to face shareholders anymore.

The danger here is not that we have a rogue billionaire in our midst -- that has happened before, and it will happen again -- but that this one will be in control of what he has rightly referred to as our ""digital town square.""Mr. Musk is the face of 21st-century tech-based, extreme capitalism, just as the robber barons, who built our railroads, and Andrew Carnegie, who supplied those railroads and the builders of modern American cities with steel, embodied the exuberant and expansive industrial capitalism of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Mr. Musk has exploited the opportunities emerging in a rapidly disintegrating regulatory state apparatus and acquired a small army of investors and a fleet of lobbyists, lawyers and fanboys (known as Musketeers). He has sought to position himself as a tech genius who can break the rules, exploit and excise those who work for him, ridicule those who stand in his way and do as he wishes with his wealth because it benefits humanity. He'll rescue the planet with his electric cars and save Ukraine with his satellite systems -- but he must be freed of government interference to do these good deeds.For more than two centuries, American moguls like Mr. Musk have transformed our economy and our daily lives (and enriched themselves) by playing a winning game with governments. They sought and received from those governments enormous subsidies and protection, while demanding that they be left alone to conduct their business as they pleased. The railroad robber barons built their fortunes on government-supplied land on which they laid their tracks and then collected government subsidies for every mile of it.Carnegie and the steel barons elected Republican lawmakers and presidents committed to protecting their companies' profits by levying high tariffs on foreign competitors. Mr. Musk's companies, and his fortune, were built with billions of dollars' worth of subsidies for his electric-car company, Tesla, and billions more in NASA contracts to ferry American astronauts into space, launch satellites and provide high-speed internet services tethered to his fleet of some 3,000 satellites.What makes Mr. Musk particularly powerful and potentially more dangerous than the industrial-era moguls is his ability to promote his businesses and political notions with a tweet. The effect of such instant communications is enhanced by his firm understanding of media and market dynamics in this era of meme stocks, day trading, instant communications, misinformation and disinformation.Carnegie kept his companies private because he did not want to be beholden to outside investors, influence and market conditions. Mr. Musk has done the opposite. His wealth is based not on factories he has built, products he sells or real estate he has acquired, but on the billions of dollars of shares he owns in Tesla, SpaceX, cryptocurrency companies and Twitter.In August 2018, he tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share. The Securities and Exchange Commission said Mr. Musk's ""misleading tweets"" caused Tesla's stock price to jump by over 6 percent and slapped him with a securities fraud charge. He then agreed to step down as Tesla's chairman and to pay a $20 million penalty. Tesla paid another $20 million.The Kennedy family patriarch, Joseph P. Kennedy, was always adept at manipulating stock prices, but as the first chairman of the S.E.C., he feared that capitalism would never recover from the Great Depression if manipulators and fraudsters were free to do as they pleased. Under Kennedy, the commission outlawed many of the practices that he had exploited to make his fortune, including short selling on insider information.Mr. Musk has no such fears and no such scruples. As The Economist noted in April, Mr. Musk ""promotes the idea that the normal rules of investment do not apply. He paints stewards of fair play -- regulators and boards -- as pettifogging enemies of progress."" He refers to S.E.C. officials as ""those bastards.""The likely consequences of Mr. Musk's Twitter ownership will be political as well as economic disruption. By declaring that he intends to allow Donald Trump back on the site, he has signaled his opposition to policing it for political disinformation and misinformation. He has identified himself as a ""free speech absolutist"" and has repeated several times that he opposes and will limit censorship and will likely loosen content moderation rules.It is not unreasonable to expect that a Musk-owned and controlled Twitter will, in the name of free speech, allow disinformation and misinformation to be tweeted ad infinitum so long as it discredits his political opponents and celebrates and enriches himself and his allies.Mr. Musk is correct that ""free speech"" must be honored and protected. But is it not time that we, as a people and a nation, engage in a wide-ranging, inclusive public debate on when and how free speech creates ""a clear and present danger"" -- as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote a century ago -- and whether we need government to find a way, through law or regulation or persuasion, to prevent this from happening?Elon Musk is a product of his -- and our -- times. Rather than debate or deride his influence, we must recognize that he is not the self-made genius businessman he plays in the media. Instead, his success was prompted and paid for by taxpayer money and abetted by government officials who have allowed him and other billionaire businessmen to exercise more and more control over our economy and our politics.David Nasaw is an emeritus professor of history at the CUNY Graduate Center and the author, most recently, of ""The Last Million: Europe's Displaced Persons from World War to Cold War.""The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

PHOTO: Laura Morton for The Wall Street Journal
With his six-month takeover saga behind him, Elon Musk now takes on the work of righting Twitter Inc.'s ship in what is shaping up as the most tempestuous business environment for social media in the industry's history.
In just the past 10 days, as Mr. Musk's $44 billion bid careened to the finish , the landscape turned increasingly challenging.
Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., Snapchat parent Snap Inc. and Alphabet Inc., which owns Google and its video platform YouTube, saw their stock prices get pummeled after delivering a drumbeat of troubling data points .
YouTube posted its first-ever decline in advertising revenue, while Snap warned investors that it is operating on an assumption of no revenue growth this quarter from the year-ago period.
 Timeline: How the Deal Happened 
Musk acquired Twitter after a monthslong legal fight. Some key moments. 
Meta, meanwhile, spooked investors with a revenue slowdown and a commitment to spending tens of billions more toward the building of the metaverse , which has yet to attract a significant user base. Meta's market value dropped below $300 billion for the first time since early 2016.
Twitter shares some of the same challenges as its rivals, including a tough macroeconomic climate aggravated by inflation and the war in Ukraine , growing competition from rival TikTok and fallout from Apple Inc.'s ad-tracking changes .
Twitter has unique issues to face too, including potentially losing advertisers uncomfortable with Mr. Musk's vision. While he has said he wants to bolster the company's nascent subscription business and rely less on advertising, the latter makes up roughly 90% of Twitter's revenue. In July, Twitter said uncertainty around the deal contributed to a surprise decline in revenue .
Some advertisers have expressed concern that Mr. Musk's stated commitment to free speech will lead to a surge of content that is offensive to some users or at least not advertiser-friendly.
""Twitter's ad business is already on shaky ground,"" said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, a market-research firm. In coming days, she said, Mr. Musk will need to ""set clear guidelines for what content moderation will look like if he wants to keep advertisers around.""
On Thursday, the eve of the deal closing, Mr. Musk took steps to assure Madison Avenue, publishing a letter saying that he very much believed ""that advertising, when done right, can delight, entertain and inform you.""
""Fundamentally, Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise,"" Mr. Musk wrote. ""To everyone who has partnered with us, I thank you.""
On Friday, he further reassured advertisers that no major changes were coming imminently. Twitter would be ""forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints."" He added: ""No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.""
He has also said repeatedly that his vision for Twitter is a place that is not toxic, but rather fun. On Friday night, he tweeted, ""Comedy is now legal on Twitter.""
Among other things, Mr. Musk's charm offensive could be complicated by his many outside business interests. Late on Friday, General Motors Co. said it was pausing paid advertising on Twitter.
""We are engaging with Twitter to understand the direction of the platform,"" GM said.
GM is a close competitor with Tesla Inc., the electric-vehicle manufacturer where Mr. Musk is chief executive and that is responsible for the majority of his vast fortune.
Mr. Musk, who spent months trying to back out of the Twitter deal, is well aware of the challenges.
""Obviously, myself and the other investors are obviously overpaying for Twitter right now,"" Mr. Musk said on a Tesla earnings call earlier this month. He added, though, that ""the long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value.""
Twitter for years lagged behind its rivals in attracting users and generating revenue, and its executives repeatedly pledged to get faster at developing new features.
Mr. Musk's fans and investors point to his record as an innovator in a range of areas across the tech industry. In addition to Tesla, Mr. Musk was the CEO of the company that eventually became PayPal Holdings Inc., and he made more than $100 million when the company was sold to eBay Inc. for $1.4 billion in 2002. That year, Mr. Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, which is now valued at close to $100 billion.
""Elon has succeeded in many different industries,"" Roelof Botha, the head of Sequoia Capital, told The Wall Street Journal this week. His firm committed $800 million to Mr. Musk's deal . ""He's an incredible first-principles thinker,"" Mr. Botha said.
One thing possibly working in Mr. Musk's favor is that Twitter will become a private company as a result of the deal. This new status will afford Mr. Musk the ability to work on Twitter's challenges free from public-market investor scrutiny and sentiment.
""Let the good times roll,"" Mr. Musk tweeted Friday morning.

Twitter's newly minted owner, the self-described “free speech absolutist” Elon Musk, is about to get a crash course on global content moderation.
Among his first moves after completing his $44 billion takeover Thursday was to fire the social media platform's top executives, including the woman in charge of trust and safety at the platform, Vijaya Gadde.
He also posted a conciliatory note to wary advertisers, assuring them he won't allow Twitter to devolve into a “free-for-all hellscape.”
The problem is, not even the world's richest man can have it both ways.
Lightly moderated “free speech” sites such as Gab and Parler serve as cautionary tales of what can happen when the guardrails are lowered. These small, niche sites are popular with conservatives and libertarians fed up with what they see as censorship of their viewpoints on mainstream platforms like Facebook. They are also full of Nazi imagery, racist slurs and other extreme content, including calls to violence.
Some conservative personalities jumped on Twitter Friday after Musk's takeover to recirculate long-debunked conspiracy theories in an apparent attempt to see if the site's policies on misinformation were still being enforced.
Advertisers don't want to promote their products next to disturbing, racist and hateful posts — and most people don't want to spend time on chaotic online spaces where they are barraged by racist and sexist trolls.
On Friday, GM announced it would be pausing advertising on Twitter while it figures out the direction of the platform under Musk. But Lou Paskalis, former head of media for Bank of America, said Twitter’s most loyal advertisers, many Fortune 100 companies, believe in the platform and probably won’t leave unless “some really untoward things” happen.
But it's not just ads and jokes that are at stake.
Eddie Perez, a former Twitter civic integrity team leader, said Musk seems to consider Twitter a digital public square where everyone has equal voice. It’s a “quaint idea of the modern-day version of the town square,” Perez said.
But that’s not how the major social media platforms work. They have instead become powerful tools of asymmetric warfare, and many of their users don’t realize they are being manipulated with disinformation by nation states and bad domestic actors — many with significant resources.
“The danger here is that in the name of ‘free speech,’ Musk will turn back the clock and make Twitter into a more potent engine of hatred, divisiveness, and misinformation about elections, public health policy, and international affairs,” said Paul Barrett, deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights.
Though he'd been expected to reinstate banned accounts — ranging from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene — Musk said on Friday that no decisions on content or reinstatements will be made until a “content moderation council” is put in place. The council, he wrote, would have “diverse viewpoints,"" but he gave no further details.
Musk may be starting from scratch, but Twitter has spent years building up its content moderation system, which is still far from perfect. As such, experts have expressed grave concern's about Musk's efforts — after all, the Tesla CEO has little experience navigating the temperamental and geopolitical world of social media, even if he is a constant and wildly popular user of the site he just bought.
“I am most concerned about Musk’s decision to summarily fire Vijaya Gadde, Twitter’s head of legal policy, trust, and safety — a senior executive who was trying, however imperfectly, to keep the platform from spreading even more harmful content than it does,” Barrett said.
Many are looking to see if he will welcome back a number of influential conservative figures banned for violating Twitter’s rules — speculation that is only heightened by upcoming elections in Brazil, the U.S. and elsewhere.
“I will be digging in more today,” Musk tweeted early Friday, in response to a conservative political podcaster who has complained that the platform favors liberals and secretively downgrades conservative voices.
Former President Donald Trump, an avid tweeter before he was banned, said Friday he was “very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands” but promoted his own social media site, Truth Social, that he launched after being blocked from the more widely used platform.
Trump was banned two days after the Jan. 6 attacks for a pair of tweets that the company said continued to cast doubts on the legitimacy of the presidential election and raised risks for the presidential inauguration that Trump said he would not be attending.
Another task for Musk: delivering on his promise to clean up the fake profiles, or “spam bots” that have preoccupied him and bedeviled Twitter since long before he expressed interest in acquiring it.
The bot count matters because advertisers — Twitter’s chief revenue source — want to know roughly how many real humans they are reaching when they buy ads. It’s also important in the effort to stop bad actors from amassing an army of accounts to amplify misinformation or harass political adversaries.

410,29-Oct-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",EXCHANGE --- Business News: Tech Moguls' Fortunes Have Taken a Big Hit,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2729783225/BFD812D457A14912PQ/571?accountid=13946,"The 20 richest tech billionaires have collectively lost nearly half a trillion dollars this year amid the stock market's sharp tumble, a loss of wealth that is more than the market values of all but seven companies in the S&P 500.
The world's richest tech moguls -- including Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Larry Ellison -- have seen more than $480 billion in paper wealth disappear this year through Thursday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a daily ranking of the richest people in the world. Disappointing earnings reports from a slew of tech giants this past week have stoked recession fears, pushed stock prices lower and weighed on the fortunes of the world's wealthiest people.
Mr. Zuckerberg's net worth fell by $11.2 billion alone on Thursday, according to the ranking. Shares of his company, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., lost a quarter of their value after a disappointing earnings report spooked investors.
So far this year, the wealth of Meta's chief executive has fallen by more than $87 billion. That leaves him with a current net worth of $37.7 billion, good for the 28th richest person in the world, according to the index. By comparison, he was among the top 10 earlier this year.
Tech companies, which enjoyed strong growth in the beginning of the pandemic, are now feeling pain. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has fallen by 29% through Friday's close.
For many executives and founders, their net worth is at least partially tied up in shares of their businesses. That means big swings in their companies' stock prices can have profound impacts.
Elon Musk, the world's richest person, and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com Inc., have each seen more than $58 billion in wealth wiped away this year. Both entrepreneurs have jockeyed in the past for the bragging rights of being the world's richest person before Mr. Musk pulled away with a sizable lead.
Mr. Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc., also runs rocket company SpaceX. He founded Boring Co., an underground tunnel business, as well as neuroscience startup Neuralink Corp. And this week, he completed his on-again, off-again takeover of Twitter Inc. Mr. Musk is currently worth $212 billion.
The wealth of Mr. Bezos, meanwhile, is valued at $134 billion. Amazon's shares fell 6.8% on Friday as Wall Street was disappointed with the company's sales forecast for the current quarter.
Google parent Alphabet Inc. co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who are among the 10 richest people in the world, have also seen their net worth dented. They have each lost more than $40 billion in paper wealth this year, with both taking a hit this past week after Alphabet reported its first-ever drop in YouTube year-over-year ad sales.

411,29-Oct-22,Telegraph - Herald,'Chief Twit' Musk takes control of Twitter,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2731898464/BFD812D457A14912PQ/690?accountid=13946,"The Associated Press
Elon Musk has taken control of Twitter after a protracted legal battle and months of uncertainty. The question now is what the billionaire Tesla CEO will actually do with the social media platform.
Musk gave one indication of where he's headed in a tweet Friday, saying no decisions on content or reinstating of accounts will be made until a ""content moderation council"" is put in place. The council, he wrote, would have diverse viewpoints.
Major personnel shakeups are widely expected, with Musk ousting several top Twitter executives on Thursday. A fourth confirmed his departure, in a tweet.
But Musk, the tech guru and self-proclaimed ""Chief Twit,"" has otherwise made contradictory statements about his vision for the company - and shared few concrete plans for how he will run it after buying it for $44 billion.
That has left Twitter's users, advertisers and employees to parse his every move in an effort to guess where he might take the company. Many are looking to see if he will welcome back a number of influential conservative figures banned for violating Twitter's rules - speculation that is only heightened by upcoming elections in Brazil, the U.S. and elsewhere.
""I will be digging in more today,"" he tweeted early Friday, in response to a conservative political podcaster who has complained that the platform favors liberals and secretively downgrades conservative voices.
Former President Donald Trump, an avid tweeter before he was banned, said Friday he was ""very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands"" but promoted his own social media site, Truth Social, that he launched after being blocked from the more widely used platform.
Trump was banned two days after the Jan. 6 attacks for a pair of tweets that the company said continued to cast doubts on the legitimacy of the presidential election and raised risks for the presidential inauguration that Trump said he would not be attending.
Trump has repeatedly said that he will not return to Twitter even if his account is reinstated, though some allies wonder if he'll be able to resist as he moves closer to announcing another expected presidential campaign. His Twitter account remained suspended Friday.
Meanwhile, conservative personalities on the site began recirculating previously banned theories, including about COVID-19 and the 2020 election, in a tongue-in-cheek attempt to ""test"" whether Twitter's policy of censoring what it deemed to be misinformation was still being enforced.
The mercurial Musk has not made it easy to anticipate what he'll do.
He has criticized Twitter's dependence on advertisers, but made a statement Thursday that seemed aimed at soothing their fears. He has complained about restrictions on speech on the platform - but then vowed he wouldn't let it become a ""hellscape."" And for months it wasn't even clear if he wanted to control the company at all.
After Musk signed a deal to acquire Twitter in April, he tried to back out of it, leading the company to sue him to force him to go through with the acquisition. A Delaware judge had ordered that the deal be finalized by Friday.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives estimated that Musk and his investors overpaid. Even Musk has said the $44 billion price tag for Twitter was too high but that the company had great potential.
The payment ""will go down as one of the most overpaid tech acquisitions in the history of M&A deals on the Street, in our opinion,"" Ives wrote in a note to investors. ""With fair value that we would peg at roughly $25 billion, Musk buying Twitter remains a major head scratcher that ultimately he could not get out of once the Delaware Courts got involved.""
After months of uncertainty, a series of moves by Musk this week signaled that the deal would in fact go through.
On Wednesday, he strolled into the company's San Francisco headquarters carrying a porcelain sink and tweeted ""Entering Twitter HQ - let that sink in!"" Then on Thursday, he tweeted, ""the bird is freed,"" a reference to Twitter's logo.
The same day, Musk fired CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal and Chief Legal Counsel Vijaya Gadde. Sean Edgett, who had been Twitter's general counsel, confirmed on Twitter Friday that he's also out of a job, posting that the company is full of the most amazing people. ""Keep taking good care of this place, Tweagle,"" he added, referring to the company name for Twitter's legal department. Gadde, meanwhile, removed all references to her former employer from her Twitter bio, while trolls continued to post thousands abusive messages in replies to her most recent tweet.
As concerns rise about the direction of Twitter's content moderation, European Union Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton tweeted to Musk on Friday that ""In Europe, the bird will fly by our rules.""
Breton and Musk met in May and appeared in a video together in which Musk said he agreed with the 27-nation bloc's strict new online regulations. Its Digital Services Act threatens big tech companies with billions in fines if they don't police platforms more strictly for illegal or harmful content such as hate speech and disinformation.
Musk has also spent months deriding Twitter's ""spam bots"" and making sometimes conflicting pronouncements about Twitter's problems and how to fix them.
He posted a note Thursday aimed at addressing concerns that his plans to promote free speech by cutting back on moderating content will open the floodgates to more online toxicity and drive away users. It showed a newfound emphasis on ad revenue, especially a need for Twitter to provide more ""relevant ads"" - which typically means targeted ads that rely on collecting and analyzing users' personal information.
About 90% of Twitter's revenue comes from advertising, but it's far from being the biggest digital marketing platform. Google, Amazon and Meta account for about 75% of digital ads. Twitter was just 1% of global digital ad spending in 2022, according to an Insider Intelligence projection.
Lou Paskalis, former head of media for Bank of America, said Twitter's most loyal advertisers, many Fortune 100 companies, believe in the platform and probably won't leave unless ""some really untoward things"" happen. On Friday, General Motors announced that it had temporarily paused its Twitter advertising while it works to ""understand the direction of the platform"" under Musk's ownership. GM described the pause as a normal step it takes when a media platform undergoes ""significant change.""
The takeover means Twitter is becoming a private company. Trading of its shares was suspended Friday, and they will be pulled from the New York Stock Exchange next month.

PHOTO: Laura Morton for The Wall Street Journal
With his six-month takeover saga behind him, Elon Musk now takes on the work of righting Twitter Inc.'s ship in what is shaping up as the most tempestuous business environment for social media in the industry's history.
In just the past 10 days, as Mr. Musk's $44 billion bid careened to the finish , the landscape turned increasingly challenging.
Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., Snapchat parent Snap Inc. and Alphabet Inc., which owns Google and its video platform YouTube, saw their stock prices get pummeled after delivering a drumbeat of troubling data points .
 Timeline: How the Deal Happened 
Musk acquired Twitter after a monthslong legal fight. Some key moments. 
YouTube posted its first decline in advertising revenue , while Snap warned investors that it is operating on an assumption of no revenue growth this quarter from a year earlier.
Meta spooked investors with a revenue slowdown and a commitment to spending tens of billions more toward the building of the metaverse , which has yet to attract a significant user base. Meta's market value dropped below $300 billion for the first time since early 2016.
Twitter faces some of the same challenges as its rivals, including a tough macroeconomic climate aggravated by inflation and the war in Ukraine , growing competition from rival TikTok and fallout from Apple Inc.'s ad-tracking changes .
Twitter has unique issues to face too, including potentially losing advertisers uncomfortable with Mr. Musk's vision. While he has said he wants to bolster the company's nascent subscription business and rely less on advertising, the latter makes up roughly 90% of Twitter's revenue. In July, Twitter said uncertainty regarding the takeover deal contributed to a surprise decline in revenue .
Some advertisers have expressed concern that Mr. Musk's stated commitment to free speech will lead to a surge of content that is offensive to some users or at least not advertiser-friendly.
""Twitter's ad business is already on shaky ground,"" said Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at Insider Intelligence, a market-research firm. In coming days, she said, Mr. Musk will need to ""set clear guidelines for what content moderation will look like if he wants to keep advertisers around.""
On Thursday, Mr. Musk took steps to assure Madison Avenue, publishing a letter saying that he very much believed ""that advertising, when done right, can delight, entertain and inform you.""
""Fundamentally, Twitter aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise,"" Mr. Musk wrote. ""To everyone who has partnered with us, I thank you.""
On Friday, he told advertisers that no major changes were coming imminently. Twitter would be ""forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints."" He added: ""No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.""
He has also said repeatedly that his vision for Twitter is a place that isn't toxic, but rather fun. On Friday night, he tweeted, ""Comedy is now legal on Twitter.""
Among other things, Mr. Musk's charm offensive could be complicated by his many outside business interests. Late on Friday, General Motors Co. said it was pausing paid advertising on Twitter.
""We are engaging with Twitter to understand the direction of the platform,"" GM said.
GM is a close competitor with Tesla Inc., the electric-vehicle manufacturer where Mr. Musk is chief executive and that is responsible for the majority of his vast fortune.
Mr. Musk, who spent months trying to back out of the Twitter deal, is well aware of the challenges.
""Obviously, myself and the other investors are obviously overpaying for Twitter right now,"" Mr. Musk said on a Tesla earnings call this month. He added, though, that ""the long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is an order of magnitude greater than its current value.""
The challenge Mr. Musk faces in holding on to advertisers and moderating content became clear shortly after his takeover was complete. Several non-profits have in recent days pointed to a sudden rise in hate speech on the platform, including the Anti-Defamation League and the Network Contagion Research Institute.
The ADL, a Jewish advocacy group that examines anti-Semitism in the U.S., said it identified more than 1,200 tweets and retweets spreading anti-Semitic memes and called it a coordinated effort that followed Mr. Musk's takeover. The Network Contagion Research Institute, which studies online social threats, tweeted data Friday showing that the use of the N-word on Twitter jumped 500% in the previous 12 hours.
The National Basketball Association star LeBron James quoted the data Saturday, tweeting, ""I dont know Elon Musk and, tbh, I could care less who owns twitter. But I will say that if this is true, I hope he and his people take this very seriously because this is scary."" He added: ""So many damn unfit people saying hate speech is free speech .""
Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of safety and integrity, said Saturday that a small number of accounts were behind many of the tweets of slurs or hateful content, including 50,000 tweets of one racial slur from 300 accounts. The company is taking action to ban the users involved in the ""trolling campaign"" and will continue to work to address the issue, he said.
Twitter for years lagged behind its rivals in attracting users and generating revenue, and its executives repeatedly pledged to get faster at developing new features.
Mr. Musk's fans and investors point to his record as an innovator in a range of areas across the tech industry. In addition to Tesla, Mr. Musk was the chief executive of the company that eventually became PayPal Holdings Inc., and he made more than $100 million when the company was sold to eBay Inc. for $1.4 billion in 2002. That year, Mr. Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, which is now valued at close to $100 billion.
"" Elon has succeeded in many different industries,"" Roelof Botha, the head of Sequoia Capital, told The Wall Street Journal this past week. His firm committed $800 million to Mr. Musk's deal . ""He's an incredible first-principles thinker,"" Mr. Botha said.
One thing possibly working in Mr. Musk's favor is that Twitter will become a private company as a result of the deal. This new status will afford Mr. Musk the ability to work on Twitter's challenges free from public-market investor scrutiny and sentiment.
On Saturday, Mr. Musk fired away a series of tweets aimed at making carbs look cool. ""Fresh baked bread & pastries are some of the great joys of life,"" he wrote. ""Finally, the truth that carbs are amazing can be said on this platform! #FreeSpeech,"" he added.
On Sunday morning, he tweeted a link to an internet post speculatively calling into question what happened in the violent Friday morning attack on the husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ""There is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye,"" Mr. Musk tweeted. He later deleted the tweet.

414,31-Oct-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Musk's Big Test at Twitter: Making the Numbers Work: [Business/Financial Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2730212464/BFD812D457A14912PQ/619?accountid=13946,"Mr. Musk faces financial challenges in owning Twitter. The site frequently loses money and took on $13 billion in debt for the blockbuster deal.Now that Elon Musk has completed his $44 billion deal for Twitter, let's walk through the math of owning the social media company.It's not just an academic exercise. Mr. Musk's ability to make the numbers work will have a direct impact on the health of a service called the world's town square, determining what direction he takes the business and the platform. If the financial case is grim, any plans to invest in Twitter may have to take a back seat to simply paying the bills.The numbers are already daunting. The $44 billion acquisition was the largest leveraged buyout of a technology company in history. To do the deal, Mr. Musk, the world's richest man, loaded about $13 billion in debt on the company, which had not turned a profit for eight of the past 10 years. The deal was inked before the global economy looked to be headed toward a recession as interest rates surged higher. And digital advertising, which makes up 90 percent of Twitter's revenue, has been falling at social media companies.""Technology companies should be left with enough flexibility to pay for new research and development and new levels of innovation,"" said Drew Pascarella, a senior lecturer of finance at Cornell University who previously worked as a banker advising on acquisitions. This buyout ""completely eliminates flexibility.""Twitter and a representative for Mr. Musk did not respond to requests for comment.Last year, Twitter's interest expense was about $50 million. With the new debt taken on in the deal, that will now balloon to about $1 billion a year. Yet the company's operations last year generated about $630 million in cash flow to meet its financial obligations.That means that Twitter is generating less money per year than what it owes its lenders. The company also does not appear to have a lot of extra cash on hand. While it had about $6 billion in cash before Mr. Musk's buyout, a large portion of that probably went into the cost of closing the acquisition.That gives Mr. Musk little wiggle room, Mr. Pascarella said. ""They are essentially going to take all the financial resources of the company and just pour it into servicing the debt,"" he said.To make ends meet, Mr. Musk probably has to slash costs -- by a lot. Over the weekend, he was said to be already moving to do so by ordering job cuts across Twitter. One investor who put less than $1 million in the buyout of the company said he was told by the head of Mr. Musk's family office to expect that around 50 percent of Twitter's 7,500 employees would be laid off.Mr. Musk could target many areas of Twitter for layoffs. The company has about $1.2 billion in annual sales and marketing expenses, a large portion of which goes to employees' salaries, benefits and other compensation. But by cutting those costs, he risks getting rid of employees who have relationships with advertisers that would be hard to replace.Then there is the $1.2 billion that Twitter spends annually on research and development, which also goes mainly to employee compensation. Mr. Musk could cut jobs there, too. But he has said he has grand plans for the site, like combating fake accounts and creating new ways to manage content, which require people to develop those tools. The kinds of engineers Mr. Musk has said he wants to hire are expensive.There are other paths to slashing costs -- like money spent on rent, data centers and additional expenses, which collectively cost the company more than $1 billion a year but may be harder to quickly shed. Unlike traditional targets of leveraged buyouts, Twitter does not clearly have specific businesses to shed or downsize, like a struggling division.""This has always been the biggest challenge of this particular acquisition,"" said Eric Talley, a professor of corporate law at Columbia Law School. ""The last thing you want to do is sell off some integral part of what you need to run Twitter on a profitable basis. And then you've essentially tied your hands behind your back.""If even cost cuts do not help, Mr. Musk may need to raise more money from outside investors within a year, Mr. Talley said.Mr. Musk already has about $13 billion in debt from lenders, while other investors, like the venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, chipped in about $7.1 billion in cash. Mr. Musk was personally responsible for the buyout's remaining roughly $25 billion, and it remains unclear whether he gathered more investors to help lighten that load.If Twitter needs more money in a year, finding new investors could be a lot to ask given the economics of the company. Even Mr. Musk has conceded that his initial investors in the deal valuing Twitter at $44 billion were ""obviously overpaying."" The stocks of many social media companies have tumbled this year as they navigate the same problems as the rest of the economy.Given his net worth of more than $200 billion, Mr. Musk himself could theoretically help cover Twitter's extra cash needs. He could also try to buy out some of Twitter's lenders and reduce its debt load.But most of his wealth is tied up in shares of his electric vehicle company, Tesla, and its stock has plunged about 40 percent this year. At one point, Mr. Musk tried backing away from buying Twitter, and he may opt not to funnel more money into what would be at least his fifth company.Putting more money into a leveraged, slow-growth company like Twitter is also not the same as investing in a rapidly growing venture-backed start-up like his rocket-making company, SpaceX. The risks are greater at Twitter because the banks doing the lending care only about getting paid their interest on the day it is owed. Unlike, say, a real estate company, Twitter does not have a large amount of assets to offer lenders as collateral to keep them at bay.Still, billionaires have sought to prop up beleaguered deals before. The hedge fund manager Eddie Lampert sought to rethink the retail industry and spent billions of his own fortune keeping Sears alive after its failed merger with Kmart in the 2000s. Sears filed for bankruptcy in 2018.And Mr. Musk has gone into businesses before that naysayers had said were doomed and proved them wrong, like manufacturing electric cars. Twitter has suffered years of mismanagement and may benefit from fixing its business out of the glare of the public markets. Mr. Musk could bring new product ideas and hire engineering experts who might not have wanted to work for Twitter before.Mr. Musk is ""a phenomenal capital allocator, and I think he'll make a lot of money in Twitter,"" said Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist who was an early Facebook executive. ""It doesn't fit my risk profile. But I think he's going to be very successful.""Others caution against the ebullience that initially drove investors to Mr. Musk's deal, warning that the lure of tech visionaries can fade with market fortunes, especially as global economic fears have mushroomed in recent months.""At the height of a market boom, those appeals work more easily than they do in times like we are presently entering,"" said Robert Bruner, a professor at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia and author of the book ""Deals From Hell.""Mr. Bruner said the worst deals are typically struck at the peak of a market -- as with Mr. Musk's purchase of Twitter. He offered what he thought could be a worst-case scenario for the company. In that future, Mr. Musk would not be able to ""get the expenses down to the level necessary to cover the debt burden."" That would ""slowly erode the company's equity, and he's unable to find more equity investors.""The final outcome? ""Slowly, Twitter implodes,"" Mr. Bruner said.Maureen Farrell contributed reporting.Maureen Farrell contributed reporting.PhotographTwitter's headquarters in San Francisco.

415,1-Nov-22,Barron's (Online),This Is Elon Musk's Big Opportunity at Twitter,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2730490287/BFD812D457A14912PQ/550?accountid=13946,"Earlier this year, Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey posted that Elon Musk was the ""singular solution"" he trusted for running the social media platform. He may come to regret that sentiment.
Much of the attention during Musk's first weekend as Twitter's owner was on the initial round of chaos—from executive turnover and advertiser uncertainty over content moderation policy to a potential move in charging a monthly fee for identity verification.
But all of these topics are likely to be a rounding error, compared with the big upcoming expansion that Twitter is likely to make in the area of payments.
The numbers tell the story. Paid verification—even at a reported fee of $20 per month—or attempting to increase brand advertising won't add the many billions in sales necessary for Musk to generate a return on his $44 billion purchase of Twitter. But payments have the potential to do so.
Let's look at history. When Dorsey ran Twitter he did little to advance Twitter's payments capabilities. When the company did launch something in the category, it was essentially links to external third-party services. Analysts found it befuddling because Dorsey runs Block (ticker: SQ), the company formerly known as Square, that had developed an innovative payments product.
But that may have been the reason that held Twitter back. Perhaps Dorsey didn't want Twitter to cannibalize Block's successful Cash app. Musk will have no such conflict.
Expanding into payments makes sense financially. Twitter already has roughly 240 million daily active users as of the June quarter. If the social media platform can create a better payments service, it can easily market the feature to its large customer base through email or other contact information.
A comprehensive Twitter payments service would enable more innovation and could provide ancillary benefits that attract more users. Twitter can create a Twitter Coin where users can gift currency, visibility, and perks to amplify the best high-quality content on the platform. Reddit and Twitch already do similar things.
The market spoils are large in the space. PayPal (PYPL) has a market value of nearly $100 billion and generated $6.8 billion in revenue for the June quarter with about 429 million active accounts. Block is worth about $35 billion with a large part of its value coming from its Cash app, which has 47 million active accounts for the month of June. These type of numbers are attainable for Twitter given its scale.
Musk has expertise in the space, as do friends who are giving him advice and input on Twitter. Two decades ago, Musk worked at PayPal and helped spark the advent of faster digital payments. Further, the New York Times reported that former PayPal chief operating officer and venture capitalist David Sacks was seen at Twitter's headquarters after Musk's takeover.
Twitter didn't respond to a request for comment over its future product plans in the payments area.
Sacks talked about Twitter's opportunity in payments last weekend, citing Musk's repeated success in figuring out viable business models for his mission-based entrepreneurial adventures—Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX.
""Payments is an entire road map. There's a lot that can be done there. You can layer on a lot of services on top of that,"" Sacks said on the All-In podcast. ""What's amazing about Elon as an entrepreneur is he always starts with a mission. And then he figures how to turn it into a great product and a great business,"" adding ""he's still operating at the top of his game.""
At Telsa, Musk has upended the auto industry and accelerated the move toward sustainable electric transportation. His reusable rockets at SpaceX could one day enable interplanetary travel. Twitter may become Musk's next venture to change the world to create the main global town square.
Musk has said that the China-based WeChat would be a good model for Twitter. The executive has said he wants to create a similar all encompassing app for Western markets that would include a seamless payments capability, advanced messaging features, and more. Musk recently posted that buying Twitter is ""an accelerant"" of this everything app he calls ""X.""
Despite spending billions on research and development, Twitter's service is essentially unchanged since it first began.
Musk has already disrupted the auto and space industries. Now he'll try to do the same thing with other industries via Twitter.

Mr. Musk's advisers have also assigned a team of Twitter's engineers to work on its ""verification"" program, the system that doles out badges to high-profile or notable users to confirm their profiles' authenticity. Twitter could charge users $20 a month to retain their verified status, two people with knowledge of the discussions said.Mr. Musk, 51, flew to New York on Sunday after spending much of last week at Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco, according to one person familiar with his movements and a Twitter account that tracks the location of his private jet. Some of his trusted confidants remain in San Francisco, the people said, including David Sacks, a venture capitalist, and Sriram Krishnan, a former Twitter product leader and partner at the investment firm Andreessen Horowitz, which invested in Mr. Musk's buyout of Twitter.Other advisers, many of whom were in a ""war room"" with Mr. Musk at Twitter's headquarters last week, include Jared Birchall, the head of Mr. Musk's family office, Alex Spiro, his personal lawyer, and Jason Calacanis, a tech investor and podcaster, said six people with knowledge of the matter. Mr. Musk also brought about 50 engineers, product leaders and staff members to Twitter from his other companies, such as the electric carmaker Tesla, the tunnel company the Boring Company and rocket maker SpaceX, said four people with knowledge of the matter and internal documents viewed by The New York Times.Their actions have thrown Twitter's 7,500 employees into upheaval, with current and former workers trading private messages and forming group chats to discuss what is happening at the company. Some are calling Mr. Musk's advisers ""Elon's goons."" Many are worried about whether they will still have jobs.Mr. Musk, who has a reputation as an aggressive manager, has moved quickly to overhaul Twitter since he completed the $44 billion buyout of the company on Thursday. He immediately fired the company's chief executive, chief financial officer and others. He also said he would form a content moderation council to decide what kinds of posts to keep up on Twitter and what to take down, and said he would not instantly reinstate users who had been banned from the platform.His changes are not expected to subside anytime soon. Mr. Musk, who loaded $13 billion of debt onto Twitter for the buyout, faces financial pressure to turn its business around so he can pay the interest -- about $1 billion a year -- on the debt. It will be a challenge. Twitter has not turned a profit for eight out of the last 10 years, and the broader digital advertising market has been hit by global economic fears.Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment, while Twitter declined to comment. Some of Mr. Musk's advisers have tweeted about how they are working with the billionaire on helping the company make the transition.Mr. Musk's work on changing Twitter's verification program was reported earlier by The Verge.On Monday, Jack Dorsey, a Twitter founder, disclosed in a regulatory filing that he had rolled over his stake in the social media service into the new company under Mr. Musk's ownership. The value of Mr. Dorsey's stake was roughly $1 billion based on Mr. Musk's purchase price for Twitter.At Twitter's headquarters last week, Mr. Musk and his advisers met with top managers, two people involved in the meetings said. Those managers were asked to explain their teams and what their divisions did, the people said, including detailing how Twitter's algorithms sort and serve up content, the relationships with key advertisers and how the advertising platforms work.Twitter managers involved in the conversations said they felt as if they were being evaluated for their jobs. Some slept at the office on Friday and Saturday nights, they said.The managers were also asked for lists of their teams and the ""top performers,"" said four people involved in the deliberations, adding that this was a way for Mr. Musk and his colleagues to determine who to keep and who to cut. Mr. Spiro and Mr. Birchall are crunching the numbers and looking closely at layoffs, two people said.In the event of mass layoffs, Mr. Musk is required by the U.S. Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act to provide advance notice to the government and employees. Employees have not received any notification, four employees said. A spokeswoman for San Francisco's Office of Economic and Workforce Development said that, as of Monday, the city had not received such a notice.""There's a lot of pressure to do it as quickly as possible,"" Brian J.M. Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, said of job cuts. Mr. Musk ""is under pressure almost from the get-go to reduce costs at Twitter. Revenues are obviously down.""At least two Twitter employees, who were publicly critical of Mr. Musk and his takeover, were fired in recent days, said two people at the company.Mr. Musk and his advisers have also explored immediate changes to the app to bolster revenue. That includes changes to Twitter's verification program, which was free for approved users. Mr. Musk now wants to charge people $20 a month to keep their verified status and set a Nov. 7 deadline for the change, or people on the verification team would face termination, two people with knowledge of the efforts said. Terms of the new program are still in discussion and could change during product development, they added.Some employees said the change could trigger tax implications for Twitter, while others worried about regulatory pushback, two employees said. Some verified users who are known as Very Important Tweeters could also be on a list led by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or O.F.A.C., which is an agency of the Treasury Department that manages and administers international sanctions. It may be illegal for a company to accept money from certain users on such a list.At least one product shift -- an alteration of Twitter's logged-out home page that now shows trending topics instead of a login screen -- has already been carried out, in what three people said was a test of engineers' capabilities.On Sunday, Mr. Musk also ran a poll on Twitter asking if he should ""bring back Vine,"" a short video platform that the social media company bought and later shut down.Some current and former employees have created private Slack groups outside of Twitter to commiserate with one another, said four people who are in the groups. In one such group, former Twitter employees are trying to spread ""positive"" messages as insiders worry about the fate of their employment.On Monday, some workers tweeted dark jokes about refreshing their email inboxes as they awaited a layoffs announcement.On Sunday night, after a Twitter account that follows Mr. Musk's private plane showed that it had landed at New Jersey's Teterboro Airport, speculation arose among Twitter employees that he would appear at the company's New York office this week.""We're having a very productive day meeting with the marketing and advertising community here in New York,"" Mr. Calacanis, one of Mr. Musk's advisers, tweeted on Monday. ""So many great ideas on how to increase joy on the platform!""Lauren Hirsch contributed reporting.Lauren Hirsch contributed reporting.PhotographElon Musk has an added reason to turn Twitter's business around: He loaded $13 billion of debt on the company for the $44 billion buyout completed Thursday.

417,2-Nov-22,Detroit Free Press,Musk in charge: GM rethinking Twitter: Automaker pauses ads but still engaging on platform,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2730919821/BFD812D457A14912PQ/397?accountid=13946,"Just hours after billionaire Elon Musk completed the purchase of social media giant Twitter on Friday, General Motors applied the brakes to its advertising presence on the site, despite potentially reaching hundreds of millions of active users on Twitter each month.
On Monday and Tuesday, GM's position remained the same: It continues to hit pause on paid advertising on Twitter while it evaluates the social media platform's new direction under Musk, a spokesman said. Likewise, Ford Motor Co. is not currently advertising on Twitter and will continue to watch Twitter's direction under new ownership.
""We do not currently have any ads running on Twitter,"" Ford spokesman Said Deep told the Free Press on Tuesday. ""We will continue to evaluate the direction of the platform under the new ownership. Meanwhile, we continue to engage with our consumers on the platform.""
A spokesperson for Stellantis said the company did not have a comment.
Marketing experts said GM's move likely was calculated and strategic. After all, Musk first started pursuing the acquisition of Twitter in mid-April, so Friday's news is hardly a surprise. Then there is GM's push into electric vehicles, which will soon make the automaker a rival to Musk-led electric vehicle maker Tesla. Most companies don't want to put money in their competitor's pockets.
Also, there are the unknowns of a Musk-led Twitter and changes he might make. Since Friday, he has already fired the board of directors and is considering asking users to pay for verification, according to a PBS report. Musk promised to cut back some of Twitter's content restrictions to promote free speech, too, but he said there would be no major decisions on content or reinstating of banned accounts until a ""content moderation council"" with diverse viewpoints is established.
This means GM needs to study whether its ad dollars will deliver a return on investment there or are better spent somewhere else, experts said. In short, GM's pause on paying to advertise on Twitter might turn permanent.
""Elon Musk is known as a person that everything he touches, he revolutionizes. So him buying Twitter is an unknown and in the long term there will be changes for sure in the direction of this platform,"" said Ayalla Ruvio, a business and marketing professor at Michigan State University. ""This is a strategic move. GM is saying, 'What does it mean for us in the space as we bring out EV cars?' It doesn't mean that GM will not be on Twitter, it just means they won't advertise on Twitter and that's a big, big difference.""
Problems with a free bird
In its statement Friday, GM spokesman David Barnas said the automaker is engaging with Twitter, ""to understand the direction of the platform under their new ownership. As is normal course of business with a significant change in a media platform, we have temporarily paused our paid advertising. Our customer care interactions on Twitter will continue.""
GM, like all automakers, does not disclose the details of its ad budget. So it is hard to quantify the impact of GM's current move, marketing experts said.
""(The spend) might not be significant at all, but the optics of it looks retaliatory,"" said Marcus Collins, marketing professor at the University of Michigan. ""They're saying, 'Its new ownership has voiced a philosophical difference from status quo, so we're going to take a pause to see where this is going.' That's a responsible thing to do whether it's Elon Musk or Marcus Collins.""
Collins said it is probable GM could permanently keep its paid advertising off of Twitter.
""If there's more value using those resources on TikTok or another platform, as opposed to Twitter,"" Collins said. ""I say that calculus happens regardless of who owns the platform. That's a calculus they should have been doing before Elon Musk owned the company.""
Of course, the Musk presence cannot be discounted. GM CEO Mary Barra is typically artful at dodging questions about Tesla and Musk as a competitor, but she did throw some shade on him last year. Reporters asked her to comment on Musk suggesting that President Joe Biden's spending bill be ""deleted."" The bill, which included up to a $12,500 tax credit for EVs and subsidies for EV charging stations, favors union automakers, rather than Tesla.
""I'm not going to get into a match on that type of stuff because I actually mean what I say and say what I mean,"" Barra said at the time. ""When I say something, I really mean it and I'm an engineer, so I am going to execute it.""
Cost-benefit analysis
So just what does Musk mean when he says certain things? The question is something marketing experts ponder when considering Musk tweeting ""The Bird Is Freed"" last week after buying Twitter in a $44 billion deal.
""He was referring to it being a much more open platform for people to express their opinions,"" Ruvio said. But she added that she inferred Musk's comment to also assure that it ""will not be the Wild West"" where people can say whatever they want without consequences.
But Collins said he got the sense that people took that to mean, ""you can do whatever you want and say what you want to say."" The proof, Collins said, is that in the 12 hours after Musk acquired Twitter, use of the N-word on the site surged 500%, according to The Washington Post.
""I could see GM and others saying, 'I don't want to be in this place,'"" Collins said. ""This all boils down to a cost-benefit analysis, is the juice worth the squeeze?""
Twitter's tech audience
Wayne State University business professor Marick Masters has studied social media platforms for a future book. He said he wouldn't be surprised if a new social medium pops up to replace Twitter one day, started by someone else.
""It's a fluid situation and it's uncertain,"" Masters said of the social media landscape.
GM will have to decide which audience it wants to reach across all advertising: traditional, as well as social media sites. Twitter's monthly active user numbers have been about 345 million for much of this year, according to Adobe.com, but there are bigger sites. With nearly 3 billion monthly users, Facebook is the largest social media platform in the world. But Instagram tops Twitter by surpassing 1 billion monthly users.
Still, 63% of Twitter users are ages 35 to 65, with men making up nearly two-thirds, Adobe.com said. In the U.S., which is GM's largest market, there are 81 million Twitter users, roughly a quarter of the country's population, according to Adobe.com.
About 40% of Twitter users are on the site multiple times a day and Twitter's popularity is highest with tech-savvy users, a benefit for GM as it rolls out new technology on some 30 new EVs it will bring to market over the next three years.
For those reasons, it may make sense for GM to resume paying to advertise on it again.
""See what the platform will look like and if it looks like it'll be a reasonable platform with a good audience ... then they should make the decision to reinstate their advertising and go forward from there,"" Masters said. ""I don't think the fact that a competitor owns it should be a disqualifier or a concern. You go where the audience is ... go where the options are to reach the audience.""
GM is no threat
It also remains free for GM to tweet about its products, a promotion that will reach GM's 800,000 followers on @GM.
""Musk can't tell them not to do that, and they will gladly do it,"" Ruvio said. ""Being on a competitor's website and promoting your product is super smart and savvy.""
And Musk is likely going to be OK with GM and others tweeting their wares, Ruvio said.
""GM is not a threat to him,"" Ruvio said. ""If he does not let them do that, he's admitting he's afraid. It challenges his credibility. He won't risk that and frankly, I don't think he's afraid. His brand (Tesla) is so well-established and considered a market leader that him allowing GM to continue tweeting is miniscule. It may be different in the future.""
As for how Twitter might change, Ruvio saidto expect more technological advances moreso than rules about who can post and who cannot.
""For the average consumer, they won't even make the connection between Tesla, Twitter and GM not paying for advertisements,"" Ruvio said, warning automakers, ""If you start eliminating things, you really limit your reach to consumers and you can't afford to do that. It's time to consider being more liberal to the thought of your competitors.""

418,3-Nov-22,Barron's (Online),Powell Zigged When Markets Wanted a Zag. Expect Higher Rates for Longer.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2731358676/BFD812D457A14912PQ/245?accountid=13946,"Markets thought they got what they wanted from the Federal Reserve's penultimate meeting of the year, before it was cruelly snatched away.
If the prospect of a slowdown in interest rate hikes, suggested by the Fed's official statement , was music to the ears of investors, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference was the equivalent of a deafening bang.
Powell said that recent data suggests the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected, adding there was still ""some ways to go"" when it comes to hikes and taming inflation.
Stocks dramatically reversed course, erasing initial gains and sinking lower. The Nasdaq Composite was the worst hit index, closing 3.4% down.
Markets were desperate for signs of a Fed pivot and the spectacular performance of equities in October suggests they thought it was coming. The obsession over when a pivot might come is unlikely to stop. If anything, upcoming economic data will be even more closely watched for clues as to the future direction of rate hikes.
Interestingly, when Powell was asked about stock and bond markets initially reacting positively to its latest hike, he responded with a series of hawkish statements . The market had actually already turned lower, but he wasn't to know that.
""I would want people to understand our commitment to getting this done, and to not making the mistake of not doing enough or the mistake of withdrawing our strong policy and doing that too soon,"" he said.
If Powell's aim was to signal a slowdown in rate hikes but prevent a market rally, then he's done it successfully, as unpopular as it might be.

Fed Hints at Slower Pace of Rate Increases Up Ahead
The Federal Reserve will consider making a smaller increase to its benchmark interest rate at its next meeting in December, but ultimately rates are likely to overshoot the levels predicted by the central bank's policy makers at their meeting in September, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters.
* Powell's message made it clear that while another 0.75 percentage point increase might not be in store—and the Fed has yet to decide—there will be more interest rate increases, if only smaller. That gives policy makers time to watch as their work does its job on inflation.
* Powell said any slowing in the pace of rate increases shouldn't be interpreted as the Fed thinking it was done raising rates. ""It is very premature to be thinking about pausing,"" Powell said, ""We think we have a ways to go.""
* The Fed's committee acknowledged it could take time for this year's rate increases to filter through the economy, saying they'll take into account the lags between when monetary policy is set and its effect on economic activity and inflation in making further moves.
* About concerns that the Fed had raised interest rates too much , Powell said ""I don't have any sense that we've overtightened or moved too fast."" People have questioned whether the Fed could overshoot as the rate increases eventually start to restrain spending, hiring and investment.
What's Next: Two months of employment and Consumer Price Index readings come before the Fed's next meeting, starting with Friday's October jobs report. Futures markets are predicting the greatest odds of a peak rate of 5.00% to 5.25% in the first half of 2023, then a decline.

Housing Market Weakness Pressuring Real Estate Firms
The continuing slow down in the housing market is forcing online home buyer Opendoor Technologies to lay off 18% of its staff . CEO Eric Wu said in a company blog that it's ""one of the most challenging"" real estate markets in 40 years. Opendoor reports earnings after today's close.
* The volume of home purchase loan applications fell for the sixth week in a row last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association said. The purchase loan volume was 41% lower than the same week last year, while refinancing volume was down 85% from last year.
* Home loan applications declined even though average mortgage rates on a 30-year fixed loan fell to 7.08%, from 7.16% the prior week. Prospective buyers who have seen 30-year fixed loan rates more than double this year find little encouragement to step off the sidelines.
* The average home sold for $384,800 in September, meaning buyers who put 20% down would pay nearly $750 more on their monthly mortgage payments than if they had bought a home at last year's 3.14% rate, The Wall Street Journal reported.
* Real estate firm Zillow is done selling houses a year after ditching its iBuying home-flipping business. While beating expectations for third quarter earnings, Zillow foresees lower revenue in the fourth quarter amid higher mortgage rates. It also cut more workers last week.
What's Next: Zillow executives said rising rates are just part of the trouble facing the industry. Persistent low inventory and a lackluster flow of new listings mean ""the setup to begin 2023 in housing looks challenged,"" they said.

Roku's Weak Outlook Sends Stock into Nosedive
Roku shares fell 19% after-hours on Wednesday after it warned about the effects of inflationary pressures and the slowdown in advertising spending : Total net revenue for the fourth quarter is forecast to be $800 million, or a 7.5% drop from last year. Gross profit is also projected to fall 14%.
* CEO Anthony Wood told listeners on a conference call that it is ""not a normal holiday season."" Inflation is putting pressure on consumer discretionary spending and eroding ad budgets. Executives said it's likely temporary, but they won't predict when things will turn around.
* The third quarter was unexpectedly strong. Revenue rose 12% from last year and its net loss of 88 cents a share was narrower than analysts had forecast. But operating costs rose 71%, which the company attributed to hiring since last year. It began slowing hiring in the second quarter.
* Total streaming hours of 21.9 billion in the third quarter was a 21% gain from the same quarter last year and up 1.1 billion from the second quarter. Roku competes with big streaming platform operations such as Netflix and Walt Disney, both of which are planning ad-supported streaming.
* Roku is more exposed to the scatter ad market, or ads bought during the quarter, than the typical TV network, MarketWatch reported . Scatter spending is easy for marketing firms to turn on, and easier for them to turn off.
What's Next: Roku CFO Steve Louden plans to depart sometime in 2023 after a successor is found, the company added. Louden joined Roku in 2015 and saw it through its public listing in 2017. He was going to leave right before the pandemic broke out but decided to stay.

Elon Musk Oversees an Eventful First Week at Twitter
Elon Musk hasn't even been in charge of Twitter for a full week, but the developments at the now privately run social media company are coming thick and fast .
* The latest development is the billionaire entrepreneur is planning to cut about 3,700 jobs, or around half of the company's workforce, to cut costs, according to a report from Bloomberg.
* Musk set the tone on day one by firing Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and other senior executives. Then he quickly dissolved the board of directors and became the company's sole director.
* He then announced plans to charge $8 a month for users to be verified with a blue check. He initially considered a $20 fee before a Twitter dispute with horror fiction author Stephen King turned into a negotiation of sorts.
* There were also reports that Musk had pulled dozens of engineers from Tesla, the electric vehicle maker he is also in charge of, to help turn around Twitter. That's worrying for Tesla investors who are going to want them working on the next car platform.
What's Next: All the changes may lead companies to reconsider their advertising spending on Twitter. General Motors has already said it is pausing paid ads on the social media platform as it seeks more information about the site's direction under its new owner.

How to Beat the IRS: Sell Your Bitcoin, Then Buy It Back
Cryptocurrency investors can take advantage of a tax loophole that's not available to stockholders and other investors and could help them convert this year's steep downturn in the value of Bitcoin and other digital currencies into a multiyear advantage.
* Internal Revenue Service rules prevent investors from claiming a tax benefit for selling a security at a loss if they buy that same security or one ""substantially identical"" to it within 30 days before or after that sale. But digital tokens are considered property, so this wash-sale rule doesn't apply.
* Digital token holders could sell their losers and lock in the losses, using them to offset the capital gains they made elsewhere or offset up to $3,000 a year of ordinary income. The losses can be used for years even if there are no gains to offset this year.
* The same investor can buy the same digital token right away without losing the tax advantage. The IRS can still go after investors who too aggressively use the strategy—say by selling Bitcoin and buying back seconds later—since transactions need to have economic substance beyond taking tax losses, to be valid.
* Morgan Stanley analysts noted that a record number of Bitcoins—about 78%—haven't transacted in the past six months. That indicates crypto investors haven't gotten the tax message. People seem averse to locking in their losses and are likely waiting for Bitcoin's price to rally before selling, the analysts said.
What's Next: The loophole may be nearing an end for crypto investors. Lawmakers have more than once threatened to end it. They slipped it in the Build Back Better legislation but the successor bill that actually became law omitted it. It could be revived the next time Congress needs a revenue raiser.

What would Republican control of the House and Senate mean for your tax bill—and your ability to get a human on the phone at the IRS next tax season?
The Internal Revenue Service has hired 4,000 people to help pick up the phone, speak with puzzled taxpayers and assist with other customer-service issues during the upcoming tax season, the agency said Thursday.
It's months before millions of Americans will submit their 2022 income taxes, but the IRS says the hiring now will hopefully make it a smoother ride compared to recent years when people tried to get through to a person at the tax agency.

419,4-Nov-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk's Legacy Is on the Line at Twitter,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2731867478/BFD812D457A14912PQ/246?accountid=13946,"Pioneer or poseur? Genius or jackass? Savior or threat? Elon Musk is America's new favorite wedge issue. And his acquisition of Twitter provides a riveting test.
The global town hall, as it's called, has always been a pitiful earner. And Musk, its biggest star, has paid top dollar for it, and then some. If he can remake Twitter into a platform whose prosperity matches its power, or into a thriving and respected public service, haters will find it difficult to dispute the man's product savvy and vision.
If Twitter nosedives, Musk will remain stratospherically rich—one doesn't amass $300 billion and then fall on hard times. But the mythos surrounding him, and perhaps even the sheen of his other businesses, could take a hit.
Brett Winton, who holds the title of chief futurist at ARK Investment Management, which now invests privately in Twitter and publicly in Tesla (ticker: TSLA), says that Musk's contribution to the future of self-driving cars has already secured his legacy. ""You could have everything else go up in flames, and I think he would still be seen as one of the most remarkable entrepreneurs and inventors of all time,"" he says.
Scott Galloway, an entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and marketing professor at New York University, says that ""the limousine liberal is now the Tesla owner,"" and that Musk is ""increasingly adopting a narrative that feels pretty far right, whether it's carrying the water of Xi or Putin."" Galloway has sold his Tesla vehicle. ""I don't like the man,"" he says.
Like we said: wedge issue. Ahead, we'll look at what a financially successful run for Musk at Twitter might look like, and its chances. We'll size up the outlook for Tesla, now a solid cash generator, with shares that are down 40% for the year. And we'll dance delicately around the culture war stuff but maybe jabber just a bit about the meaning of Musk.
Musk says his purpose in buying Twitter isn't to make money. Good thing. He might have just paid $44 billion for a business that would otherwise be trading now at less than half that value. Before Musk made his $54.20 offer in April, he had scooped up a big stake in Twitter shares. And before that, the stock was trading below $35.
Since then, online advertising trends, and the stock market's treatment of companies that rely on them, haven't been kind. Meta Platforms (META) has lost more than half of its value since mid-March. Snap (SNAP) is down by two-thirds . Even a milder one-third decline for Twitter, had Musk not come along, would have seen it valued now at barely $20 billion.
Revenue for Twitter this year was pegged at just over $5 billion before the deal closed and Wall Street analysts pulled their stock coverage and estimates. For Twitter to be worth such a high multiple of revenue, it would have to be fast-growing or exceptionally profitable. For now, it's neither.
Twitter's last quarterly report as a public company showed second-quarter revenue growing just 2% in constant currency. Management at the time blamed advertising industry headwinds and uncertainty related to the Musk takeover.
In an Oct. 27 tweet addressing advertisers, Musk wrote that the reason he bought Twitter was to ""help humanity, whom I love"" by promoting healthy debate at a time when traditional media has ""fueled and catered to...polarized extremes."" Twitter, he wrote, ""obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!""
Three days later, Musk tweeted a baseless claim by a conspiracy website that an attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband was the result of a lover's quarrel. Hours later, the tweet disappeared without comment from Musk. So, let's call brand safety a work in progress.
""Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation,"" Musk tweeted on Friday. Another explanation is the surge in racial slurs on Twitter following the takeover—companies will want to see how Musk can protect their brands from appearing next to objectionable content.
A revenue downturn would hit at an inopportune time. The deal has left Twitter with $13 billion in debt. Incremental interest could total $700 million over the next year, give or take, says MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni, who covered Twitter as a public company. Assuming a $300,000 all-in cost per employee, Twitter would need to lay off perhaps 2,500 workers, or a third of its staff, just to keep recent operating losses from growing, he says.
Musk, who has already let go top Twitter leadership, has begun laying off other workers.
But what about growth? Paid subscriptions, recently less than 9% of total revenue, are the likeliest lane for now. There's already a $4.99 a month service called Twitter Blue with a thin list of premium features, like the ability to undo a tweet before others see it.
Musk floated the idea of charging $20 a month for verified or ""blue check mark"" status. When the novelist Stephen King tweeted a colorfully worded no vote and threatened to leave the platform, Musk replied, ""How about $8?"" When New York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez chided Musk on Twitter for ""selling"" free speech for $8 a month, he replied, ""Your feedback is appreciated. Now pay $8.""
Based on the new boss' latest trail of Twitter clues, a blue-check subscription would probably come with fewer ads and priority placement in stacks of replies and search results, which would help combat scams and bots.
Don't count out demand. ARK's Winton calls the current verification system subjective, like a ""modern knighthood or something,"" and says the new subscription plan would clean up misbehavior and expand the pool of verified users, allowing for new types of transactions, perhaps with cryptocurrency. This is the so-called super-app theory—that Twitter can be far more than tweets.
MKM's Kulkarni says that a super app like China's Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) has would be ""significantly harder, in my opinion, to bring together, particularly in the Western world."" Twitter should instead focus on moving beyond its past of ""significant mismanagement"" and ""underappreciated potential"" by tackling misinformation, simplifying the user experience, and growing its customer base to begin taking meaningful market share in advertising.
""If things go well and if they clean up their act, probably that is a multibagger situation,"" says Kulkarni, referring to the prospect of Musk bringing Twitter public again in the future for a multiple of the price he paid. ""There's not going to be another Twitter in the world.""
NYU's Galloway says that Musk would have to multiply what is probably Twitter's true value today just to break even on the price he paid, which he calls a ""tough one."" But he also points to Twitter's untapped value to many of its users, who can get paid thousands of dollars for a promoted tweet. ""I don't see why they would be out of line to take the Apple route and say we want 30% of that.""
Retaining key talent and big tweeters while soothing advertisers will be key. Laura Huang, who teaches management and entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School, isn't put off by Musk's manner. ""He's a jarring person,"" she says. ""There's no way to not offend anyone in a situation like this."" Huang calls Musk a ""master of A-B testing"" and says that some of his comments are just ""testing different things that he could be putting into place.""
There's an awkward reality here about politics and profits. If Musk is indeed moving to the right, that's his business. If he's doing so in smash-mouth style, same. But 32% of U.S. adults who lean Democrat say they use Twitter, which is 15 points higher than those who lean Republican, according to Pew Research. Electric vehicles aren't just for lefty greens, but surveys suggest a similar skew there. Perception here matters at least as much as reality; it can't be good for business if a meaningful portion of customers comes to believe that the owner is trolling them.
Tesla's stock market value, recently near $680 billion, has long dwarfed those of legacy car makers like Ford Motor (F), about $53 billion, and General Motors (GM), $55 billion. Now, Tesla is pulling ahead on moneymaking, too. Next year, its free cash flow could total $14.6 billion, according to analysts polled by FactSet, compared with Ford's $4.1 billion and $5.9 billion for GM.
The outlook from here for Tesla depends greatly on whether one views it as a software platform with an insurmountable lead or as a manufacturer that puts metal on wheels. That difference explains why the bull and bear cases could hardly be further apart.
ARK's Winton predicts that self-driving taxis will deliver $26 trillion in incremental gross domestic product by 2030, and be ""the most macroeconomically impactful innovation ever brought to bear on humanity""—counting the steam engine. Tesla, he says, will command a majority of this market, or at least the leading share.
NYU's Galloway, meanwhile, calls Tesla ""the most overvalued stock in the world."" He compares it to Netflix (NFLX), which faced limited competition in streaming for years, and now is struggling to grow.
Tesla and Netflix are similar in another way. Both soared in value during a decade of near-zero interest rates, and all that stock market value allowed for aggressive cash burn rates without creditors getting spooked. Both companies are now well over the hump financially. But growth stocks aren't worshiped quite the same now that savers can get a few percent on safe money.
There's a well-worn Twitter meme featuring a theatergoer excitedly munching popcorn. It means that the tweet it's attached to is sure to launch a fun-to-watch flame war in the replies. We're all good for now on online high jinks. Here's hoping the next plot twist features robots or rockets instead.

 Elon Musk's Legacy Is on the Line at Twitter

420,4-Nov-22,Los Angeles Times,BUSINESS; Twitter employees fear getting stiffed on severance; New owner Elon Musk plans major layoffs. Will he push the envelope on legal protections?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2731647808/BFD812D457A14912PQ/461?accountid=13946,"In recent years, big technology companies have dangled ever more generous benefits to entice engineers in a seller's talent market. Layoffs, a rarity in Silicon Valley over the last decade, have typically come with the consolation of generous severance packages often including months of salary and healthcare coverage.
Now that expectation is collapsing -- and nowhere more rapidly than at Twitter, where thousands of employees are suddenly facing the prospect of joblessness in a newly chilly employment landscape.
Under new owner Elon Musk, the social media platform is preparing to terminate a large portion of its workforce -- about half of its 7,500 workers, according to Bloomberg.

In an email shared with the Los Angeles Times, the company said all employees would be notified of whether they still had their job via email by 9 a.m. Friday. All offices will be temporarily closed and badge access suspended, and any employees at an office were asked to return home, the email said.
Since Musk's $44-billion takeover was completed a week ago, there has been widespread concern among employees about what severance benefits they might receive and how Musk might seek to reduce them.
The Twitter layoff news comes during widespread layoffs in the tech industry, with Lyft announcing layoffs of 13% of its staff and Stripe cutting 14% of its workforce.
Stripe announced a generous severance payout of 14 weeks plus more for longer tenure, as well as six months of healthcare, 2022 bonuses and accelerated stock vesting for laid-off employees.
It's unclear what benefits Twitter employees might receive, but in the event of a mass layoff, workers have some rights protected by both state and federal law, as well as the terms of the merger agreement between Musk and Twitter.
Musk, however, has a long history of pushing the legal envelope in matters involving regulations around how Tesla advertises its autonomous driving capabilities, an agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to get his tweets approved in advance, a public health order to close a factory during COVID-19 lockdowns and numerous other examples.
In his pursuit of Twitter, Musk ignored SEC disclosure requirements and tried to back out of a signed merger agreement.
Employees have some protection in the terms of that merger agreement, which states that Musk must provide severance payments and benefits to employees terminated within one year of the acquisition that are ""no less favorable"" than those applicable before Musk took over.
Ramish Saqib, who worked as a software engineer at Twitter for a year, said he was given one week's notice and 60 days of severance pay when he was laid off in July.
Speaking on background, another former employee said the standard severance for large layoffs was 60 days with additional pay based on years of tenure.
If Musk doesn't offer similar severance packages to employees laid off in the next year, they would have grounds to sue the company as intended third-party beneficiaries to the agreement, said Lloyd Greif, chief executive of Greif & Co., an investment bank that handles mergers and acquisitions.
""It's a promise from the company to the employees that when Elon Musk signed on the dotted line to buy Twitter, he became the company,"" Greif said. ""They could bring an action against the company he now owns ... to enforce that promise.""
Musk skimping on severance packages for laid-off employees would certainly invite class-action litigation against the company under elements of the California labor code meant to protect workers in these types of situations, Greif said.
Under the federal WARN Act, companies with more than 100 employees are required to give at least 60 days' notice if they plan to lay off more than a third of the workers at one location or more than 500 employees, regardless of the percentage, within a 30-day period.
An employer that violates the notice requirement may be liable for back pay for the number of days less than the 60-day requirement. Companies often offer 60 days of severance pay in lieu of notice.
California's WARN Act is even stricter, applying when there's a layoff of 50 or more employees within a 30-day period, and the employer can be liable for civil penalties in addition to the back pay.
According to a number of sources close to Twitter, there has been widespread speculation among employees in recent days that Musk may try to use for-cause firings to deny severance to many terminated workers. Immediately upon taking over, Musk set aggressive deadlines for new feature launches; managers reportedly urged their teams to work 12-hour days and sleep in the office or risk being targeted for dismissal.
Musk already terminated several top Twitter executives last week, including its CEO and chief financial officer. By classifying them as for-cause firings, he is reportedly seeking to avoid paying compensations of $20 million to $60 million listed in the terms of the merger agreement.
In fact, the WARN Act does not distinguish between employees fired and those let go for cause, said Laura Reathaford, a California employment lawyer with Lathrop GPM. Companies are typically cautious about firing employees for cause during periods of large-scale workforce reductions and tend to handle such terminations as layoffs to avoid opening themselves up to legal scrutiny.
At the same time, WARN regulations are often ""cumbersome and confusing"" to enforce, making litigation over the act uncommon, Reathaford said.
Tesla, the electric-car maker that is the source of most of Musk's vast fortune, was sued in June by former employees who said the company violated the WARN Act by failing to provide 60 days' notice when it laid off more than 500 employees at a plant in Nevada.
Several software engineers who were laid off during that time in a 10% reduction of the workforce received only one week's severance and were told they were fired in secret meetings with their managers, according to reporting by Gergely Orosz in the Pragmatic Engineer.
Orosz said Tesla was trying to bypass the WARN Act by disguising the layoffs as performance-related terminations. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tesla does not maintain a media relations department or respond to media inquiries.

421,4-Nov-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Isn't Prepared for Twitter's Global-Security Risks,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2731772576/BFD812D457A14912PQ/502?accountid=13946,"About the author: Justin Sherman is a senior fellow at Duke's Sanford School of Public Policy, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, and an independent cybersecurity, technology policy, and geopolitical risk consultant.
Now that Elon Musk has acquired Twitter, the news is full of stories on how the world's richest person may change up the platform's content moderation practices. Some users are looking to Discord, Mastodon, and other services as Musk fires Twitter's top executives and the company's board . Mass layoffs are widely reported to be underway, including among the company's public-policy teams.
But another issue looms. Musk is so focused on his idea of ""censorship"" of U.S. users that he's forgetting about Twitter's users in the rest of the world—and that owning a platform is not just about content moderation. Twitter has over 320 million users globally and has offices in nearly two dozen countries. There are a range of physical security risks posed on the daily to Twitter employees, contractors, and users in hotspots around the globe. Owning Twitter means having responsibility for those safety issues, too, but Musk is far from ready.
Western democracies for years talked of the internet's liberalizing power, while forgetting that governments have numerous means at their disposal to crack down on the internet and its users in their borders. As Evgeny Morozov wrote in his 2011 book The Net Delusion , passwords can help protect data, but in countries with no rule of law, ""one can learn the password by torturing the system administrator without having to go through the courts."" Discussions of ""cyberspace,"" ""the cloud,"" and other abstract-sounding terminology often lead people to forget the physical infrastructure and human elements of the internet—and the way malicious actors can target them.
Twitter must grapple with these kinds of global security issues. In India, police raided Twitter offices when the company wouldn't comply with the ruling party's demands. The Russian government has targeted tech employees and contractors inside and outside of the country to coerce company leadership. Twitter is banned in China, but that hasn't stopped people from accessing it through anti-censorship workarounds—and it hasn't stopped authorities from arresting and hacking those using the platform, either.
Turkey's police have arrested people for using Twitter to spread what the government called ""untrue information, and just last month the parliament passed new censorship regulations. Horrific violence in Myanmar, Ethiopia, Ukraine, and other places is often entangled with content on Twitter, too. Tweets sometimes help expose atrocities. They can also help authorities and angry individuals perpetrate them. For example, Russian propagandists have been disseminating videos about Ukraine on Telegram, which individuals can then post on Twitter, without clear linkages to Russian state media.
This summer, Peter Zatko, the hacker known as ""Mudge"" and Twitter's now-former head of security, filed a whistleblower complaint against the company. It alleges that the Indian, Russian, and Nigerian governments, as well as one unnamed government, ""sought, with varying success, to force Twitter to hire local [full time employees] that could be used as leverage."" This follows the Justice Department charging two former Twitter employees in 2019 with spying for the Saudi Arabian government; they were said to be using their positions to access information on Saudi dissidents. Foreign intelligence services routinely attempt to infiltrate technology firms as well.
To be clear, many tech companies have problems in the global security arena. Although some employees are focused on and well aware of the risks, that doesn't always translate into executives acting accordingly. After Russia passed a local office law in 2021, requiring foreign tech firms to station representatives in-country, Apple and Google complied even though it was clearly a tool of Kremlin coercion. Sure enough, when the companies wouldn't delete an app made by Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, the Kremlin sent armed thugs to Google's Moscow office; the FSB, Russia's domestic-security service, chased down a Google executive; and members of parliament handed the companies lists of people they would haul off to jail. Both firms removed Navalny's app from their stores. The list of global-security issues goes on: Brazil arrested a Facebook executive in 2016 after the company wouldn't hand over data from WhatsApp related to an investigation; in March 2022, Belarus arrested a top Wikipedia editor responsible for editing pages about Russia's war on Ukraine.
Musk is not prepared for this reality where platform employees, contractors, and users face a host of global security risks. He has little experience navigating geopolitical security issues. He has kept his discussion of Twitter ownership entirely on content moderation in the U.S. And he has concerning geopolitical entanglements, too. Musk has many business stakes in China—Tesla has a major plant in Shanghai, and China is Tesla's second-largest market . Saudi Arabian Prince Alwaleed bin Talal rolled over his investment firm's $1.9 billion stake in Twitter to help Musk buy the company, making it Twitter's second-largest shareholder. These links to China and Saudi Arabia are potentially under national security investigation by the U.S. government. Further, Musk recently said that Beijing should take some control over Taiwan and before that suggested that Crimea, the Ukrainian region that Putin illegally invaded and annexed in 2014, should become ""formally part of Russia."" Both comments highlighted a disturbing view of authoritarianism.
Platforms operating at worldwide scale face a host of physical safety and security issues related to their employees, contractors, and users. While all companies have struggles in this space—and while many tech companies, from Google to Facebook, are too quick to comply with repressive demands—Musk appears utterly unprepared to properly deal with these complex geopolitical realities.

 Elon Musk Isn't Prepared for Twitter's Global-Security Risks

422,4-Nov-22,The Washington Post,Advertisers eye the door as Musk figures out his new toy,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2731616436/BFD812D457A14912PQ/548?accountid=13946,"As Twitter advertisers run for the exits, the world's richest man has apparently decided to set his $44 billion investment on fire.
Some might say Elon Musk, who last week became Twitter's official new owner, has buyer's remorse. But that implies he had actually wanted the thing before he bought it. Back in April, the mercurial billionaire made an overpriced takeover bid, which he then tried to back out of.
Perhaps understandably: Twitter has been plagued by problems for years, of both the monetary and moral kinds. When Musk made his offer, tech stocks were already tanking, and it was clear he had neither a plan for fixing the company nor the inclination to fritter away a big chunk of his fortune figuring it out. After some legal back-and-forth, he reluctantly agreed to complete the $44 billion acquisition.
Now Musk, who's also chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX (which don't exactly seem as though they should be part-time jobs), is trying to figure out what to do with his new toy.
He has already begun pursuing a few controversial changes. They include charging users for their ""blue check"" verification badges, as well as developing a new paid-video feature, which will probably be used for ""adult"" material. But his most perplexing moves involve simultaneous plans to A) police content less, while B) increasing advertising revenue.
These objectives are somewhat at odds.
Musk has long complained about censorship at Twitter, including the suspension of high-profile accounts (such as that of former president Donald Trump) and other users accused of hate speech or baseless conspiracy theories (the latter being something Musk himself occasionally traffics in). For this reason, his takeover has been cheered by free-speech absolutists as well as racists, Holocaust deniers and other tinfoil-hat-wearers who claim they've been ""shadow-banned"" or otherwise muzzled for too long.
Look, I'm not going to pretend that finding the right degree of content moderation is an easy task. Humans cannot agree on what counts as ""misinformation,"" so it's pretty hard to teach an algorithm to identify it. One man's fake news is another man's free speech. Allowing more hostile, off-color or otherwise dubious tweets will drive some users away, but banning them will infuriate other users (and some lawmakers), too.
Musk has made clear he'll allow a lot more content that once would have been purged and punished by Twitter personnel - which is perhaps an easier strategy to implement if you're considering laying off half your workforce.
Even before any concrete new content policy appears to have been implemented, legions of trolls and bigots have already begun testing the guardrails. In the 12 hours following Musk's finalized purchase, use of the n-word on Twitter jumped nearly 500 percent, according to the Princeton-based Network Contagion Research Institute.
Advertisers, Twitter's primary revenue source, are nervous about these developments, and what the platform might look like in the Musk era. Adidas may not want its logo appearing alongside, say, antisemitic tweets. (If you don't believe me, ask Kanye West, now known as Ye.) Family-friendly brands are probably not excited about appearing next to porn, either.
IPG and Havas Media, both multinational advertising companies, have advised clients to pause spending on Twitter for the time being, and a consulting firm owned by IPG reports that most clients surveyed plan to take the recommendation.
Some consumer brands have already done so, including General Motors (a Tesla competitor). The Financial Times, citing inside sources, reported Wednesday that L'Oréal had also suspended its advertising spending on the platform; the company subsequently released a statement saying it had not made ""any decision"" about Twitter ads.
But one can understand why the global cosmetics and hair-care giant might feel conflicted about the issue: Skinheads probably don't buy much shampoo, but they might be in the market for new sunscreen.
Musk's initial response to advertisers' concerns was to assure brands that Twitter won't devolve into a ""free-for-all hellscape"" (too late, methinks). When that strategy didn't work, he tried to cyberbully them into sticking around. In a Twitter poll posted Wednesday, he asked his followers whether advertisers should support ""freedom of speech"" or ""political 'correctness.' ""
It is hard to imagine that this strategy will be successful. Either Target and Pepsi and the like think it's a good use of their ad dollars to share a platform with neo-Nazis and incels, or it isn't. The whole thing reminds me a bit of progressives' recent attempts to scold and punish companies into lowering their prices, rather than change the incentives those firms face.
Musk and the Democratic Party may not have much in common these days. But perhaps they can bond over this one shared experience: They're both learning how hard it is to shame companies into doing something that isn't in their financial interest to do.

423,4-Nov-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Musk Scours Twitter for Revenue to Sustain It: [Business/Financial Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2731647847/BFD812D457A14912PQ/701?accountid=13946,"The billionaire and his advisers have discussed adding paid direct messages, fees to watch videos and other features to the service.Elon Musk, the new owner of Twitter, is throwing everything against the wall to make more money at the social media company.Since closing his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter last week, Mr. Musk and his advisers have discussed adding paid direct messages -- which would let users send private messages to high-profile users -- to the service, according to two people with knowledge of the matter and internal documents viewed by The New York Times.They have also talked about adding ""paywalled"" videos, which would mean that certain videos could not be viewed unless users paid a fee, these people said. And they have discussed reviving Vine, a onetime short-form video platform, which could attract a younger audience coveted by advertisers.This week, Mr. Musk moved to make money from Twitter's ""blue check"" verification program, a method of making sure users are who they say they are. The billionaire announced that the program, which is currently free, will be rolled into the ""Twitter Blue"" subscription service, which will offer enhanced features for a monthly $8 fee.The frenzy of product development underlines the pressure that Mr. Musk, the world's richest man, is under to deliver immediate results -- and returns -- on the technology industry's largest-ever leveraged buyout. To finance his Twitter deal, he loaded the company with $13 billion in debt, putting it on the hook to pay more than $1 billion annually in interest alone.But last year Twitter had less than $1 billion in cash flow, partly because of a one-time charge, meaning it generated less money than what it now owes its lenders annually. The company was also unprofitable for eight of the last 10 years. So, to make ends meet, Mr. Musk must boost Twitter's revenue or cut costs -- or do both.Mr. Musk has already ordered job cuts across Twitter. On Wednesday, a Twitter employee posted a link to a ""severance calculations"" document in a company Slack channel, noting that there was a ""master list"" that included the number 3,738, according to a copy of the message seen by The Times.If that figure refers to people who could be laid off, and if the number holds, it will amount to about 50 percent of Twitter's 7,500-person work force. Interns were excluded from the list, according to the copy of the message. Some of Mr. Musk's advisers held a conference call on Wednesday evening to try to finalize the number of cuts, according to internal memos and calendar entries viewed by The Times.Mr. Musk is also trying to minimize Twitter's infrastructure costs. In meetings with engineers, his advisers have proposed saving from $1 million to $3 million in infrastructure costs a day, said three people familiar with the talks. Lieutenants are also looking to make deep cuts to Twitter's ""Redbird"" organization, which consists of platform and infrastructure teams, the people said.Twitter faces difficulties earning advertising revenue under Mr. Musk, who has said he may loosen content rules on the service. On Thursday, General Mills and Audi's U.S. division said they had paused advertising on Twitter because of concerns about content moderation on the platform.Mr. Musk and representatives for Twitter did not respond to requests for comment. Bloomberg, The Washington Post, Axios and Jane Wong, an independent researcher, reported some details of the company's plans earlier.In an onstage interview at the TED Conference in April, Mr. Musk said owning Twitter ""is not a way to make money"" and added, ""I don't care about the economics at all.""Since then, however, the global economy has tipped toward recession, inflation and interest rates have soared and the digital advertising market -- which Twitter relies on for revenue -- has pulled back. Mr. Musk's own fortune is tied up largely in shares of his electric automaker, Tesla, whose stock has plummeted.In an attempt to spin up new lines of business at Twitter, over the past week Mr. Musk and his advisers have dispatched product teams to brainstorm any and all ideas that could quickly bring in money, according to 10 current and former employees and internal documents discussing the matter. Three people who have met with Mr. Musk or his lieutenants said the focus was largely on how to increase revenue.One product team is working on paid direct messaging, which appears to be focused on Very Important Tweeters, or V.I.T.s, on the network, said the two people with knowledge of the work and according to the internal documents. According to the product mock-ups seen by The Times, users would be able to send private messages to their favorite celebrities for a nominal fee. A fee structure, which had not been set in stone, could be as little as a few dollars per direct message.In early prototypes, a Twitter user was depicted asking the musician Post Malone about his favorite records. Such paid messages could appear in a special area of the direct message inbox, and the celebrities would have to choose to receive them. Twitter would most likely take a cut of the fees, according to the documents.The plans for paid direct messaging remain fluid, and there is no guarantee that the product will launch, the people with knowledge of the matter said.Product teams are also working on ""paywalled"" videos, an idea similar to offerings from platforms like OnlyFans, which hosts content for creators in the adult content industry. Under this plan, Twitter might ask users to pay a fee to watch a video, splitting the revenue with the creators who post the content, two people familiar with the project said.Mr. Musk has also shown interest in Vine, the looping video app that was popular among young creators before Twitter shut it down in 2016. He ran a Twitter poll on Sunday asking his followers whether or not he should bring it back, and he has commanded internal teams to examine the code to see if reviving it is possible, two people familiar with the conversations said.Mr. Musk's new Twitter Blue subscription service, which will give subscribers the check mark next to their username, is aiming to begin on Nov. 7 in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, according to internal documents seen by The Times. Subscribers would not need their identities authenticated to get the check mark, the documents suggested.The documents also noted that there would be ""an interim period where the check would be on both Blue subscribers accounts and previously verified users."" Eventually, verified accounts that do not pay for Twitter Blue will lose the check marks. There are more than 423,000 verified accounts on Twitter.The documents also outlined plans for ""government accounts to keep their Verified badge without paying for Blue."" Some features for the subscription service already announced by Mr. Musk, including higher rankings for subscribers' replies and the ability to upload longer videos, would not begin on Nov. 7, according to the documents. A European rollout was also planned, with the Twitter Blue team having worked to align the product with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation privacy law.The Blue team was told to get the product ready for introduction by next week or face being fired. Esther Crawford, one of the product managers, shared a photo of herself on Wednesday in a sleeping bag and wearing an eye mask on the floor of Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco.""When your team is pushing round the clock to make deadlines sometimes you #SleepWhereYouWork,"" she tweeted.Lauren Hirsch, Kate Conger and Tiffany Hsu contributed reporting.Lauren Hirsch, Kate Conger and Tiffany Hsu contributed reporting.PhotographLast year, Twitter had under $1 billion in cash flow, less money than what it now owes its lenders annually.

Twitter began widespread layoffs Friday as new owner Elon Musk overhauls the company, raising grave concerns about chaos enveloping the social media platform and its ability to fight disinformation just days ahead of the U.S. midterm elections.
The speed and size of the cuts also opened Musk and Twitter to lawsuits. At least one was filed alleging Twitter violated federal law by not providing fired employees the required notice.
The San Francisco-based company told workers by email Thursday that they would learn Friday if they had been laid off. About half of the company’s staff of 7,500 was let go, Yoel Roth, Twitter’s head of safety & integrity, confirmed in a tweet.
Musk tweeted late Friday that there was no choice but to cut the jobs “when the company is losing over $4M/day."" He did not provide details on the daily losses at the company and said employees who lost their jobs were offered three months' pay as a severance.
No other social media platform comes close to Twitter as a place where public agencies and other vital service providers — election boards, police departments, utilities, schools and news outlets — keep people reliably informed. Many fear Musk’s layoffs will gut it and render it lawless.
Roth said the company’s front-line moderation staff was the group the least impacted by the job cuts.
He added that Twitter’s “efforts on election integrity — including harmful misinformation that can suppress the vote and combatting state-backed information operations — remain a top priority.”
Musk, meanwhile, tweeted that “Twitter’s strong commitment to content moderation remains absolutely unchanged.”
But a Twitter employee who spoke with The Associated Press Friday said it will be a lot harder to get that work done starting next week after losing so many colleagues.
“This will impact our ability to provide support for elections, definitely,” said the employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concerns for job security.
The employee said there’s no “concrete sense of direction” except for what Musk says publicly on Twitter.
“I follow his tweets and they affect how we prioritize our work,” said the employee. “It’s a very healthy indicator of what to prioritize.”
Several employees who tweeted about losing their jobs said Twitter eliminated their entire teams, including one focused on human rights and global conflicts, another checking Twitter’s algorithms for bias in how tweets get amplified, and an engineering team devoted to making the social platform more accessible for people with disabilities.
Eddie Perez, a Twitter civic integrity team manager who quit in September, said he fears the layoffs so close to the midterms could allow disinformation to “spread like wildfire” during the post-election vote-counting period in particular.
“I have a hard time believing that it doesn’t have a material impact on their ability to manage the amount of disinformation out there,” he said, adding that there simply may not be enough employees to beat it back.
President Joe Biden, at a campaign event in Illinois Friday night, said: ""Now what are we all worried about? Elon Musk, who goes out and buys an outfit that sends and spews lies all across the world. ... How do we expect kids to be able to understand what is at stake?”
Twitter’s employees have been expecting layoffs since Musk took the helm. He fired top executives, including CEO Parag Agrawal, and removed the company's board of directors on his first day as owner.
As the emailed notices went out, many Twitter employees took to the platform to express support for each other — often simply tweeting blue heart emojis to signify its blue bird logo — and salute emojis in replies to each other.
A Twitter manager said many employees found out they had been laid off when they could no longer log into the company’s systems. The manager said the way the layoffs were conducted showed a “lack of care and thoughtfulness.” The manager, who spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity out of concerns for job security, said managers were not given any notice about who would be getting laid off.
“For me as a manager, it’s been excruciating because I had to find out about what my team was going to look like through tweets and through texting and calling people,” the employee said. “That’s a really hard way to care for your people. And managers at Twitter care a lot about their people.”
A coalition of civil rights groups escalated their calls Friday for brands to pause advertising buys on the platform. The layoffs are particularly dangerous ahead of the elections, the groups warned, and for transgender users and other groups facing violence inspired by hate speech that proliferates online.
In a tweet Friday, Musk blamed activists for what he described as a “massive drop in revenue” since he took over Twitter late last week.
Insider Intelligence analyst Jasmine Enberg said there is “little Musk can say to appease advertisers when he’s keeping the company in a constant state of uncertainty and turmoil, and appears indifferent to Twitter employees and the law.”
“Musk needs advertisers more than they need him,” she said. “Pulling ads from Twitter is a quick and painless decision for most brands.”
A lawsuit was filed Thursday in federal court in San Francisco on behalf of one employee who was laid off and three others who were locked out of their work accounts. It alleges Twitter violated the law by not providing the required notice.
The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification statute requires employers with at least 100 workers to disclose layoffs involving 500 or more employees, regardless of whether a company is publicly traded or privately held, as Twitter is now.
The layoffs affected Twitter's offices around the world. In the United Kingdom, it would be required by law to give employees notice, said Emma Bartlett, a partner specializing in employment and partnership law at CM Murray LLP.
The speed of the layoffs could also open Musk and Twitter up to discrimination claims if it turns out, for instance, that they disproportionally affected women, people of color or older workers.

425,6-Nov-22,Barron's (Online),"Love or Hate Him, Elon Musk Is About to Show Whether Twitter Can Take Flight",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2732360918/BFD812D457A14912PQ/244?accountid=13946,"Pioneer or poseur? Genius or jackass? Savior or threat? Elon Musk is America's new favorite wedge issue. And his acquisition of Twitter provides a riveting test.
The global town hall, as it's called, has always been a pitiful earner. And Musk, its biggest star, has paid top dollar for it, and then some. If he can remake Twitter into a platform whose prosperity matches its power, or into a thriving and respected public service, haters will find it difficult to dispute the man's product savvy and vision.
If Twitter nosedives, Musk will remain stratospherically rich—one doesn't amass $300 billion and then fall on hard times. But the mythos surrounding him, and perhaps even the sheen of his other businesses, could take a hit.
Brett Winton, who holds the title of chief futurist at ARK Investment Management, which now invests privately in Twitter and publicly in Tesla (ticker: TSLA), says that Musk's contribution to the future of self-driving cars has already secured his legacy. ""You could have everything else go up in flames, and I think he would still be seen as one of the most remarkable entrepreneurs and inventors of all time,"" he says.
Scott Galloway, an entrepreneur, venture capitalist, and marketing professor at New York University, says that ""the limousine liberal is now the Tesla owner,"" and that Musk is ""increasingly adopting a narrative that feels pretty far right, whether it's carrying the water of Xi or Putin."" Galloway has sold his Tesla vehicle. ""I don't like the man,"" he says.
Like we said: wedge issue. Ahead, we'll look at what a financially successful run for Musk at Twitter might look like, and its chances. We'll size up the outlook for Tesla, now a solid cash generator, with shares that are down 40% for the year. And we'll dance delicately around the culture war stuff but maybe jabber just a bit about the meaning of Musk.
Musk says his purpose in buying Twitter isn't to make money. Good thing. He might have just paid $44 billion for a business that would otherwise be trading now at less than half that value. Before Musk made his $54.20 offer in April, he had scooped up a big stake in Twitter shares. And before that, the stock was trading below $35.
Since then, online advertising trends, and the stock market's treatment of companies that rely on them, haven't been kind. Meta Platforms (META) has lost more than half of its value since mid-March. Snap (SNAP) is down by two-thirds . Even a milder one-third decline for Twitter, had Musk not come along, would have seen it valued now at barely $20 billion.
Revenue for Twitter this year was pegged at just over $5 billion before the deal closed and Wall Street analysts pulled their stock coverage and estimates. For Twitter to be worth such a high multiple of revenue, it would have to be fast-growing or exceptionally profitable. For now, it's neither.
Twitter's last quarterly report as a public company showed second-quarter revenue growing just 2% in constant currency. Management at the time blamed advertising industry headwinds and uncertainty related to the Musk takeover.
In an Oct. 27 tweet addressing advertisers, Musk wrote that the reason he bought Twitter was to ""help humanity, whom I love"" by promoting healthy debate at a time when traditional media has ""fueled and catered to...polarized extremes."" Twitter, he wrote, ""obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!""
Three days later, Musk tweeted a baseless claim by a conspiracy website that an attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband was the result of a lover's quarrel. Hours later, the tweet disappeared without comment from Musk. So, let's call brand safety a work in progress.
""Twitter has had a massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers, even though nothing has changed with content moderation,"" Musk tweeted on Friday. Another explanation is the surge in racial slurs on Twitter following the takeover—companies will want to see how Musk can protect their brands from appearing next to objectionable content.
A revenue downturn would hit at an inopportune time. The deal has left Twitter with $13 billion in debt. Incremental interest could total $700 million over the next year, give or take, says MKM Partners analyst Rohit Kulkarni, who covered Twitter as a public company. Assuming a $300,000 all-in cost per employee, Twitter would need to lay off perhaps 2,500 workers, or a third of its staff, just to keep recent operating losses from growing, he says.
Musk, who has already let go top Twitter leadership, has begun laying off other workers.
But what about growth? Paid subscriptions, recently less than 9% of total revenue, are the likeliest lane for now. There's already a $4.99 a month service called Twitter Blue with a thin list of premium features, like the ability to undo a tweet before others see it.
Musk floated the idea of charging $20 a month for verified or ""blue check mark"" status. When the novelist Stephen King tweeted a colorfully worded no vote and threatened to leave the platform, Musk replied, ""How about $8?"" When New York Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez chided Musk on Twitter for ""selling"" free speech for $8 a month, he replied, ""Your feedback is appreciated. Now pay $8.""
Based on the new boss' latest trail of Twitter clues, a blue-check subscription would probably come with fewer ads and priority placement in stacks of replies and search results, which would help combat scams and bots.
Don't count out demand. ARK's Winton calls the current verification system subjective, like a ""modern knighthood or something,"" and says the new subscription plan would clean up misbehavior and expand the pool of verified users, allowing for new types of transactions, perhaps with cryptocurrency. This is the so-called super-app theory—that Twitter can be far more than tweets.
MKM's Kulkarni says that a super app like China's Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) has would be ""significantly harder, in my opinion, to bring together, particularly in the Western world."" Twitter should instead focus on moving beyond its past of ""significant mismanagement"" and ""underappreciated potential"" by tackling misinformation, simplifying the user experience, and growing its customer base to begin taking meaningful market share in advertising.
""If things go well and if they clean up their act, probably that is a multibagger situation,"" says Kulkarni, referring to the prospect of Musk bringing Twitter public again in the future for a multiple of the price he paid. ""There's not going to be another Twitter in the world.""
NYU's Galloway says that Musk would have to multiply what is probably Twitter's true value today just to break even on the price he paid, which he calls a ""tough one."" But he also points to Twitter's untapped value to many of its users, who can get paid thousands of dollars for a promoted tweet. ""I don't see why they would be out of line to take the Apple route and say we want 30% of that.""
Retaining key talent and big tweeters while soothing advertisers will be key. Laura Huang, who teaches management and entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School, isn't put off by Musk's manner. ""He's a jarring person,"" she says. ""There's no way to not offend anyone in a situation like this."" Huang calls Musk a ""master of A-B testing"" and says that some of his comments are just ""testing different things that he could be putting into place.""
There's an awkward reality here about politics and profits. If Musk is indeed moving to the right, that's his business. If he's doing so in smash-mouth style, same. But 32% of U.S. adults who lean Democrat say they use Twitter, which is 15 points higher than those who lean Republican, according to Pew Research. Electric vehicles aren't just for lefty greens, but surveys suggest a similar skew there. Perception here matters at least as much as reality; it can't be good for business if a meaningful portion of customers comes to believe that the owner is trolling them.
Tesla's stock market value, recently near $680 billion, has long dwarfed those of legacy car makers like Ford Motor (F), about $53 billion, and General Motors (GM), $55 billion. Now, Tesla is pulling ahead on moneymaking, too. Next year, its free cash flow could total $14.6 billion, according to analysts polled by FactSet, compared with Ford's $4.1 billion and $5.9 billion for GM.
The outlook from here for Tesla depends greatly on whether one views it as a software platform with an insurmountable lead or as a manufacturer that puts metal on wheels. That difference explains why the bull and bear cases could hardly be further apart.
ARK's Winton predicts that self-driving taxis will deliver $26 trillion in incremental gross domestic product by 2030, and be ""the most macroeconomically impactful innovation ever brought to bear on humanity""—counting the steam engine. Tesla, he says, will command a majority of this market, or at least the leading share.
NYU's Galloway, meanwhile, calls Tesla ""the most overvalued stock in the world."" He compares it to Netflix (NFLX), which faced limited competition in streaming for years, and now is struggling to grow.
Tesla and Netflix are similar in another way. Both soared in value during a decade of near-zero interest rates, and all that stock market value allowed for aggressive cash burn rates without creditors getting spooked. Both companies are now well over the hump financially. But growth stocks aren't worshiped quite the same now that savers can get a few percent on safe money.
There's a well-worn Twitter meme featuring a theatergoer excitedly munching popcorn. It means that the tweet it's attached to is sure to launch a fun-to-watch flame war in the replies. We're all good for now on online high jinks. Here's hoping the next plot twist features robots or rockets instead.

426,7-Nov-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla Stock Succumbed to Elon Musk's Latest Tweet. Investors Need to Watch Out.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2732561131/BFD812D457A14912PQ/61?accountid=13946,"Tesla stock fell again Monday—and shares have dropped below a key level that suggests more downside could be ahead.
Tesla stock (ticker: TSLA) is coming off a brutal Friday . The stock opened higher to start the new week—up 0.7% at $208.90—before falling 5% to $197.08. The S&P 500 closed up 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 1.3%. The key level is $200, the price that the stock has held through a laundry list of problems for the electric vehicle pioneer: weaker-than-expected third-quarter deliveries, more delays at its Shanghai plant because of China's zero-Covid policy, rising interest rates, weakening consumer demand, and price cuts—again in China. And as important—or maybe more important—than the stock's sheer resilience is the stock price's effect on traders, who pay a lot of attention to chart patterns and stock support levels. Any breakdown below a key level will be jumped on by traders looking to profit from trends.
In the case of Tesla, falling below $200 a share essentially completes the end of a head-and-shoulders pattern—a stock chart that looks like a person shrugging their shoulders. At the start of the pattern, the stock is moving higher and declines—a shrug. The head is a new high and then the stock forms the other shrug. When the last shrug is finished, the stock could have a long way to fall.
Fairlead Strategies founder Katie Stockton believes if the stock breaks $200, then the next key level is about $180 a share. After that, 22V Research technical strategist John Roque says that $100 if there is more fundamental bad news—about the economy or the company.
Traders watch for patterns that work—and that give insight into investor sentiment. Fundamentals don't matter as much to them. They have lots of ways to make money in the stock market.
Fundamentally, the weakness in Tesla stock has to be blamed on Twitter . More specifically, the weakness has to be blamed on Elon Musk, who now runs both companies.
Confusion has reigned at the social media platform since the billionaire became owner and chief executive in late October. He has slashed the workforce and fought with high-profile users like bestselling author Stephen King. A big consequence of all the instability: Advertisers have pulled back on their spending.
Musk also tweeted about, and then deleted, a conspiracy theory about the assault on Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi. And Monday morning, Musk endorsed voting for Republican candidates in the midterm elections at 10:22 a.m.
Tesla stock dropped as low as $197.11 from above $200 shortly after the tweet even as the market remained flat. The market gained over the course of the day while Tesla stock closed near its low.
What's affecting Musk seems to be impacting Tesla. Musk is vital to the Tesla brand—and any bad PR attached to Musk is rubbing off on Tesla.
A recession is possible, and that would hit consumer demand for Teslas. And who knows how Covid and price cuts will shake out in China.
But there is one variable that can stop, or at least slow, the Tesla stock slide: Elon Musk needs to get in a lane, in his management of Twitter—and stay there, driving the speed limit.

 Tesla Stock Succumbed to Elon Musk's Latest Tweet. Investors Need to Watch Out.

427,7-Nov-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Why Elon Musk's Quest to Revive Twitter Is Likely to Fail; Musk's strategy at Twitter might work at a startup, but Twitter is a mature company in an extremely competitive market, with little prospects for growth",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2732633813/BFD812D457A14912PQ/240?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk is treating Twitter like a startup. The thing about startups is, most of them fail.
At Twitter, as is typical at tech startups, Mr. Musk is making or has promised to make a great many changes quickly . This makes a lot of sense when a company is small and burning investor cash. Few operators in tech are as familiar with this well-worn playbook as Mr. Musk, who is almost unrivaled among entrepreneurs in the total market value of all the companies he has helmed or helped found—including SpaceX, Tesla and PayPal.
But Twitter isn't a startup, it's a mature company with a lot that Mr. Musk could squander if he moves too quickly and breaks too many things at once. Twitter has thousands of employees, even after the company announced significant layoffs on Friday, a mountain of code with all the technical debt that implies, about $5 billion in annual revenue, and nearly 240 million daily active users with strong opinions about the service. Also unlike a startup, it has more than $1 billion in annual debt payments , on top of other expenses, thanks to the money Mr. Musk borrowed to help fund his takeover.
Twitter is already threatened with what could become an existential crisis, as Mr. Musk tweeted Friday that the company has suffered ""a massive drop in revenue "" as advertisers pause their spending on the site, wary of what Mr. Musk will do next and how it could reflect on them.
While Mr. Musk has in the past accomplished what many deemed impossible, Twitter is a completely different sort of challenge than he has dealt with before. His often-touted ""first principles"" thinking is great for creating new physical products. But he has demonstrated something like the opposite of a talent for the extremely tricky diplomacy required to run a social network, where a leader must balance the needs and desires of advertisers and users, not to mention regulators and politicians. All this, while overseeing what amount to editorial decisions about what content is and isn't allowed.
Mark Zuckerberg has compared the experience of running a giant social network to waking up every day and "" getting punched in the stomach ."" In his typically jovial and combative style, Mr. Musk's response to that reality has been to punch back—on Twitter. His actions are spooking advertisers , who correctly recognize that the behavior of the head of a social network is an implicit model of how everyone else on the site is allowed to behave.
The bull case for Twitter under Mr. Musk, which isn't easily dismissed, starts with the judgment that the company has long punched under its weight—a popular platform whose true potential has been stifled by uninspired leadership, moribund innovation, and the way public ownership focuses attention on quarterly results. Mr. Musk, his backers believe, offers just the right kind of outside-the-box thinking and willingness to experiment that can unlock Twitter's potential, making it a more valuable tool to more people.
Mr. Musk's vision for Twitter has drawn the financial support of a string of big banks that lent him $13 billion, and a group of big-name investors who committed another $7 billion in equity. ""As we looked at the opportunity, there are just many things that can be improved in the way that Twitter serves its users, whether that's in the product itself, or in the monetization model,"" said Roelof Botha , the head of Sequoia Capital, the storied venture firm that committed $800 million to Mr. Musk's takeover.

Outside developers who have worked with Twitter for years also believe the company could significantly increase its revenue, if its new leaders are thoughtful about what new products and opportunities they pursue. Tracy Chou, CEO of Block Party, a service that helps Twitter users filter their feeds, says that ""It's possible Twitter could quintuple in size and revenue, but they need to execute against that intelligently.""
In a recent essay , Turner Novak, a venture capitalist who isn't part of the Twitter deal, summarized the optimistic case for Twitter under Mr. Musk. But Mr. Novak also says that by the numbers, the deal seems to be not a very good one for Musk and his backers.
First, Musk-owned Twitter is starting in a deep financial hole. The billionaire agreed on a price in April amid a tech-market rout that has only worsened since, especially for social-media stocks. Rivals Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, and Snap, which owns Snapchat, are currently valued around two-to-three times last year's revenue. The $44 billion Mr. Musk paid for Twitter amounts to nearly nine times its 2021 sales.
And the interest on the debt to finance the takeover will make it harder to turn a profit—something Twitter has long struggled to do consistently—that might justify a lofty price.
On top of that, given how crowded the social media space is already, it's not clear anyone, even Elon Musk, can turn Twitter into a company that grows quickly—or at all. The bear case for Twitter is, therefore, that ""Twitter is sort of a stagnant and troubled business that just took on a ton of debt,"" says Mr. Novak.
Of course, ""troubled business that just took on a ton of debt"" could also describe Tesla and SpaceX at various points in the past. Those companies and Twitter are all ""tech"" companies in that they all require a lot of programmers and code. But social networks are only nominally in the same business-school case study universe as companies that build rockets or cars. And Mr. Musk's prior successes were largely about wrestling with immutable laws of physics and materials science, while running a social network is about managing humans, whose behavior is infinitely more complicated and difficult to predict.
Take content moderation, something Mr. Musk was vocal about changing at Twitter, in favor of looser rules. In his first week or so at the helm, Mr. Musk already has been confronting the complexities of this issue . In the face of backlash from advertisers and various advocacy organizations, some of Mr. Musk's most recent comments suggest he won't be changing as much about content moderation at Twitter as he had once promised .
What about Mr. Musk's more long-term and audacious plans for Twitter? He has said that he wants to turn it into X, the ""everything app."" To most people in tech, this is known as a ""super app,"" such as WeChat in China. I have written about whether a super app could succeed in the West . To summarize: The odds aren't great, for the simple reason that many of the functions—communications, shopping, payments—are already quite capably handled by countless other apps and their behemoth backers.
In the meantime, Mr. Musk has hinted at preliminary plans to create a new subscription service for Twitter . Mr. Musk has also tweeted about possibly reviving, in some form, Twitter's defunct short-form video product, Vine, which pioneered the genre but which Twitter's leaders killed off in 2016. Given that TikTok has since used a similar format to become a globe-spanning social media titan, and that many of the most popular tweets are just reposts of TikTok videos, adding this medium to Twitter is a logical thing to try.
Even if these ambitious plans work, it's hard to see them making much difference to Twitter's bottom line. If, say, 1% of Twitter's approximately 240 million current daily active users were to opt for this subscription service, that's $230 million a year in revenue. That's less than 5% of Twitter's $5 billion in 2021 revenue, about 90% of which came from advertising .
Share Your Thoughts
What direction will Elon Musk take Twitter? Join the conversation below.
In a best-case scenario, if Twitter were to leverage new products to quadruple its user base to about a billion daily active users—something Mr. Musk has said was his goal, in a leaked slide deck on his plans for the company—and 5% of those users were to opt for such a service, it would mean $4.8 billion a year in revenue. That could be a big bump for Twitter. But it's worth noting that the history of asking people to pay for access to social networks has seen many attempts, and no company has achieved anywhere near this scale .
As he does all this, Mr. Musk must balance the risk of alienating current users faster than he attracts new ones. The past week has seen prominent users of the site, including many celebrities, declare they have or will abandon it.
 It's possible Twitter's current user numbers and levels of engagement have both peaked. In which case, Twitter's high water mark was an unintended consequence of years of stasis in the product. Through its steadfast refusal to attempt to keep up with the times, in the form of new mediums like video, Twitter managed to remain the lowest-effort, highest-impact place for politicians, media types, and anyone seeking a megaphone to reach the biggest audience possible.
In April, at a TED conference , Mr. Musk said of Twitter that ""This is not a way to sort of make money. My strong intuitive sense is that having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization. I don't care about the economics at all.""
 In May , after the value of Tesla dropped 29% and a broader stock market selloff of tech companies had begun, Mr. Musk tweeted that the deal for Twitter was ""on hold."" By July , he officially sought to get out of it. Mr. Musk has always insisted this was about Twitter not being truthful about the number of fake and spam accounts on the service.
But it's hard not to conclude that after extensive discussions with leaders at the company, Mr. Musk himself finally woke up to the present and future economics of Twitter—and didn't like what he saw.

 Why Elon Musk's Quest to Revive Twitter Is Likely to Fail

428,7-Nov-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Needs the One Kind of Executive He Doesn't Have,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2732673408/BFD812D457A14912PQ/270?accountid=13946,"
Elon Musk needs a kind of executive that he just hasn't had much use for historically. He needs a marketing and public-relations person he can trust. If Musk fails to adjust, there could be more pain on the way for Tesla shareholders.
Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock is down about 12% since Musk took over Twitter. That span, of course, includes hawkish comments from Fed chairman Jerome Powell about the magnitude and speed of interest-rate hikes. But the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are down only about 1% and 3%, respectively over the same span. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up almost 2%.
Something else is vexing Tesla investors. It isn't the fact Musk is running another company. Analyst and investors just don't appear all that worried about the distraction issue. ""Distraction risk is less worrisome today than a few years ago, given that Tesla is profitable going concern,"" says Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi . ""His involvement in day-to-day operations is less pressing.
He isn't worried about distraction despite being bearish on Tesla stock. Sacconaghi rates Tesla stock at Sell with a $150 price target.
His sentiment is echoed by others who feel comfortable with Tesla's depth of managerial and engineering talent. But Musk doesn't need only engineers to fix Twitter software algorithms. He needs marketing and public-relations people.
Last last week Musk decried a revenue drop after advertisers paused spending on the Twitter platform following his takeover. He blamed activist groups pressuring advertisers ""Extremely messed up!"" tweeted Musk on Friday. ""They're trying to destroy free speech in America.""
There are alternative explanations for the advertising pause though. Brands don't like to be associated with things seen as negative or chaotic, says Future Fund Active ETF (FFND) co-founder Gary Black .
Before coming to Wall Street, Black says he worked in marketing. ""Advertisers are like portfolio managers. They hate noise,"" says Black adding ""threatening advertisers, and letting them watch this drama play out in public will cause more advertisers to leave.""
Black isn't invested in Twitter—but some other investors have privately invested in Twitter after Musk's acquisition. But Tesla is one of the largest positions in Black's fund. He cares about any brand taint to Tesla resulting from things that happen at Twitter.
Gerber Kawasaki Wealth Management CEO Ross Gerber owns Tesla stock and still is an investor in Twitter. He believes that Musk will be successful, but acknowledges that media is ""100% different skill set"" than Tesla's CEO currently has.
Failing to acquire media savvy is the biggest risk to his Twitter investment, Gerber says. ""As smart as you are, you can't make yourself [emotionally intelligent] when you only have IQ.""
Musk is more of an engineer than ad executive. Of course, he doesn't have to morph into a ""Mad Men"" character. He can hire people he trusts with the required media skills. He should probably do that fast—and then start listening to them.
Whether Musk will or not is anyone's guess. Journalists know that Tesla hasn't had much use for PR staff. All of Barron's inquiries to Tesla PR have gone unanswered over the past couple of years. Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment about its PR plans in the wake of Musk taking over Twitter.
If Musk is going to change his attitude about PR, the sooner the better. Tesla shares fell about $3 on Tuesday morning, shortly after Musk endorsed voting for Republican House of Representative candidates in the Midterm elections. The market was flat over the same span.
Musk wading directly into politics as the head of a social-media platform is new noise for Tesla investors. And investors hate noise.

Tesla stock dropped as low as $197.11 from above $200 shortly after the tweet even as the market remained flat. The market gained over the course of the day while Tesla stock closed near its low.
Since then Musk has also responded to tweets about left activists groups as well as saying that Twitter's mission is ""to become by far the most accurate source of information about the world."" That hasn't changed perceptions of what's happening at Twitter, which appears to be affecting musk. And what's affecting Musk seems to be impacting Tesla, as well. Musk is vital to the Tesla brand—and any bad PR attached to Musk is rubbing off on Tesla.
The Twitter drama comes at a bad time for Twitter. A recession in the U.S. is possible, and that would hit consumer demand for Teslas. And who knows how Covid and price cuts will shake out in China.
But there is one variable that can stop, or at least slow, the Tesla stock slide: Elon Musk needs to get in a lane at Twitter—and stay there—while driving the speed limit.
Is that too much to ask?

 Tesla Stock Succumbed to Elon Musk's Latest Tweets. Investors Need to Watch Out.

430,8-Nov-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Tesla Has a Twitter Problem --- Car maker's shareholders face risk that operations could be held hostage to social-media politics,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2732954522/BFD812D457A14912PQ/138?accountid=13946,"[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Tesla already had a treacherous line to walk between China and the U.S. Chief Executive Elon Musk made it worse by buying Twitter.
The electric-vehicle pioneer is hugely reliant on China. The world's largest EV market accounted for about 24% of Tesla's revenue in the first three quarters of this year, but the company's bigger dependence is in production. The Shanghai plant is its largest manufacturing and export hub, with room to make more than 750,000 Model 3s or Model Y's -- roughly two-fifths of its global capacity. Not coincidentally, the rise of this factory mirrored the increase in Tesla's margins over the past couple of years. The company needs China's battery materials: It gets lithium compounds from Chinese suppliers Ganfeng and Yahua.
The relationship has long made Tesla among the global companies most vulnerable to rising geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China. Although German peers such as BMW and Volkswagen make a disproportionate share of profits in the country -- perhaps as much as 50% -- Tesla is unique in fully owning its Chinese operation. This arrangement gives it an incentive to use its Shanghai base for exports on a scale none of its peers do.
Tesla is working hard to diversify its global footprint by building up production capacity in Germany and Texas and alternative sources of lithium supplies, including in North America. But its growth is such that it won't be able to function without substantial inputs from China for the foreseeable future -- a problem it shares with the wider EV industry.
Tesla's dependence on the country is in a league perhaps only with Apple, whose market value Mr. Musk likes to compare with Tesla's. Apple CEO Tim Cook generally avoids politics. The same goes for the German car makers, which scrupulously avoid taking political positions beyond a general support of ""global trade."" VW regularly bats away questions, including from within its supervisory board, about the appropriateness of having a factory in Xinjiang, where human-rights groups raised concerns about labor abuses.
Mr. Musk has used political statements to curry favor with Beijing, most recently by implying that Taiwan should be part of China. This game will likely get a lot harder now that he is running Twitter. For example, if he continues with the social-media platform's efforts to close down Chinese networks that tweet about U.S. elections, he might find himself less welcome with Chinese authorities. If he doesn't, Washington will plainly object.
One concrete example of the risk came in the form of a tweet from Hu Xijin, a prominent former newspaper editor whose Twitter handle is labeled ""China state-affiliated media,"" with a link to a page explaining why the social-media platform believes ""people benefit from additional context when interacting with Chinese government and state-affiliated accounts."" Mr. Hu said he hoped the label would be removed now that Mr. Musk was running Twitter. How the new CEO responds to such requests will be a minefield.
Tesla has been a rare bright spot among Western brands in China this year, with its local revenues up about 50%. Others are struggling: The share of global brands in Chinese vehicle production has fallen to 47%, from 54% in 2019, according to forecasting firm LMC Automotive. The Stellantis joint venture that made the Jeep brand in China is filing for bankruptcy. Some see the visible hand of the Chinese government behind this trend and the parallel rise of companies such as BYD, one of the world's most valuable auto makers.
To be sure, there are valid reasons why Tesla is outperforming its peers in China, starting with its exclusive focus on the fast-growing EV category, where many Western brands are weaker than Chinese ones. But Mr. Musk's amicable relations with the Chinese Communist Party, which has a history of steering consumer tastes, can't hurt. A big question for Tesla investors is how adroitly he can maintain them while pursuing his goal of improving ""free speech"" at Twitter -- a social-media platform blocked for most users in China precisely because that is what it offers.

431,8-Nov-22,The Washington Post,"Musk recommends voting GOP, suspends Twitter accounts for 'impersonation'",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2732909689/BFD812D457A14912PQ/353?accountid=13946,"New Twitter owner Elon Musk tweeted Monday encouraging ""independent-minded voters"" to vote Republican, marking a major departure for leaders of social media companies, who typically steer clear of partisan political advocacy.
""Shared power curbs the worst excesses of both parties, therefore I recommend voting for a Republican Congress, given that the Presidency is Democratic,"" he tweeted.
The remark capped a chaotic weekend in which Musk abruptly changed course on several major issues for the company, which he acquired for $44 billion a little over a week ago. After laying off about half of the workforce on Friday, Twitter began scrambling to rehire some who were let go. It postponed the planned launch of its new paid verification product until after the midterm elections.
And it suspended popular accounts for impersonating Musk, under a policy that the company's new CEO announced Sunday.
Musk's endorsement of GOP candidates to his 115 million Twitter followers, a day before midterm elections, is likely to intensify the partisan divide over his takeover of the platform. Lawmakers in the past have grilled executives of social media companies including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube as to whether their decisions could have influenced election outcomes, even as those executives have studiously avoided signaling their preferences for a given party or candidate.
Musk has shown himself to be an outspoken and occasionally erratic CEO, prone to outbursts - sometimes in public forums such as earnings calls. Meanwhile his public pronouncements on Tesla have at times broken well-understood norms, such as the expectation that company leaders withhold comment on market-moving matters during the trading day.
""Tesla stock price is too high imo,"" he declared in one tweet - sending the stock plunging. Musk tweeted in 2018 that he had ""Funding secured"" to take Tesla private for $420 per share, leading the Securities and Exchange Commission to accuse him of misleading investors. Musk and Tesla each agreed to pay $20 million fines in the ordeal, and Musk relinquished his board chairmanship of Tesla in the settlement.
But Musk's shoot-from-the-hip ethos carries new gravity as he runs Twitter, a highly influential forum where millions seek out news, election information and communications from world leaders. As Musk's interest in owning Twitter was becoming apparent, he said Twitter serves as a ""de facto public town square,"" and should adhere to principles of free speech, doing little beyond what the law explicitly requires to police itself.
His endorsement in the elections as the CEO of a massively influential social media site shines a new light on how he plans to execute that vision.
Musk's endorsement of Republicans may come as a surprise to some, but he has been expressing disdain for the direction of the Democratic Party in recent years. In April, he wrote that he strongly supported Obama for president, but that the party had been ""hijacked by extremists.""
""I support free speech, but not any one candidate. In fact, I gave money to & voted for Hillary & then voted for Biden,"" he tweeted in May. ""However, given unprovoked attacks by leading Democrats against me & a very cold shoulder to Tesla & SpaceX, I intend to vote Republican.""
Musk had expressed frustration with California's government amid shelter-in-place orders during coronavirus restrictions in 2020, as Tesla's factory there was closed. In May of that year, he defiantly reopened Tesla's plant - accepting the support of President Donald Trump in his push to break with county-level stay-at-home orders. Musk broke into a profanity-laced rant during a Tesla earnings call around the time, calling quarantine measures ""fascist.""
Musk's sudden, dramatic moves energized some on the right, who view Musk as reversing Twitter's leftward shift under previous leadership. And it kept many users glued to Twitter, where his follower count continued to grow rapidly over the weekend.
Musk said Friday that Twitter has seen a ""massive drop in revenue, due to activist groups pressuring advertisers"" to stop advertising on the platform.
Researchers saw early signs that the conversation on Twitter was already changing in the first week of Musk's ownership, as conspiracy theorists appeared emboldened by his promises of a hands-off approach to policing the platform.
In Musk's first five days of ownership of Twitter, posts from accounts related to the baseless pro-Trump conspiracy theory QAnon nearly doubled according to the nonprofit Advance Democracy, which conducts public interest research. And tweets casting doubt on U.S. elections were receiving thousands of retweets and no labels, the research found.
Musk sought to quell the concerns of advertisers, but the issue ballooned as he chose to conduct large-scale layoffs in the run-up to the midterm elections, prompting fears about how the platform would be policed. It hadn't helped that Musk himself, days after taking ownership of the site, shared a post containing misinformation about the attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, Paul Pelosi. Musk tweeted, then deleted, a post linking to a conspiracy theory-laden article from the Santa Monica Observer, described by fact-checkers as a low-credibility source favoring the extreme right.
Some advertisers chose to express caution as Twitter entered the era of Musk's ownership.
Companies including General Motors, Volkswagen Group and General Mills all said they were pausing advertising on Twitter. Meanwhile civil rights groups called for an advertiser boycott, with NAACP President Derrick Johnson saying, ""It is immoral, dangerous, and highly destructive to our democracy for any advertiser to fund a platform that fuels hate speech, election denialism, and conspiracy theories.""
Under financial pressure to turn the company around quickly, Musk has been touting a plan to charge users $8 per month to get verified and receive a check mark testifying to their account's authenticity, among other benefits. Musk initially promised that the new subscription plan, known as Twitter Blue, would launch Monday, and there was widespread confusion Saturday about whether the feature was launching.
But a person familiar with the plans, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal plans, told The Washington Post the launch will not happen until after the midterms. The New York Times first reported the delay.
The company began reaching out over the weekend to try to rehire employees it had just laid off, according to multiple internal sources, including two with direct knowledge of the rehiring efforts who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. Among the people Twitter is said to be seeking to rehire are engineers who worked on the company's Android app, members of its Cortex machine-learning team, and others with specific technical expertise needed to launch new products, sources told The Post. The attempt to bring back laid-off employees was first reported by Platformer on Friday.
""They're asking people to come back because a lot of things are breaking there,"" said one laid-off Twitter employee who was asked about their interest in returning to the company. A few teams ""were completely eliminated without much thought and now it's causing roadblocks for other teams. It's been a frustrating week for those employed, too.""
The employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters, told The Post they planned to decline the offer to return.
Generating some of the most controversy, Twitter started suspending accounts ""engaged in impersonation"" on Sunday after Musk announced that all accounts falsely using the names of real people without a ""parody"" label would be immediately banned from the platform. 
The move came after a flood of users changed their display names to match Musk's - many of whom jeered his announcement that Twitter would soon charge users $8 per month for verification.
""Going forward, any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying 'parody' will be permanently suspended,"" Musk tweeted Sunday afternoon.
The new impersonation policy appeared to contradict Musk's assurance last week that he would convene a ""content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints"" before making any major decisions. In May, Musk criticized permanent suspensions, saying that they ""fundamentally undermine trust in Twitter.""
Musk had also previously indicated he would reinstate permanently suspended accounts such as that of Trump, who was banned after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol under Twitter's policies against inciting violence. But last week he said the company would not bring back Trump or other banned accounts before the midterms.
Among those suspended from Twitter for changing their display names to ""Elon Musk"" was comedian Kathy Griffin, who, under Musk's moniker, urged Americans to vote for Democrats in the midterm elections.
Griffin's fans called Twitter's move a crackdown on freedom of speech and parody, using the hashtag #freekathy to criticize the platform's new policy. Later on Sunday, Musk, who is the world's richest person, tweeted that Griffin could have her account back if she paid up.
""If she really wants her account back, she can have it,"" Musk wrote. ""For $8.""

432,8-Nov-22,The Washington Post,The real tragedy of Elon Musk's Twitter deal,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2732909746/BFD812D457A14912PQ/495?accountid=13946,"Whatever Elon Musk thinks he's trying to do with Twitter isn't rocket science. Apparently, it's much harder.
The powerful boosters made by Musk's company SpaceX can propel humans and cargo into orbit and then, instead of tumbling chaotically to earth, land gracefully upright like a ballerina completing a jeté. But in trying to run a social media platform, Musk seems lost in space. That's bad for Twitter users - and even worse for a world that could benefit from Musk's undivided attention to tasks that really matter.
The planet's wealthiest individual is doing other astounding things. His car company, Tesla, has revolutionized transportation by jump-starting the market for electric cars. The advances in battery technology he pushed his team to achieve made that leap possible.
The company's work on batteries isn't limited to cars: Tesla sells solar panels that look and act like shingles paired with batteries that can back up homes for days in case of prolonged power outages.
Not all of Musk's moonshots are as close to reality. Like Post owner and fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos, Musk believes we must and will send humans to colonize Mars. And Musk's Neuralink corporation dreams of engineering an interface between computers and the human brain.
And there are already signs that Musk is spreading himself too thin. His Boring Company staked a long-shot bet on super-high-speed transportation by whooshing vehicles through underground tubes. But the company just demolished a major California prototype.
It's bad enough to think that the so-called Hyperloop was sacrificed to Musk's other enthusiasms and distractions. But to give up the future for Twitter?
In the days since Musk took the platform private, his only innovation has been to set a new standard for zaniness and dysfunction in corporate governance.
If Musk gives the impression that he spent $44 billion to indulge an addictive, destructive hobby, he at least claims to have a higher purpose: to preserve ""a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence.""
Even if that's true, Musk hasn't much shown that he's up to the task.
He has lurched from grand pronouncements about free speech, to trying to placate advertisers, to pouting about big companies' unwillingness to be associated with his chaos. Musk fired roughly half of Twitter's workforce only to belatedly decide some of his ex-employees were critical to his plans. And his decision to tweet, then delete, a link to a vile and false conspiracy-theory narrative about the vicious hammer attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's 82-year-old husband, Paul, is not exactly a model for a sane public arena.
Adding to the challenges of Musk's erratic personality is the debt he assumed to buy Twitter. His most significant move has been to monetize the site's verification system. That's a rational economic move, but one that cuts against his efforts to create a healthier forum for debate by opening the door to new kinds of impersonation and deception.
All these disasters have been almost as entertaining as they have been horrifying. Musk isn't wrong that, when it's firing on all cylinders, ""Twitter is simply the most interesting place on the internet.""
But they also distract from a larger question about whether, even under the best conditions, trying to fulfill Musk's highest aspirations for Twitter is the worthiest use of his time. Is a single, freewheeling debate forum meant to accommodate the sheer variety of opinion inevitable among billions of people useful, much less possible? And is it more useful than the things Musk has already demonstrated that he can pull off?
I might not like Musk's libertarian bro schtick, and his management style looks simply appalling. But he has a track record of doing things that seemed impossible.
Tesla matters not merely because of the technical achievements involved in making the cars but because Musk managed to make a clean technology desirable. Given the dour, killjoy reputation the environmental movement is unfairly saddled with, that's a generational achievement - and one that could prove a critical inflection point for big corporations and consumer behavior alike.
And if Musk is serious in his belief that humanity needs an escape hatch, why not focus exclusively on getting us to Mars? There are plenty of people working on fostering healthier civic spaces but only a very few running successful commercial space companies.
Abandoning the future of humanity for the sake of blue check marks is a comedown for Musk - and for the rest of us.

433,9-Nov-22,USA Today (Online),Elon Musk's net worth cut nearly in half as Tesla stock prices dive,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2734332726/BFD812D457A14912PQ/38?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has seen his net worth nearly cut in half from last year's peak. Here's some numbers that illustrate what's going on with the fortune of the (still) richest person on Earth.  $177 billion Musk's net worth has fallen to $177 billion after reaching a peak of $340 billion last year, according to Bloomberg.  According to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, Musk is still the richest person in the world, ahead of Amazon's Jeff Bezos whose net worth is listed at $113 billion.  53% Tesla, Musk's electric vehicle company, has seen its stock plunge 53% this year, wiping out about $600 billion in market capitalization, according to Markets Insider. Shares when from $30 at the start of 2020 to a peak of $410 last November. Tesla stock opened at $190 on Wednesday morning with a market capitalization of $582 billion.  TWITTER UPDATES: Musk walks back Twitter layoffs, Kathy Griffin suspended 3,700 One of Musk's first moves after purchasing Twitter for $44 billion on Oct. 27 was to announce massive layoffs. Those cuts took place Friday with 3,700 out of about 7,500 employees being laid off.  Twitter wasn't the only tech company laying off workers this month. Meta, Snapchat and Netflix also laid off workers while Amazon imposed a hiring freeze.  $4 million per day That's how much Musk said Twitter was losing as of Friday, a week after he purchased the company. He blamed the loss of revenue on ""activist groups pressuring advertisers"" over content moderation concerns. Some advertisers have paused ad purchases on the platform, including General Motors, Pfizer, Volkswagen, and Jeep maker Stellantis NV, according to reports from the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg.  'A MASSIVE DROP IN REVENUE': Musk blames activists for Twitter's woes amid mass layoffs Musk held a ""Twitter spaces"" conversation Wednesday in order to speak to advertiser concerns which had more than 95,000 listeners about a half hour in. “I don't think having hate speech next to an ad is great,"" Musk said. This came days after he threatened a “thermonuclear name & shame” campaign against any advertisers that leave the site.  Is Elon Musk selling Tesla stock? Most of Musk's net worth is tied to Tesla stock, which as noted, has plunged in value this year. He's also sold off about $36 billion in Tesla stock over the past year, according to Reuters, including 19.5 million shares valued at just under $4 billion between last Friday and Tuesday U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings show.  Tesla investors may fear Musk has become less focused on the automaker as he spends time on the Twitter deal, both Bloomberg and Market Insider reported.  They also may be anticipating him selling more shares to finance that purchase, which could drag down Tesla's stock price further.

434,9-Nov-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Keeps Selling Tesla Stock. Investors Are Too.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2734360447/BFD812D457A14912PQ/78?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk sold Tesla stock on Friday, Monday, and Tuesday . Investors were following his lead on Wednesday.
Although the stock (ticker: TSLA) traded higher at points early in the day, the gains didn't hold. Shares closed down down— again —at $177.59 for a loss of 7.3%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.1% and 2%, respectively. It has been a brutal stretch for Tesla stock. If shares end the day at the current level, it would be the lowest close in almost two years, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Shares closed at $173.95 on Nov. 23, 2020. So far this month, the shares are down roughly 30% for the month and are down almost 60% below their record high of $409.97. The drop has wiped about $36 billion off Musk's net worth since he took over Twitter in late October.
Musk's own moves appear to be mainly responsible. His sudden layoff of about half of Twitter's staff has affected investor sentiment toward Musk's car company, as have questionable tweets, such as one about the attack on Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's husband Paul.
Additional sales of Tesla stock by Musk—Tuesday evening, he disclosed roughly $4 billion worth of stock sales, presumably to help finance the Twitter purchase—added to the pressure on the price. Musk and Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment about the sales.
A large block of stock on sale, like Musk's $4 billion, can push down any stock. That could help explain the recent drop.
But the end of selling pressure as a large block is unloaded can lead to a share-price bounce. That wasn't the case on Wednesday, though.
Investors hate the kind of fuss and clamor Musk has been generating. ""For Musk who multiple times over the past year has said he is 'done selling Tesla stock' yet again loses more credibility with investors and his loyalists in a boy who cried wolf moment,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a Wednesday report. ""When does it end? The focus is Tesla or Twitter?""
That is hard to say. It's ultimately up to Musk himself.
Technical strategists, who look at chart patterns to predict short-term stock moves, continue to warn that the outlook for shares of the car company looks weak. With the stock closing below $180, then $150 could be in play.
Investors need to prepare for more pain. Things could get worse before they get better.
Ives, for his part, rates Tesla shares at Buy. His target for the stock price is $300.

435,9-Nov-22,Chicago Tribune,Is Elon Musk still trying to figure this Twitter thing out?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2733964630/BFD812D457A14912PQ/673?accountid=13946,"After closing his $44 billion deal to purchase Twitter, Elon Musk still seemed to be trying to figure out what he had bought. On Friday, the world's richest man cut about 3,700 of the company's 7,500 employees, saying in a tweet that ""unfortunately there is no choice when the company is losing over $4 million a day.But within hours, according to reports, the company was reaching out to ask dozens of those newly unemployed employees if they would please, please return to their jobs.Those dozens included not only those who were fired ""by mistake,"" according to reports, but also some whose knowledge will be critical to the development of new features that Musk would like to implement.They include members of the trust and safety teams that manage content moderation, a function that seemed more sorely needed than ever in the deluge of racist slurs, Nazi memes and other garbage that followed the takeover by Musk, a famously self-described ""free speech absolutist.""But those who were expecting even bigger changes, such as the restoration of former President Donald Trump's account, have to wait longer, says Musk. He tweeted on Friday that he would make ""no major content decisions or account reinstatements"" until the convening of a new ""moderation council.""Earlier in the week, Musk met by phone with civil rights groups in an effort to assure them that he would curtail hate speech, stop the spread of misinformation ahead of the midterm elections -- and restore access by Twitter employees to moderation tools from which they had been locked out during the company's acquisition.He confirmed in his Friday tweet that the council would have ""widely diverse viewpoints,"" but he offered no other information about it, its members or how much authority it would have. The groups reminded Musk that any such organization should include those who are targeted with hate-filled online language.Moderation matters, if Musk is to avoid the ""free-for-all-hellscape"" he promises Twitter will not become. We'll see. Besides social justice groups, Musk also has to be concerned about advertisers, readers and everyone else connected to the outsize role social networks play in our national politics and social discourse.Musk certainly could have invested in another exotic enterprise like his Tesla electric car company or his SpaceX venture in commercial space travel that might bring fewer public relations headaches -- and maybe an actual profit.But Musk's big buy-in, as many analysts see it, is all about influence, more than profits. Musk, a tireless self-promoter, already has used Twitter to market and sell products and joust with regulators and critics and build his fame.The social network offers him a more direct opportunity to engage and shape the national conversation as a self-proclaimed free speech advocate who already has whipped up a sizable politically minded fan base.The South Africa-born Musk can't run for president without a change in our Constitution. But he doesn't have to be president if he can influence one -- or a few.""The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square,"" he said in a speech to advertisers, ""where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence.""That's a relief, especially that violence part. But can he pull it off?If nothing else, we know Musk to be a man of ideas, even when they may come off as shoot-from-the-lip diatribes without much depth of thought. Now he seems to be discovering, as I predicted, that working out the delicate balance between free speech, social responsibility and public accountability is not as simple as Twitter tweets.I, too, have long called myself a free-speech absolutist, but Musk is only beginning to discover in real time the trade-offs that come with regulating media while also protecting speech and press freedoms.Congress has been dragging its heels, for example, in updating Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which created internet commerce as we know it and grants more immunity to content providers than newspapers, broadcast news and other old-school media have.Yet the Supreme Court is expected to hear multiple cases here on the types of internet speech coming out of state legislatures. Other governments such as Canada, Britain and India also are not waiting to pass regulations that can have an effect on our speech regulations.With that in mind, I welcome Musk to join the debate with something more substantial than casual tweets.---------[email protected]Twitter @cptimeCAPTION: Photo: Elon Musk's $44 billion deal to purchase Twitter is more about influence than profits, writes Clarence Page .

436,10-Nov-22,El Diario La Prensa,Cuánto dinero tendría Elon Musk si vendiera todas sus acciones de Tesla,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2734887147/BFD812D457A14912PQ/217?accountid=13946,"El empresario australiano Elon Musk en las últimas semanas ha estado en el ojo del huracán por adquirir Twitter, red social por la que desembolsó $48,000,000 mil millones de dólares.
Se ha pensado que luego de hacer dicha transacción, el fundador de Tesla podría quedar descapitalizado en su fortuna personal, no es así, en especial porque su dinero está sustentado por acciones de su propia compañía.
Aunque Musk ha vendido acciones de Tesla sigue teniendo un poderío económico inigualable, ya que, de acuerdo con un informe de investors, el nuevo CEO de Twitter tiene una solvencia económica tan grande que el premio mayor de Powerball de $2,000 millones de dólares parece pequeño.
Hasta antes de la venta de sus acciones de Tesla, en los primeros días de noviembre, Musk sigue tenía 465.1 millones de acciones de la compañía, lo que equivale a casi $89,000 millones de dólares, según el análisis de Investors Business Daily que se basó en datos de S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Por lo anterior, el dinero disponible para Musk es el equivalente a ganar 44 veces el premio mayor de Powerball. El martes de esta semana el nuevo líder de Twitter vendió 19.5 millones de acciones de Tesla valoradas en $3,700 millones de dólares.
De acuerdo con Investors, el valor de la posición de Musk en Tesla tiene una tendencia a la baja a medida que vende. Este año, el valor de la posición actual del empresario en acciones de Tesla ha bajado $74,900 millones de dólares.
Comparando de nuevo con el premio mayor de Powerball, eso significa que equivale a perder 37 boletos ganadores. Según los analistas, Elon Musk ha perdido más dinero del que valen casi 400 acciones en el S&P 500 individualmente este año.
Se pensaría que con la adquisición de Twitter el empresario tecnológico perdería gran parte de su fortuna, la realidad es que no es así, ya que ha perdido más dinero en acciones de Tesla este año.
A pesar de lo que ha ocurrido, el análisis de Investors indica que las pérdidas que vive su red social en comparación no son nada con lo que representa su fortuna personal, la cual se ve difícil que la agote en los próximos años o al mediano plazo.

437,10-Nov-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk Tries to Convince Wary Advertisers to Stay on Twitter; The social-media site's new owner laid out potential features such as payment options and long-form video,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2734404055/BFD812D457A14912PQ/442?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk tried to convince advertisers to continue buying ads on Twitter Inc. during a nearly hourlong question-and-answer event hosted on the company's live-audio Spaces platform, providing perhaps his most extensive public commentary to date on the future of Twitter as an ad-powered business.
Marketers including General Mills Inc., Pfizer Inc., Mondelez International Inc. and General Motors Co. have said they are pausing their advertising with Twitter since Mr. Musk's takeover late last month, largely either out of concern that Mr. Musk might weaken content moderation, potentially leading to more hate speech on the social-media platform, or because of the uncertainty surrounding the company's direction. That prompted Mr. Musk to say there has been a ""massive drop in revenue"" in a tweet last Friday.
Market-research firm Insider Intelligence on Wednesday cut its annual revenue outlook for Twitter by 40%.
Mr. Musk said in the question-and-answer event that he understands why some brands have paused their advertising until they have a clearer understanding of Twitter's evolution. But he said the platform has been more active in clamping down on bad behavior since he took over, and suggested that marketers with questions should simply tweet at him.
""I understand if people want to, you know, give it a minute and see how things are evolving,"" Mr. Musk said. ""But really, the best way to see how things are evolving is just to use Twitter. If there's something that you don't like, reply to one of my tweets and I'll do my best to respond.""
Mr. Musk also said advertisers shouldn't be concerned about Twitter's brand becoming indistinguishable from his own .
""Obviously Twitter cannot be simply some extension of me, because then anyone who doesn't agree with me will be put off,"" Mr. Musk said.
The event followed several private meetings with top executives at ad agency holding companies and their clients in a bid to shore up Twitter's advertising business. In those meetings, Mr. Musk's tone differed sharply from recent tweets in which he threatened a ""thermonuclear name & shame"" of brands that pull their ads from the platform, according to two agency executives who attended the events this week and last week.
In the event on Wednesday, Mr. Musk was joined by Robin Wheeler, Twitter's vice president of U.S. client solutions, who led the call, and Yoel Roth, senior director of safety and integrity.
Despite a surge in hateful activity on Twitter immediately following news of Mr. Musk's takeover, overall hate speech on Twitter has declined by about 95% compared with before the acquisition, according to Mr. Roth. It wasn't possible to independently verify the figure.
Brands and marketers, like most users, will have to pay to have their accounts verified, Mr. Musk said in response to a question from David Cohen, chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an industry trade organization. The only viable solution to Twitter's revenue challenges is a ""paywall for prominence"" that will lead to feeds that consist overwhelmingly of paid subscribers, or verified accounts, Mr. Musk said.
Earlier Wednesday, Twitter rolled out a gray check mark for verified accounts, but hours later Mr. Musk tweeted that he had killed it, saying the $7.99 blue check mark would be ""the greater level.""
In the advertisers' event, Mr. Musk said the success that he and his other companies, including electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc. and rocket firm SpaceX, have found by posting on Twitter should encourage brands and their executives to use the platform more freely, in addition to buying ads.
""Brands should tweet more, executives should tweet more. I would encourage people just to be more adventurous,"" he said. ""That's certainly what I've done on Twitter with Tesla and myself and SpaceX, and it's worked out quite well.""
In response to a prompt from Ms. Wheeler, Mr. Musk also told attendees, which included several top auto brands such as Ford Motor Co., Nissan Motor Co., Porsche AG and GM's Chevrolet, that he wouldn't use his ownership of Twitter to benefit Tesla at the expense of its automotive rivals.
GM was the first company to announce that it would be pulling its ads from Twitter last month, saying it wanted to better understand Mr. Musk's plans for the platform.
Mr. Musk said Twitter hasn't always satisfied advertisers' needs, such as ensuring that ads are relevant to targeted users and providing reliable ways to measure their performance. Twitter is attempting to better address these issues by considering changes like integrating paid ads into so-called recommended tweets, which are based on a given user's activity on the platform, said Mr. Musk.
More From CMO Today
Other potential new features include letting verified subscribers post high-quality videos that are up to several hours long, according to Mr. Musk. Twitter also plans to begin allowing both brands and creators to earn revenue on their accounts by enabling product sales directly in the app, he said.
Twitter's pivot toward subscriptions and e-commerce could also help minimize trolls and fake accounts, according to Mr. Musk. If most users' feeds consist primarily of tweets by paid profiles, and each verified account must use a legitimate credit card or bank account, then it will be more difficult for hostile governments or other parties to conduct large-scale harassment or influence campaigns, he said.
The ultimate responsibility for Twitter's success as an ad platform, as well as sensitive decisions like whether to ban individual users, falls to Mr. Musk as its owner, he said.
""I am the chief twit here, so the responsibility is mine. If things go wrong, it's my fault, because the buck stops with me,"" he said.

 Elon Musk Tries to Convince Wary Advertisers to Stay on Twitter

438,11-Nov-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla Makes Out Better Than Musk If Twitter Files Bankruptcy,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2735378272/BFD812D457A14912PQ/84?accountid=13946,"What a potential Twitter bankruptcy would mean for Elon Musk isn't easy to figure out, and it's harder to sort out how Tesla shareholders would be affected. When running through the likely consequences, however, a potential Twitter bankruptcy doesn't seem all that bad for the only publicly traded entity in Musk's business universe .
At the most basic level for Musk, a Twitter bankruptcy would mean he loses some $25 billion—roughly the amount of equity capital he put into the purchase. That amounts to about 10% of his pre-Twitter purchase wealth.
The average net worth of a U.S. household is about $1.2 million, according to Federal Reserve data. Musk's potential loss is like a U.S. household losing $120,000. (That's like totaling a Model S Plaid Edition with no insurance.)
There would also likely be reputational damage associated with having a large corporate failure on Musk's resume. He probably doesn't care. Musk has been dealing with naysayers questioning both Tesla (ticker: TSLA) and SpaceX for more than a decade.
The impact on Tesla isn't clear. The obvious potential negative is that a Twitter restructuring under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection reflects badly on Tesla's brand, driving car buyers away.
""Tesla is Musk,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a Thursday report. He took Tesla stock off his list of best ideas . He maintained his Buy rating on shares, though, with a $250 price target.
Another potential impact on Tesla is positive, though. A Twitter bankruptcy would mean Musk doesn't have to sell more Tesla stock to fund losses at his social-media platform.
Musk sold about $4 billion in Tesla stock recently. The New York Times reported Thursday that Musk told Twitter employees that it was to help save Twitter , which was losing billions. ""[B]ankruptcy is not out of the question,"" the report quoted Musk.
Musk didn't return a request for comment about the report. An executive poring billions into a company to save it is unusual. Yet Musk has done it before, back in 2008, while trying to keep Tesla afloat. That was very early in Tesla's existence, and success was far from guaranteed. Tesla's first series production vehicle, the Model S, was still years away at that point.
The specter of Musk's stock sales has been an overhang in Tesla stock since he offered to buy the social medial platform. Investors don't like large blocks of stock going on sale. They also don't like it when CEOs sell shares in companies they run.
Still, selling some stock, however, isn't a big fundamental issue for Tesla investors to wrestle with.
""Elon selling some stock is not great for shareholders over the short term, but….over the long term that's not really going to be something to keep an eye on for Tesla,"" says Global X ETF director of research Pedro Palandrani , adding he's ""not too worried about the Twitter overhang.""
Tesla is a top 10 holding in the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV).
Palandrani isn't really worried about brand taint, either. ""I don't think Tesla would suffer if [a Twitter bankruptcy] that were to happen,"" he adds. Palandrani sees Tesla executing its business plan well even as Musk spends time at Twitter.
If Twitter were to go bankrupt, at least Musk can recover some of his loss via tax deductions.
""Shareholders are usually treated poorly in a chapter 11 case. They rarely recover much, in any, of their investment,"" says accounting expert Robert Willens . ""For them, the only solace is losses for tax purposes. Once their stock is found to be worthless, they are entitled to capital-loss deductions in an amount equal to their basis in the stock.""
That only helps Musk. Tesla investors have a post-Twitter recovery hope, too. Tesla stock is down almost 16% since Musk took over Twitter, while the Nasdaq Composite has gained about 4%. Some of that 20 points of underperformance should be wiped out once, or if, things settle down at Twitter.
For Tesla, the 16% drop amounts to $110 billion of lost market capitalization. For Musk, it's cost him another $25 billion or so of his wealth.

To the Editor: I agree that Musk is deeply sabotaging the Tesla brand. His sometimes-stupid tweets are pushing away the left-wingers who believe in climate change. They should be his core market. Most of the right-wingers he is struggling to ""give a voice to"" don't want to buy an electric car. For the dismayed left-wingers, there are now alternatives: At the high end, Mercedes-Benz Group looks very appealing, with Ford Motor and BYD Auto competing in the less-expensive realm.

Fed Failures
To the Editor: ""The Fed is no longer the markets' friend, and it won't be for some time,"" writes Nicholas Jasinski ("" How to Adapt Your Portfolio ,"" The Trader, Oct. 4). What an understatement! Remember the Fed's description of inflation as being ""transitory""? Was it serious? Chairman Jerome Powell, and all of the Fed governors that either supported his position or remained silent, should have resigned and been replaced many months ago. The Fed failed to diagnose our economic problems, then did too little, too late, to improve them. Imagine, the greatest economic minds continue to scramble in this severely inflationary environment. Jasinski is correct—longer pain before some gain.

FDIC-Insured Savings
To the Editor: I enjoy reading your articles about income investing, but I am puzzled that during these unsettling investing times you recommend bond funds yielding 3.3% when you can now earn up to 3.6% in an FDIC-insured savings account with no worries about fluctuations in the valuation of a fund ("" These 3 Funds Are Beating the Bear Market in Bonds ,"" Income Investing, Nov. 4). In addition, the savings banks seem to be in competition and continue to raise their interest rates to keep up with the Federal Reserve rate increases. It seems to me that at least a portion of our investment dollars should be in these savings accounts at this time.

Converting to a Roth
To the Editor: Lewis Braham's article discussing the pros and cons of a traditional IRA versus a Roth IRA ignores a possible negative consequence when converting to a Roth: that Congress may reverse course and make withdrawals from a Roth taxable ("" This Is The Best Tax Move You Can Make Right Now ,"" Nov. 2).
There are precedents for such a retroactive move, most recently when the Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated the accelerated depreciation legally offered to real estate partnerships that underwrote Section 8 assisted housing developments. Those who invested in these partnerships were hurt dramatically by this retroactive move by Congress. Don't think it could never happen again.
Bill Gottdenker, Mountainside, N.J.
Tax-Loss Strategy
To the Editor: I strongly disagree with Steven M. Sears' tax-loss strategy ("" Selling Losing Stocks Can Lower Your Taxes. Using Options Is a Less Risky Way to Buy Them Back ,"" The Striking Price, Nov. 3). If you want to take a tax loss, you never need to ""double up."" You just sell your holdings and hope they don't go up during the 30 days. If you expect American Express to go up, purchase Mastercard and Visa and sell them when you repurchase AmEx.
There is very little commission expense today. Doubling can possibly double your loss for the month. Sears says that you lose less money buying an option than the stock. That is true only if the stock quickly goes near zero; otherwise, the normal 10% to 20% drop in the stock market costs much more if you have the options, rather than the stock. This is because of the time value of options, which you pay for.

Affordable Housing
To the Editor: J.W. Mason's article, ""The Fed Is Trying to Force Down Housing Prices. There's a Better Way"" (Other Voices, Nov. 4), offers wisdom on our volatile and expensive housing market. The need for affordable housing where land prices are reasonable could be further mitigated with modern manufactured homes. Repurposing underutilized urban office buildings into residential units is another approach. Those innovative commercial property owners will be rewarded with increased demand and earnings.

440,11-Nov-22,Los Angeles Times,Twitter's potential dark side; How far will a mercurial Elon Musk move the social media platform's moderation boundaries?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2734891180/BFD812D457A14912PQ/634?accountid=13946,"For Twitter's 200 million-plus daily active users, it's been a long, strange two weeks. Elon Musk, billionaire, CEO and Twitter superfan, spent $44 billion on a much-contested, overvalued and at times dubious acquisition of his very favorite corner of the internet. Besides firing Twitter's top leadership and half the rest of the staff last week, exactly what he plans to do with his new toy is murky at best.
Except for one thing: Among Musk's many antics and public pronouncements since acquisition talks began in April, he has consistently cited the obliteration of content moderation on Twitter as a primary motive for the purchase.
For those in the social media industry and those, like me, who study it, what Musk views as content moderation appears remarkable for its narrowness. It focuses mostly on takedowns of controversial claims, language or account holders, ignoring the moderation work that removes destructive spam and bots. To social media experts, Musk's disdain for Twitter's rules comes off as naive, and his desire for near-absolute ""free speech"" on the website as a misguided impossibility.

Despite what critics like Musk seem to think, content moderation is far from a partisan tool of the woke mob.
Done well, content moderation requires an expansive, interrelated and cross-company system of people, policy and practices. It must adhere to legal mandates that differ country by country and that can carry costly fines. It must encourage the widest possible user participation and at the same time reduce the potential for user harm from that participation. And it must constantly refine computational tools, automation and the human judgment required to meet those ends.
The night before Musk formally took charge at Twitter, he crowed to his 115 million followers, ""the bird is freed."" It was as good as announcing that he didn't know what he didn't know.
Twitter's moderation standards already erred toward permissiveness, especially when weighed against its closest market peers. For example, unlike many other platforms, Twitter allows users to circulate consensual sexual content featuring adults, giving an outlet to people who enjoy such material while also taking seriously anything that crosses a legal line or violates policies against such things as gratuitous violence, threats, self-harm and the abuse or torture of animals.
Twitter's former top lawyer and policy chief, Vijaya Gadde, had an outsize role in establishing and policing its expansive but still safe rules. She is as well-known for fighting in court for a user's right to post as she is for banning @realDonaldTrump after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Musk fired Gadde in his first round of axings.
Yoel Roth, the head of content moderation who has now reportedly resigned, posted a thread last week to reassure doubters that the site's ""core"" practices were in place. His in-house ""Trust & Safety"" team, he tweeted, had been reduced by just 15%, and the front-line workers -- the globally dispersed outside contractors who do the bulk of Twitter's moderation work -- by less than that.
Most of us wouldn't be able to stomach what these human moderators see over and over, every day. It is a sad but universal truth that there are enough people interested in uploading and circulating this kind of stuff that a social media company needs to employ a small army of low-wage, low-status workers to deal with it. Twitter's small army just got smaller.
Even before the corporate bloodletting, Musk's Twitter began to show its dark side. Montclair State University researchers clocked an ""immediate, visible and measurable spike"" in hate speech on the site during the first 12 hours of Musk's ownership.
Musk addressed an open letter to advertisers trying to allay their jitters over the possible reputational degradation of the site. Twitter, he said, would not descend into an unmoderated ""free-for-all hellscape."" Nonetheless, major advertisers -- General Mills, Volkswagen and General Motors among others -- ""paused"" their participation.
Musk responded by threatening to ""name and shame"" specific brands that had pulled ads, and he blamed ""activist"" groups for the loss of advertising dollars.
What's the worst that could happen? What are the advertisers, users and others worried about? A Twitter where anything goes, where a mercurial and arrogant decision maker with no experience in running a social media site polls his fans for product ideas and moves policy and moderation boundaries at will.
Musk keeps pointing out that Twitter's moderation hasn't changed. Yet. He swears he'll appoint a diverse moderation council to replace old Twitter's system. But with Twitter bleeding $4 million a day, according to Musk's tweets, will anyone left be willing to go to the mat the next time @kanyewest, for example, uses his account to project ""death con 3"" on Jews?
An apt analogy to the new, Elonian Twitter could perhaps be a car with iffy brakes, speeding down a road with no guardrails. But that might be lost on Musk; he has thus far been relatively unperturbed about spontaneously combusting Teslas and troubled autopilot programming that in one set of tests reportedly failed to recognize the shape of a moving child in its path.
Just before Musk's takeover of Twitter was finalized, he had changed his profile, anointing himself ""Chief Twit."" After two weeks of staff bloodletting, revenue missteps, abrupt policy shifts and general Twitter chaos, we now can all say: Hail to the chief.

Berkshire Hathaway now owns some $58 billion of Chevron and Occidental Petroleum securities. It isn't Berkshire's largest holding; that would be insurance, led by auto insurer Geico; 6% of Apple, worth $135 billion; and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, at $130 billion based on the market value of its similarly sized public rival Union Pacific.
But energy is this year's focus. About half of Berkshire's $66 billion of stock purchases in 2022 have been in energy. Berkshire owns over 8% of Chevron, the No. 2 U.S. energy company—80% acquired this year—that is now worth some $32 billion with a gain of about $8 billion, based on a Barron's estimate. Berkshire's 20% Occidental Petroleum stake, all bought this year, is worth $15 billion with an estimated profit of some $5 billion. Berkshire also has $10 billion of OXY preferred stock with an 8% dividend yield.
Other Berkshire equity purchases haven't fared as well this year, including Paramount Global, HP Inc., and Citigroup. All three are in the red.
Buffett was asked at Berkshire's 2021 shareholder meeting whether he was comfortable owning oil stocks. ""If you expect perfection in your spouse or your friends or in a company, you're not going to find it,"" he said. ""Chevron is not an evil company in the least."" Buffett then asked Vice Chairman Charlie Munger for his view. ""You can imagine two things,"" Munger said. ""A young man marries into your family. He's an English professor at, say, Swarthmore, or he works for Chevron. Which would you pick? I'd take the guy from Chevron.""

Last Week
Past the Peak?
Meta Platforms began layoffs of 13% of its 87,000-person workforce. Berkshire Hathaway took a quarterly loss, mostly on its investment portfolio and insurance payouts, while buying back shares. Heavy spending on streaming depressed Walt Disney's profits. And Elon Musk sold $4 billion in Tesla shares. Stocks rose to start the week, then slipped on election uncertainty. October inflation slowed to 7.7%, fueling the biggest rally since 2020. On the week, the Dow industrials rose 4.15%, to 33,749.18; the S&P 500 was up 5.9%, to 3993.05; and the Nasdaq Composite soared 8.1%, to 11323.33.
A Crypto Coronary
It started with a Twitter spat between crypto-exchange leaders Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX and Changpeng Zhao of Binance, over Binance selling off $588 million in FTX tokens. By Tuesday, FTX found itself in a liquidity squeeze and turned to Binance for a bailout. Binance began due diligence, only to pull out on Wednesday. FTX halted withdrawals, Bankman-Fried hunted for $8 billion, regulators moved in, and crypto tokens fell. On Friday, FTX declared bankruptcy and Bankman-Fried quit.
No Wave
Democrats turned back a much-predicted GOP wave. Republicans neared control of the House, two key Senate races remain undecided, and a third, Georgia, is going to a December runoff. Former President Donald Trump, hinting at running again, saw many of his candidates lose. Trump attacked Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a rival, who had won re-election easily.
Russia Exits Kherson
Moscow ordered a retreat from Kherson, and Ukrainian forces quickly moved into the key city. Ukraine President Zelensky said talks with Russia are possible—on Ukrainian terms.
More Covid in China
Covid cases hit a six-month high in China, and the country's National Health Commission promised to be ""unrelenting"" on curbs. Exports fell in October. Apple warned of iPhone 14 supply delays in China, and Bloomberg reported that the company expects to make three million fewer iPhone 14s in 2022. Distressed investor Oaktree sold a 2.2 million-square-foot plot in Hong Kong for $637 million that had been slated for a Versailles-styled mansion for China Evergrande's chairman. Evergrande took a loss of $770 million on the project.

442,13-Nov-22,Hartford Courant,Big Tech billionaires lost fortunes this year. The hit to your 401(k) might feel even worse.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2735602524/BFD812D457A14912PQ/647?accountid=13946,"Billionaires raked it in during the early stages of the pandemic, but 2022 has not been nearly as kind. In fact, since the beginning of the year, some of the world's richest tech billionaires-a list that includes Mark Zuckerberg of Meta Platforms, Elon Musk of Tesla and Jeff Bezos of Amazon-have seen their fortunes bleed out by tens of billions of dollars.
Here is the year-to-date damage to a handful of tech billionaires' net worths, according to data from the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (as of Oct. 30):
Mark Zuckerberg: -$87.3 billion (year-to-date)
Elon Musk: -$66.4 billion
Jeff Bezos: -$65.7 billion
Larry Page: -$39.2 billion
Sergey Brin: -$38.1 billion
Bill Gates: -$27.3 billion
Steve Ballmer: -$21.3 billion
Larry Ellison: -$14 billion
Interestingly, billionaires in other sectors have seen their net worth increase this year, despite the shaky economy. Members of the Koch and Mars families, for example, have seen their fortunes swell by more than $4 billion.
But the staggering losses by tech's richest people - which may not be realized losses, as in some (or most) cases, that wealth is tied to investment holdings - is eye-popping considering how high valuations were a year or two ago. 
Take Zuckerberg, for example: The most recent earnings report from Facebook's parent company showed a decline in profits and revenue, and it sent share prices plummeting. Zuckerberg, who at one time had a net worth of more than $136 billion, has seen his fortune erode by almost $100 billion, and is currently worth $38.2 billion.
In other words, his net worth has declined by more than 75% since its peak last year. 
Similarly, Bezos has seen his net worth decline by around 50% after a disappointing Amazon earnings report. And Musk, whose net worth topped out at $340 billion last year, has lost 40% of his wealth.
While the thought of seeing $1 billion evaporate, let alone $100 billion, is mind-boggling to the average American, the typical investor hasn't been spared, either. 
Data from the Federal Reserve, published in September, shows that U.S. households collectively saw their wealth drop by $6.1 trillion, which was largely due to $7.7 trillion in stock market losses. 
And the most recent Building Financial Futures report from Fidelity, published in August, shows that the average 401(k) balance for all Americans was $103,800 - down around 20% year-over-year and 15% year-to-date. 
Additional data from Northwestern Mutual shows that Americans saw their retirement savings lose between 12% and 20% over the past year. Keep in mind, too, that since the middle of August, the S&P 500 has fallen about another 10%, so losses are mounting as the year goes on.
As such, while the Zuckerbergs and Musks of the world are certainly bearing the brunt of the economic downturn in terms of the impact on their net worths, the average American is feeling the crunch, too, albeit on a much smaller scale.
There isn't one single thing to blame for the current shaky economy, either - inflation is the big factor (and corresponding interest rate hikes), but so is the fact that many people are simply not willing to curb their spending after two years of the pandemic, which is further stoking inflation.
""It's a period of uncertainty for many people, driven largely by rising inflation and volatility in the markets,"" said Christian Mitchell, a Northwestern Mutual executive. ""We've also seen upticks in spending year-over-year not only as a result of inflation, but also as people have resumed a sense of normalcy in their lives following the earlier days of the pandemic.""

443,14-Nov-22,The New York Observer,Elon Musk Heads to Court To Defend His $56 Billion Tesla Bonus Package,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2736064931/BFD812D457A14912PQ/39?accountid=13946,"A Tesla shareholder is seeking to nullify Elon Musk’s $56 billion Tesla pay package. Apu Gomes/Getty Images
Elon Musk is headed to court this week to defend his $56 billion Tesla compensation package, in response to a lawsuit brought up by a Tesla shareholder in 2018. A five-day trial over the case kicked off today (Nov. 14) in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The Tesla CEO is scheduled to take the stand Nov. 16.
The trial came at a busy time for Musk, who claims he is working 120 hours a week to run the newly acquired Twitter and his other companies.
The lawsuit was filed in June 2018 by Richard Tornetta, a Tesla shareholder, three months after Tesla’s board approved a compensation package for Musk that would reward him 12 tranches of stock options on the condition that he accomplishes certain performance milestones, including increasing Tesla’s market cap by ten times, to $650 billion. The board at the time valued the package at $2.6 billion. But if Tesla reached the targeted market cap, the package would actually be worth a $56 billion.
Tesla’s share price has skyrocketed since 2018. Its market cap surpassed $650 billion in December 2020 before dropping below that threshold this year. The electric carmaker is currently worth $608 billion.
Tornetta, the plaintiff, alleges Tesla’s board failed to disclose crucial information about the compensation plan to shareholders, who signed off on it, and seeks to nullify the package. But Musk has received 11 tranches of the stock options promised under the plan.
Several current and former Tesla board members and executives are expected to testify in court this week. Ira Ehrenpreis, a board director who heads Tesla’s compensation committee, is scheduled to testify today, followed by Todd Maron, Tesla’s former general counsel, and Deepak Ahuja, former chief financial officer.
Robyn Denholm, chairwoman of Tesla, is scheduled to testify remotely tomorrow. Board member James Murdoch is expected to take the stand after Musk.
The nonjury trial will be heard by Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who also presided over Twitter’s now-dropped lawsuit seeking to compel Musk to close his $44 billion acquisition of the social media company. The trial won’t feature opening or closing statements, and a verdict could follow several months after the trial concludes. If Tesla loses, Musk may have to return his bonuses, including stock options he has already received."

A Tesla shareholder is asking Delaware's business-law court to rescind Mr. Musk's CEO pay package, which was approved in 2018 and is valued at around $52 billion at recent share prices. The plaintiff has alleged that Tesla's board at the time failed to disclose key information about the deal and how it came together.
Attorneys representing current and former Tesla board members have said the package has been successful and was approved through a fair process. They point to the performance of the company, now the world's most valuable car company with a market capitalization of nearly $620 billion. The company was valued at less than $60 billion when shareholders approved Mr. Musk's latest pay deal.
The case is slated for a five-day, nonjury trial starting Monday in Wilmington, Del. It is set to be heard by Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who presided over Twitter Inc.'s lawsuit seeking to compel Mr. Musk to close his $44 billion deal for the social-media company. The transaction closed late last month, before the case went to trial.
The trial this week comes at a busy time for Mr. Musk, who has been putting his imprint on Twitter. He also runs rocket company SpaceX.
The Tesla chief executive is expected to take the stand Wednesday in a trial that doesn't feature opening or closing statements and where judgment typically is rendered by the judge months after the trial concludes. Also slated to testify are several current and former Tesla board members.
A central question in the case is whether Mr. Musk controlled the board's consideration of his pay package. Mr. Musk owned around 22% of Tesla at the time and had close ties to several directors. The plaintiff alleges Mr. Musk controlled the board, that the board misled shareholders in securing their approval for the stock grant, and that the deal was unnecessary to motivate him.
The world's richest man, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Mr. Musk doesn't accept a salary from the car maker. Instead, he is compensated in stock options that vest based on Tesla's valuation and achievement of operational milestones. The car maker achieved the targets required for all but one of Mr. Musk's 12 tranches of options to vest.
""The Board characterized each of the Grant's milestones as 'challenging' and 'difficult to achieve,' but omitted that three performance milestones were probable of achievement within one-and-a-half years of the Grant date,"" lawyers for the plaintiff said in a court filing.
Attorneys representing the current and former board members said Mr. Musk didn't control Tesla's consideration of his pay package, and shareholders were fully informed when they signed off on it.
The plaintiff has a tough path, attorneys unaffiliated with the case said, pointing to the at-risk nature of Mr. Musk's compensation and Tesla's performance since the board and shareholders signed off on it.
Greg Varallo, an attorney for the plaintiff, said his side looked forward to presenting its case.

445,14-Nov-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Is Due in Court—Again. A Primer on What to Watch This Time.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2735987619/BFD812D457A14912PQ/301?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk is expected to take the stand in Delaware Chancery Court this week in a trial over a stock options award in 2018 that accounts for about $50 billion of his wealth.
The award gave Musk the ability to buy roughly 300 million shares of Tesla stock (ticker: TSLA) for roughly $23 a piece if Tesla hit various milestones related to factors such as sales and market capitalization. Musk hasn't earned all the options yet.
The lawsuit was brought by Tesla shareholder Richard J. Tornetta, who wants the 2018 options grant rescinded. The lawsuit alleges that in 2019, when the 2018 stock award was being worked on, the compensation committee wasn't independent and was influenced by Musk.
When the options grant was voted on by shareholders, more than 60 million shares were voted in favor of the grant and about 30 million were voted against it.
With the pay approved, what is the big deal? Well, if the directors weren't acting independently, then the proxy was misleading. Shareholders didn't have all the information they needed.
The suit also has a problem with how the pay package passed. Shareholders representing roughly 110 million shares abstained and about 50 million shares weren't voted. So essentially only about 60 million of 250 million of total shares outstanding approved the proxy item voted on in 2019. That isn't the fault of Musk or the board. Still, a majority of a minority of shareholders approving the pay isn't fair, the lawsuit argues.
If the judge decides the case in favor of Tornetta, Musk, of course, would have nearly all of his compensation designed to be earned between 2019 and 2029 wiped out. That is his headache.
But he will get paid something. That is the board's headache. It would have to create a new package—or have shareholders vote on the same package with expanded disclosures about director independence.
It feels very high stakes. The ultimate impact on Tesla stock, however, is likely right around zero. Musk is unlikely to quit because he is unhappy with his pay. He owns more than 440 million Tesla shares—excluding the 2018 options—so he probably wouldn't just up and leave.
Tesla stock closed down 2.6% in Monday trading. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.9% and 1.1%.
Tesla stock is underperforming, but the Delaware trial probably isn't the reason. Twitter might be.
Investors continue to watch Musk's very public management of the social media company and wonder if it will impact Tesla's brand, or if Musk needs to sell more of his actual Tesla stock holdings to help put Twitter on stronger financial footing.
Tesla stock is down roughly 15% since Musk took over Twitter. The Nasdaq Composite is up about 5% over the same span. That 20 point underperformance is the real headache Tesla investors are dealing with.

446,15-Nov-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Tesla Projections Take Center Stage on Day Two of Elon Musk Compensation Trial; Company's chair testifies in trial over Musk's multibillion-dollar pay package,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2736316410/BFD812D457A14912PQ/180?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc. financial projections were front-and-center Tuesday in the trial over Elon Musk's multibillion-dollar pay package at the electric-vehicle maker .
A Tesla shareholder, Richard Tornetta, is seeking to nullify Mr. Musk's 2018 compensation grant, alleging that Mr. Musk controlled the board's consideration of his pay package and failed to disclose crucial information to shareholders who signed off on it—such as that the company had already determined it was likely to achieve certain targets underpinning the grant. The package is worth around $52 billion at recent share prices.
Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm, who testified remotely, called the goals tied to Mr. Musk's grant ""audacious"" and characterized Tesla's operational forecasting as ""not reliable."" She served on the board as the compensation package was being considered but wasn't yet its chair.
Tesla, for example, might produce 100 semitrailer trucks this year, Ms. Denholm said, years behind schedule. Tesla revealed the truck in 2017 and Ms. Denholm said internal projections from early 2018 contemplated producing thousands of the trucks, which the company initially aimed to release in 2019. More recently, Mr. Musk said the company plans to deliver its first semitrailer trucks to PepsiCo Inc. next month.
Former Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja echoed Ms. Denholm, saying Tesla's internal targets at the time ""were absolutely not easy for us to achieve."" Like earlier witnesses, he said Mr. Musk didn't dictate the terms of the grant, which vests based on Tesla's valuation and achievement of various milestones.
Mr. Musk, who doesn't accept a salary from Tesla, has secured all but one of the 12 tranches of options available under the grant based on Tesla's having achieved various targets.
An attorney for the plaintiff displayed Tesla records showing that internal projections leading up to shareholder approval of the pay package contemplated that the company would soon achieve some of the targets.
""The Board characterized each of the Grant's milestones as 'challenging' and 'difficult to achieve,' but omitted that three performance milestones were probable of achievement within one-and-a-half years of the Grant date,"" lawyers for the plaintiff said in a court filing.
Tesla's market capitalization has increased roughly 10-fold since shareholders signed off on the CEO's pay package in March 2018, helping Tesla become the world's most valuable car maker and Mr. Musk its wealthiest person.
The plaintiff also alleges the deal was unnecessary to motivate Mr. Musk. A plaintiff's attorney on Monday pointed to a May 2017 Tesla earnings call in which Mr. Musk said he planned to be actively involved in the company for the rest of his life.
Mr. Musk is expected to take the stand when the trial resumes Wednesday. Also due to testify this week are board member James Murdoch and former board members Antonio Gracias and Brad Buss.
Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, the judge in the five-day, nonjury trial, isn't expected to issue a verdict for months after the trial concludes. The judge also presided over Twitter Inc.'s lawsuit seeking to compel Mr. Musk to close his $44 billion deal for the social-media company. The transaction closed late last month, before the case went to trial.
 Monday's testimony centered on how much influence Mr. Musk, Tesla's chief executive, had in determining his own compensation.
Ira Ehrenpreis, who ran point for Tesla's board in devising the plan, testified that the pay package featured ""extraordinarily ambitious and difficult"" hurdles and was meant to keep Mr. Musk, a serial entrepreneur, engaged in the car maker. Mr. Musk owned around 22% of Tesla at the time and had close ties to several directors.
A cross-examination of Mr. Ehrenpreis by a plaintiff's attorney on Monday zeroed in on the extent to which the compensation plan aligned with what Mr. Musk sought. Mr. Ehrenpreis said board members considered multiple options before settling on the plan shareholders eventually endorsed.
The trial comes at a busy time for Mr. Musk, who has been making his mark on Twitter , laying off around 50% of its staff and implementing various product changes. He also runs rocket company SpaceX.
""I have too much work on my plate , that is for sure,"" Mr. Musk said in a virtual appearance at a conference in Indonesia Monday.
Ms. Denholm said she is focused on the results Mr. Musk is able to drive at Tesla, not the amount of time he dedicates to the company.

""At a critical juncture for the Company, the Plan motivated Musk to focus his exceptional talents on Tesla when Musk's future with Tesla was uncertain, especially given his other interests and opportunities,"" they said in a court filing.
Employee stock options have been at the heart of several controversies at Tesla, where the question of who should benefit from the company's stratospheric rise has led to tension, The Wall Street Journal recently reported. An issue of broader concern for Mr. Musk has been that some employees were making more at Tesla than he thought their contributions merited.

448,16-Nov-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Has the Next Tesla CEO in Mind. There Are a Few Candidates.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2736900145/BFD812D457A14912PQ/63?accountid=13946,"Tesla board member James Murdoch says Elon Musk knows who could run Tesla after him. It might have been a throwaway line said while being questioned in a trial. Still, it's a chance for investors to consider who's next.
Murdoch is a Tesla (ticker: TSLA) board member and appeared in a Delaware court Wednesday in connection with a shareholder lawsuit about Musk's $50 billion-plus pay package awarded back in 2019.
The pay package will give Musk roughly 300 million shares, at a price of about $23 a piece, if certain milestones are hit. That is about 10% of the company. Tesla has roughly 3 billion shares outstanding.
Whether the suit succeeds or not isn't really all that big a deal for Tesla investors. A win for plaintiffs means that Musk exerts a lot of control at Tesla and on Tesla's board. Investors just won't be shocked or concerned by that outcome. And if Musk loses his options Tesla's board will have to do something else.
As long as Musk doesn't quit out of frustration, the Delaware trial isn't a Tesla stock-moving event.
Who runs Tesla, or any company, is always a stock-moving event.
Musk was asked about succession at the August meeting of shareholders. ""I intend to stay at Tesla as long as I can be useful,"" said the CEO, adding ""I think [Tesla has] got a very bright future even without me."" and, ""I'm not leaving, just to be clear.""
But a transition will happen some day. One question for investors to consider is if the next CEO will come from outside or inside the company.
One outsider that is available is former Volkswagen (VOW. Germany) CEO Herbert Diess. Musk seems comfortable with Diess, even appearing at a Volkswagen management event hosted by Diess in October 2021. Musk also praised Diess for ""moving VW rapidly toward electrification"" back in April.
Other outside candidates might have Tesla ties such as Tesla co-founder J.B. Straubel. He left Tesla back in 2019 and now runs EV materials company Redwood Materials .
Any list of insider candidates has to start with CFO Zachry Kirkhorn and engineering head Drew Baglino. Those are the two executives listed along side Musk in annual filings.
There are other long-serving Tesla executive, such as vehicle engineering VP Lars Moravy and sales VP Troy Jones, but investors don't know a lot about them because they don't speak at investor conferences and events.
Murdoch's comment could spur a list with any number of candidates. All of this is still only speculation. His answer in court might have been designed to show Tesla's board thinks about management succession. That is a job for any board of directors.
Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment about management succession.
Tesla stock was down about 3.9% Wednesday while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 0.8% and 1.5%, respectively.
Succession probably didn't cause any underperformance. Investors were probably following the broader market as well as news of more EV price cuts in China. China is a significant market for Tesla, it's the largest market for EVs on the planet and Tesla generates about one-quarter of company sales in the country.

Tesla Stock May Benefit.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2736884198/BFD812D457A14912PQ/107?accountid=13946,"Tesla investors have been reeling since Elon Musk took over Twitter, worried about all the time their CEO was spending at his social-media platform. There is also the potential brand damage Musk might do to his car company while making tough decisions designed to turn Twitter's performance around.
Tesla (ticker: TSLA) investors might stop thinking about a Twitter wildcard in the near future. Apparently, Musk is looking for help.
The overhang is real—and painful. Tesla stock is down roughly 17% since Musk took over Twitter. The Nasdaq Composite is up about 4% over the same span.
Investors have reacted with nervousness, while Musk dramatically laid off staff and tweeted some questionable things . He also insisted Twitter needed a technologist, like himself, and not a person with more media experience. That view might be softening. Musk testified in a Delaware courtroom Wednesday. The trial had nothing to do with Twitter. It was about Musk's $50 billion-plus pay package awarded back in 2019. The topic of Twitter came up, though. Musk said he was looking for someone to run Twitter, according to reports coming from the courtroom. Twitter and Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment about Musk's comments at the trial.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives tweeted ""This is very, very good and welcomed news"" on Wednesday. He covered Twitter before the buyout. He still covers Tesla stock, rating the shares a Buy. His price target is $250. He cut his target price to that level from $300 about a week ago, calling Twitter an ""albatross"" for Tesla stock. The Street likes the news. Help at Twitter should also be music to the ears of Tesla investors who don't fully agree with Musk's assessment of Twitter's needs. ""Since Elon is the tech guy, he needs someone who can talk to advertisers about platform efficacy,"" says Future Fund Active exchange-traded fund (FFND) co-founder, and Tesla shareholder, Gary Black . Musk has lamented the loss of advertising revenue since he took over, at one point blaming activist groups for pressuring advertisers.
He want to generate more sales from subscriptions—such as the $8 monthly fee for a blue ""verified"" check mark that confers some legitimacy to a Twitter account. But that's a log row to hoe. Black points out advertising made up 92% of sales in the second quarter.
If Musk is warming to the idea of a person with more media experience former T-Mobile US (TMUS) CEO John Legere could be a good choice. ""John is the perfect person to help,"" says Gerber Kawasaki Wealth Management CEO Ross Gerber .
Musk didn't seem to like that idea though tweeting "" Um…no "" on Monday in response to Legere's name.
Gerber also recommends Kevin Mayer. He built Disney+ and has credibility with advertisers. ""I'm trying to get him to replace himself as 'Chief Twit' and get a great media CEO,"" adds Gerber. ""Elon should be running the tech, not the business, he doesn't seem to understand media at all.""
Gerber is literally invested in how Twitter runs. He still owns a part of Twitter since he kept his stake in the social-media platform when Musk took it private. Musk has other investors with him too. It reduced the amount of his own money he needed to put in to complete the purchase. The exact number of people investing along side Musk in Twitter isn't known.
Gerber owns Tesla stock too. Most Tesla investors, however, don't really care what happens at Twitter. They just want the overhang to go away.
A new media-savvy CEO or manager for Twitter would eat into that 21 percentage point underperformance separating Tesla stock and the Nasdaq Composite.
Tesla stock dropped almost 4% on Wednesday, closing at under $187. Investors might have been paying attention more to EV price cuts in China or the broader market—the S&P 500 fell 0.8%—than a trial about an old issue. Investors shouldn't tune out Musk, though. He's proven himself capable of doing the unexpected, and quickly.

451,16-Nov-22,USA Today (Online),Elon Musk pay package at Tesla challenged in court,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2736499845/BFD812D457A14912PQ/153?accountid=13946,"WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) — Testimony began Monday in a Delaware courtroom where a Tesla shareholder is challenging a compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk potentially worth more than $55 billion. The lawsuit alleges that the performance-based stock option grant was negotiated by a compensation committee and approved in 2018 by Tesla board members who had conflicts of interest due to personal and professional ties to Musk. The lawsuit, filed in 2018, also alleges that the shareholder vote to approve that compensation was based on an incomplete and misleading proxy statement. Another option? With Elon Musk ruining Twitter, it's time to get back to hollering on street corners Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that proxy wrongly described members of the compensation committee as ""independent,"" and characterized all the milestones that triggered vesting in the stock options as ""stretch"" goals meant to be difficult to achieve, even though internal projections indicated that three operational milestones were likely to be achieved within 18 months of the stockholder vote. ""Any action by stockholders based on a materially misleading proxy is a nullity and the grant fails,"" according to a brief by the plaintiff's attorneys. Tesla owners worry:Tesla recalls more than 40,000 vehicles for possible loss of power steering Attorneys for the defendants countered in their pretrial brief that two institutional proxy advisers noted that the plan would require ""significant and perhaps historic achievements"" and require growth that ""appear stretching by any benchmark."" The first witness to testify was Ira Ehrenpreis, a prominent venture capitalist and longtime friend of Musk who chaired Tesla's compensation committee when the grant was formulated. Are you in danger? Remove these 5 dangerous tech gadgets from your home Under the plan, Musk stood to reap billions if the electric car and solar panel maker hit certain market capitalization and operational milestones. For each of incidence of simultaneously meeting a market cap milestone and an operational milestone, Musk, who already owned about 22% of Tesla when the plan was approved, would get stock equal to 1% of outstanding shares at the time of the grant. His interest in the company would grow to about 28% if the company's market capitalization grew by $600 billion. Each milestone in the plan includes expanding Tesla's market capitalization by $50 billion and meeting an aggressive revenue or pretax profit growth target. Musk stood to receive the full benefit of the pay plan, $55.8 billion, only if Tesla hit a market capitalization of $650 billion and unprecedented revenues and earnings within a decade. To date, Tesla has achieved all 12 of the market capitalization milestones and 11 of the operational milestones, resulting in the vesting of 11 of the grant's 12 installments and providing Musk over $52.4B in stock option gains, according to the lawsuit. Since the grant was awarded, Tesla's market capitalization has increased from $59 billion to more than $690 billion, having briefly hit $1 trillion early this year. Shares of Tesla Inc. have been battered this year, like all automakers, due to a mix of backed-up supply chains and soaring inflation. Tesla shares have fallen 46% this year, while shares of Ford and GM have fallen around 31%. However, the Austin, Texas, company earned $5.5 billion in 2021, blowing away the previous year's profit of $721 million. It also produced a record 936,000 vehicles, nearly double what the company rolled off the assembly line in 2020. Musk's money troubles: Elon Musk's net worth cut nearly in half as Tesla stock prices dive Ehrenpreis testified that much of Tesla's success has been the result of Musk's leadership, which he said combined bold vision with ""a maniacal focus on execution."" ""He has both a bold vision, but he has been as hard working a CEO as there can be,"" Ehrenpreis said. Under questioning from defense attorney Evan Chesler, Ehrenpreis described the nearly yearlong process under which he and other directors discussed and developed the compensation plan with the help of legal advisers and independent consultants, as well as input from major institutional investors. Ehrenpreis described the milestones in the plans as ""extraordinarily ambitious and difficult."" According to minutes from a 2017 meeting of the compensation committee, the directors wanted to properly balance the motivation of ""stretch"" goals for Musk while avoiding ""demotivating factors created by seemingly impractical, unrealistic or unachievable goals."" Fakes abound: Twitter blue parody accounts flood the platform after new subscription service rollout Ehrenpreis also testified that his friendship with Musk played no role in his vote to approve the plan. ""I felt that it was very important to ensure Elon's leadership in this next chapter of the company's life,"" he said, adding it was the kind of ambitious plan that drives Musk and would create one of the most valuable companies in the world. Also testifying Monday was Todd Maron, Tesla's former general counsel. Maron testified that Musk never dictated terms of the plan, but that the process was cooperative and collaborative, ""not a knock-down, drag-out affair."" ""There would be times when the board wanted something and Elon didn't,"" he said. In his cross-examination of Maron, plaintiff attorney Jeroen van Kwawegen questioned whether the compensation plan was even needed to keep Musk as the helm, noting that there is no evidence he has ever thought about leaving Tesla. 'This is a dicey moment': Amazon, Apple, other tech giants lose billions in value as market wobbles ""I intend to be actively involved with Tesla for the rest of my life,"" Musk said in analyst call in May 2017, just weeks after work on the new compensation plan began. Plaintiff's attorneys pointed to an email to Maron in July 2017 in which Musk said he wanted to use proceeds from the new compensation plan to help finance his dream of colonizing Mars.

A shareholder lawsuit is seeking to void the 2018 compensation package that has paid Musk nearly $50 billion. (Kenny Holston/The New York Times) ..
Elon Musk testified Wednesday that he was not involved in the discussions among Tesla board members about a 2018 pay package that granted him billions of dollars in stock options, helping to make him the world’s richest person.
Speaking in a courtroom in Wilmington, Delaware, Musk pushed back against accusations in a shareholder lawsuit that the electric car company’s board was stacked with friends and other people close to him who did his bidding.
“I was completely focused” on managing Tesla, he said.
The case, in which Musk testified for less than three hours, centers on a compensation package that awarded Musk stock options that gave him the right to acquire nearly $50 billion in Tesla shares if the company met certain revenue, profit and share price gain goals. At the time, the deal was one of the largest of its kind, and it has become a template used by many other corporate boards to reward CEOs.
In court documents, lawyers for the shareholder who brought the case, Richard Tornetta, contend that in April 2017, Musk started to outline the pay deal with a director, Ira Ehrenpreis, who headed the board’s compensation committee. The plaintiff’s lawyers have also said in court filings that Tesla directors and executives said in depositions that the board did not expect Musk to leave the company and had not begun to identify potential successors to him.
On the witness stand, Musk also seemed to rebut a claim in the lawsuit that the shares he already owned in Tesla — about 22% of the company — were incentive enough. Amid an existential struggle to ramp up manufacturing of the company’s first mass-market car, the Model 3, he said he was considering leaving Tesla.
“We were at an inflection point where we had to decide whether I would run the company or someone else would run the company,” Musk said. “I did not want to be CEO.”
Antonio Gracias, who was on Tesla’s board until last year, testified later Wednesday that the board had considered finding someone else to take on the CEO role so that Musk could focus on the company’s products. The board, he added, never found a suitable candidate. “We needed him all the way in, all the time,” said Gracias, who is also on the board of SpaceX, where Musk is also CEO.
In response to questioning on the stand, Gracias said that he had been friends with Musk for more than 20 years and that their families have been on vacations together.
Lawyers for Musk and Tesla directors filed a motion to dismiss the suit, but in 2019, another Delaware judge allowed most of the case to proceed.
The case is being heard by Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery. She also presided over the short-lived lawsuit Twitter filed in July against Musk to force him to go through with the acquisition of the social media company after he sought to back out of the deal. Musk completed the deal last month.
More than a year after the 2018 Tesla pay deal was put in place, the company’s stock started climbing sharply, going from about $21 to a peak of about $410 in November 2021. It has since fallen by more than 50% and now trades at around $187.
In addition to defending himself, Musk used his time on the witness stand to hit some of his favorite talking points, including how Tesla single-handedly created the electric car business and why he loathes the Securities and Exchange Commission and investors who bet against the share prices of Tesla.
“Tesla has had an immense effect on the world,” Musk said in response to a question from a lawyer representing Tesla, Evan Chesler, that appeared designed to show that he had earned his pay. “Not just that Tesla is making electric vehicles, we have been really the main reason why the rest of the car industry has moved toward sustainable, electric vehicles.”
Under questioning by Gregory Varallo, a lawyer representing shareholders, that seemed designed to show that Musk did not always heed authority, Musk lashed out at the SEC. The commission accused him of securities fraud for claiming in August 2018 that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private. To settle that case, Musk stepped down as chair of Tesla, paid a fine and agreed to have a lawyer vet some of his social media posts about Tesla. In April, a federal judge refused a request by Musk to end his agreement with the SEC.
Varallo asked a series of questions designed to show that Musk acts with little oversight from the Tesla board by, for example, deploying the car company’s engineers to help him at Twitter.
“Did someone ever suggest to you that it might not be a good idea to use the resources of a public company for a private company?” Varallo said.
Musk replied that the engineers came voluntarily and did the work on their own time. “It was very short term,” he said. “It lasted for a few days, and then it was over.”
Varallo then asked, “Did any of these so-called independent directors call you and say it might not be a good idea?”
“I don’t believe I received a call,” Musk responded.
James Murdoch, the media executive who has been on Tesla’s board since 2017, testified later Wednesday that the board’s audit committee was aware that Musk had asked Tesla engineers to do volunteer work at Twitter and was monitoring the situation. Murdoch added that he believed most of the work Tesla engineers were doing at Twitter had been finished.
“Shareholders have been rewarded, frankly, in a historic fashion,” Murdoch said about Musk’s leadership of Tesla.
Under questioning, Murdoch acknowledged socializing with Musk, saying their families had spent time together on trips to Jerusalem and Mexico.
In his own testimony, Musk a times spoke quietly and briefly by giving one-word answers to some questions. On other topics, he spoke at length.
At one point relatively early in his testimony, McCormick expressed frustration with Musk’s digressions, saying, “I’m going to interrupt Mr. Musk, because we can all listen to this all day. It’s very interesting, but I don’t think it was responsive to the question, which I’ve now forgotten.”
Musk’s testimony ended around noon. The trial is slated to wrap up at the end of the week. McCormick is expected to rule on the case later, possibly in a few months.

453,16-Nov-22,San Francisco Examiner,Twitter's ongoing train wreck has global implications,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2739011789/BFD812D457A14912PQ/668?accountid=13946,"Headnote
OPINION
If you want to understand how dangerous Elon Musk is, look outside America
With the beneft of ample hindsight, it has come to feel inevitable that Twitter would turn into a cesspool of abuse and misinformation and that the powerful - governments, politicians, corporations, celebrities - would fnd ways to control and manipulate it to their own beneft.
But as I've watched the platform descend into chaos over the past couple of weeks, I've been thinking a lot about how being on Twitter felt back in May 2009, when I arrived in India as a correspondent for the New York Times. I had signed up for an account about six months earlier, but it wasn't until I landed in Delhi that I truly understood the platform's potential.
Twitter was an intoxicating window into my fascinating new assignment. Long suppressed groups found their voices and social media-driven revolutions began to unfold. Movements against corruption gained steam and brought real change. Outrage over a horrifc gang rape in Delhi built a movement to fght an epidemic of sexual violence.
""What we didn't realize - because we took it for granted for so long - is that most people spoke with a great deal of freedom, and completely unconscious freedom,"" said Nilanjana Roy, a writer who was part of my initial group of Twitter friends in India. ""You could criticize the government, debate certain religious practices. It seems unreal now.""
Soon enough, other kinds of underrepresented voices also started to appear on - and then dominate - the platform. As women, Muslims and people from lower castes spoke out, the inevitable backlash came. Supporters of the conservative opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, and their right-wing religious allies felt that they had long been ignored by the mainstream press. Now they had the chance to grab the mic.
And grab it they did. By 2014, when the BJP frst won national elections, driven in no small part by its innovative use of social media to tap into middle-class discontent with the status quo, Indian Twitter was well on its way to becoming one of the world's most vitriolic online spaces, flled with ad homi-nem attacks and incitements to violence. And having used social media so adroitly to win power, the new government realized that controlling platforms like Twitter would be crucial to suppressing dissent.
Into this stew steps Elon Musk.
In buying Twitter, Musk has garbed himself as a free-speech warrior. He had been deeply critical of the company's content moderation decisions, the most controversial of which was blocking Donald Trump from the platform after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.
Viewed from the United States, these skirmishes over the unaccountable power of tech platforms seem like a central battleground of free speech. But the real threat in much of the world is not the policies of social media companies, but of governments.
Nowhere is that clearer than in India, where before Musk's acquisition Twitter had been fghting a legal battle to protect its users from government censorship. The real question now is if Musk's commitment to ""free speech"" extends beyond conservatives in America and to the billions of people in the Global South who rely on the internet for open communication.
Last month, Freedom House released its annual report on freedom on the internet. Allie Funk, one of the researchers who wrote the report, told me that while much of the focus has been on countries like China, which overtly restricts access to huge swaths of the internet, the real war over the future of internet freedom is being waged in what she called ""swing states,"" big, fragile democracies like India.
The winning side will not be decided in Silicon Valley or Beijing, the two poles around which debate over free expression on the internet have largely orbited. It will be the actions of governments in capitals like Abuja, Jakarta, Ankara, Brasília and New Delhi. Across the world, countries are putting in place frameworks that on their face seem designed to combat online abuse and misinformation but are largely used to stife dissent or enable abuse of the enemies of those in power. ""Some laws are introduced with good faith to tackle disinformation and harassment,"" Funk said. ""But other governments are passing laws just to increase their power over speech online and to force companies to be an extension of state surveillance."" For example: requiring companies to house their servers locally rather than abroad, which can make them more vulnerable to government surveillance.
Over the summer, when Musk was still trying to wriggle out of buying Twitter, his lawyers fled a counter-suit against the company that included a grab bag of justifcations for scuttling the deal. One of the claims went largely unnoticed in the United States but caught my eye: His lawyers argued that Twitter had engaged in ""risky litigation against the Indian government,"" and put one of the largest markets in jeopardy.
Twitter had indeed sued the Indian government in July - and for good reasons. In 2021, India had created a raft of rules that gave the government much more power to order technology platforms to remove content on command, and also hold employees of tech platforms criminally liable for speech that appears on their services. Exactly the kind of laws Funk was referring to.
India's government had demanded that Twitter block tweets and accounts from a variety of journalists, activists and politicians. The company went to court, arguing that these demands went beyond the law and into censorship. Now Twitter's potential new owner was casting doubt on whether the company should be defying government demands that muzzle freedom of expression.
Maybe Musk was just trying to escape a purchase that he knew would be disastrous. (And it certainly has been disastrous, at least so far.) But it seems that this is actually what he believes. In April, he tweeted: ""By 'free speech', I simply mean that which matches the law. I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law. If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that efect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people.""
Musk is either exceptionally naive or willfully ignorant about the relationship between government power and free speech, especially in fragile democracies. That should worry anyone who cares about the future of free expression on the internet for billions of people. The combination of a rigid commitment to following national laws and a hands-of approach to content moderation is combustible and highly dangerous.
Independent journalism is increasingly under threat in India. Much of the mainstream press has been neutered by a mix of intimidation and conficts of interests created by the sprawling conglomerates and powerful families that control much of Indian media. Like the United States, India has a big election coming up in 2024. Preserving a free and open public square for debate will be critical to protecting India's democracy.
Twitter has historically fought against censorship. Whether that will continue under Musk seems very much a question. The Indian government has reasons to expect friendly treatment: Musk's company Tesla has been trying to enter the Indian car market for some time, but in May it hit an impasse in negotiations with the government over tarifs and other issues. India's Economic Times reported last month that one of Musk's other companies, SpaceX, would seek government permission to ofer its Starlink satellite internet service there.
As Twitter plunges into ever more mayhem under Musk's erratic management, the big question is whether it will survive at all. I hope it does.
Social media has absolutely deepened polarization and abetted extremism across the globe. But it did so by breaking sclerotic and easily manipulated monopolies on speech. Musk is right that the world needs a digital public square; unfortunately, he seems to have little idea that creating one involves balancing free speech against abuse, misinformation and government overreach. Twitter had just barely managed to get the hang of that difcult, important work in the past couple of years. Musk has left little doubt that rather than continue that work, he'd rather burn it all down.

454,17-Nov-22,The News Journal,Musk in Del. court to defend pay plan: Billionaire CEO's $50 billion Tesla pay package was instituted in 2018,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2736981179/BFD812D457A14912PQ/33?accountid=13946,"It appears even the world's wealthiest individual gripes about his job.
Elon Musk, the billionaire chief executive of electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla and social media company Twitter, was in Wilmington Wednesday to defend in Delaware's Chancery Court his $50 billion Tesla pay package instituted in 2018.
Musk and his security entourage arrived at the courthouse on King Street through the back door. Wearing a black suit and dark tie, Musk, whose net worth well exceeds $100 billion, walked into the courtroom feet away from the courthouse's Justice of the Peace Court where every day Delawareans line up to pay traffic fines and handle other minor legal matters.
He took the stand with a polite greeting from Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick and apologized to those in the room for appearing ""slow"" as he had taken an overnight flight to testify in Delaware.
His testimony was relatively sedate compared with the insults he wielded the last time he was called to testify in Delaware's business court last year.
""I frankly don't want to be (chief executive officer) of any company,"" Musk said during testimony about how long he intended to remain Tesla CEO when the pay plan was instituted.
Musk's testimony came on Day Three of a weeklong trial prompted by a Tesla shareholder seeking to invalidate Musk's pay plan.
The plan gave Musk the ability to acquire Tesla stock as the company achieved different milestones based on metrics like revenue and total value.
Since the plan was initiated, Tesla's value has ballooned from some $50 billion to more than $1 trillion before settling back down to around $600 billion.
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit state that the pay plan was not in the best interest of shareholders, devised and ratified by Musk's friends and sycophants on Tesla's governing board and approved by shareholders only after they were presented ""misleading"" information about the feasibility of the goals.
During testimony, Musk denied having outsized sway over the terms of the plan and attending any meetings in which the plan was discussed by the company's board. He described the company goals tied to the plan as ambitious and unlikely, particularly as the company was teetering on bankruptcy in 2017 as it struggled to produce the Tesla Model 3, the company's first vehicle aimed at a mass market.
Musk said he was ""entirely focused"" on Tesla then and that it was a painful time.
""It's a pain I would not wish to inflict upon anyone,"" Musk said.
The lawsuit partially centers on whether Musk wielded outsized influence over Tesla's board. An attorney for the plaintiffs questioned Musk on some of his work-related stunts, like sending a Tesla into space. Musk called it ""an art piece that will last for millions of years.""
Musk was questioned about whether he consulted the company's board on certain decisions, like naming himself ""Technoking"" of the company.
""I think comedy is legal,"" Musk said upon questioning from the plaintiff's attorney.
The testimony touched on when and how Musk communicated with Tesla board officials about the pay package and how he splits time between the various businesses he leads.
The defendants have argued the pay plan was necessary to keep Musk's attention on growing Tesla while he also had leadership roles in other companies.
Plaintiffs have argued that was unnecessary as Musk already owned a significant portion of the company before the 2018 pay plan.
While the lawsuit centers on his pay package from Tesla, his recent acquisition of Twitter and years of tweets also featured heavily during testimony.
Most recently, Musk said his time had been dominated by Twitter, which he acquired for $46 billion last month. Since then, he's been criticized over changes critics say enable lies and hate speech to proliferate, and 50% of the company's workforce has been cut or quit, including many top executives.
On questioning, he said he intends to redirect his focus from Twitter once the company's basic structure is fixed, which he said should be done by the end of the week.
While not overly combative toward the plaintiff's attorney, Musk's testimony touched on one of his old foes, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which fined Musk in 2018 for tweets speculating about taking Tesla private.
""The SEC continues to haunt me despite shareholders being greatly rewarded,"" Musk said.
He did spar with the plaintiff's attorney's insistence that Musk answer yes or no questions with a single word.
""You are asking complex questions that can't be answered with 'yes' or 'no,'"" Musk said, calling such questions misleading.
At one point, McCormick, the judge, chided Musk for his long elaborations.
""We can all listen to this all day. It's very interesting, but I don't think it was responsive to the question, which I've now forgotten,"" McCormick told Musk.
The testimony lasted only three hours, and Musk departed the courthouse flanked by his entourage without responding to calls for comment on the case.

455,17-Nov-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Has the Next Tesla CEO in Mind. There Are a Few Candidates.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2736902203/BFD812D457A14912PQ/75?accountid=13946,"Tesla board member James Murdoch said Elon Musk knows who could run Tesla after him. It might have been a throwaway line said while being questioned in a trial. Still, it's a chance for investors to consider who's next.
Murdoch is a Tesla (ticker: TSLA) board member and appeared in a Delaware court Wednesday in connection with a shareholder lawsuit about Musk's $50 billion-plus pay package awarded back in 2019. The pay package will give Musk roughly 300 million shares, at a price of about $23 a piece, if certain milestones are hit. That is about 10% of the company. Tesla has roughly 3 billion shares outstanding.
Whether the suit succeeds or not isn't really all that big a deal for Tesla investors. A win for plaintiffs means that Musk exerts a lot of control at Tesla and on Tesla's board. Investors just won't be shocked or concerned by that outcome. And if Musk loses his options Tesla's board will have to do something else.
As long as Musk doesn't quit out of frustration, the Delaware trial isn't a Tesla stock-moving event.
Who runs Tesla, or any company, is always a stock-moving event.
Musk was asked about succession at the August meeting of shareholders. ""I intend to stay at Tesla as long as I can be useful,"" said the CEO, adding ""I think [Tesla has] got a very bright future even without me."" and, ""I'm not leaving, just to be clear.""
But a transition will happen some day. One question for investors to consider is if the next CEO will come from outside or inside the company.
One outsider that is available is former Volkswagen (VOW. Germany) CEO Herbert Diess. Musk seems comfortable with Diess, even appearing at a Volkswagen management event hosted by Diess in October 2021. Musk also praised Diess for ""moving VW rapidly toward electrification"" back in April.
Other outside candidates might have Tesla ties such as Tesla co-founder J.B. Straubel. He left Tesla back in 2019 and now runs EV materials company Redwood Materials .
Any list of insider candidates has to start with Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn and engineering head Drew Baglino. Those are the two executives listed alongside Musk in annual filings.
There are other long-serving Tesla executives, such as vehicle engineering VP Lars Moravy and sales VP Troy Jones, but investors don't know a lot about them because they don't speak at investor conferences and events.
Murdoch's comment could spur a list with any number of candidates. All of this is still only speculation. His answer in court might have been designed to show Tesla's board thinks about management succession. That is a job for any board of directors.
Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment about management succession.
Tesla stock dropped about 3.9% Wednesday while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell about 0.8% and 1.5%, respectively.
Succession probably didn't cause any underperformance. Investors were probably following the broader market as well as news of more EV price cuts in China. China is a significant market for Tesla, it's the largest market for EVs on the planet and Tesla generates about one-quarter of company sales in the country.
Tesla shares were down another 0.6% in premarket trading Thursday. S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively.

456,17-Nov-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Witness Says Musk Floated Possibility Of a Tesla Successor,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2736981666/BFD812D457A14912PQ/94?accountid=13946,"WILMINGTON, Del. -- Elon Musk recently floated the possibility of someone succeeding him as Tesla Inc. chief executive, a board member said Wednesday while testifying in a trial over the CEO's pay package at the electric-vehicle maker.
The board member, James Murdoch, said Mr. Musk in recent months identified a potential successor who could serve as CEO of Tesla. Mr. Murdoch didn't identify that person.
The comment by Mr. Murdoch is a sign Mr. Musk may be thinking about Tesla's next chapter. As recently as last year, Mr. Musk said Tesla didn't have a succession plan.
Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. Mr. Musk said in August, at the company's annual shareholder meeting, that he intended to stay at Tesla as long as he could be useful. He has often expressed a distaste for being CEO, a perspective he reprised on the stand Wednesday.
Mr. Musk, who runs Twitter Inc. and rocket company SpaceX, in addition to Tesla Inc., during the trial said, ""I expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time."" He also said he has been spending the lion's share of his time recently running the social-media company, which he acquired last month for $44 billion.
Mr. Musk added that he expected ""the fundamental organizational restructuring"" of Twitter to be completed soon.
He recently raised the possibility of bankruptcy for Twitter, has laid off around 50% of the social-media platform's staff and tried to implement various product changes. Minutes before beginning his testimony, Mr. Musk was tweeting about Twitter.
Mr. Musk was on the stand in Delaware's business-law court because of a shareholder lawsuit over his 2018 pay package, worth around $50 billion at recent share prices.
Richard Tornetta, a Tesla shareholder, is seeking to nullify Mr. Musk's grant, alleging that the CEO controlled the board's consideration of his pay package and that the board failed to disclose crucial information to shareholders, who signed off on it.
Mr. Musk said he didn't dictate the terms of his pay plan and was focused on running the business. ""I was entirely focused on the execution of the company,"" he said.
Mr. Musk said he has divided his time between his endeavors, with Tesla and SpaceX taking up most of his time when Tesla was considering his latest grant. In recent years, Tesla has consumed more of Mr. Musk's time than his other businesses have, he said.
""CEO is often viewed as somewhat of a business-focused role, but in reality my role is much more that of an engineer developing technology,"" Mr. Musk said.
Tesla's board at times has considered whether Mr. Musk would better serve Tesla in the role of chief product officer, rather than CEO, but couldn't find anyone to replace him, former board member Antonio Gracias said Wednesday.
Mr. Musk, who doesn't receive a salary from Tesla, has secured all but one of the 12 tranches of options available under his 2018 grant based on Tesla's having achieved various milestones. Tesla's market capitalization has increased more than 10-fold since shareholders signed off on the CEO's pay package in March 2018, helping it become the world's most valuable car maker, while making Mr. Musk the globe's wealthiest person.
An attorney for the plaintiff, who has accused Tesla's board of misleading shareholders about Mr. Musk's package, on Tuesday displayed Tesla records showing that internal projections at the time forecast the company would soon achieve some of the targets that the company described in 2018 as ""challenging"" and ""difficult to achieve.""
Mr. Musk said meeting some of the goals was ""extremely unlikely."" Mr. Gracias later said of certain Tesla financial projections made in 2017 and 2018: ""These were our stretch, stretch goals.""
The cross-examination of Mr. Musk at times turned combative as a plaintiff's attorney pressed Mr. Musk to provide shorter answers and the CEO challenged the questioning.
At one point the presiding judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, cut off a lengthy explanation by Mr. Musk. The judge also presided over Twitter's lawsuit seeking to compel Mr. Musk to buy the social-media company. That transaction closed before the case went to trial.
At one point Mr. Musk asked, ""Are we in the Tesla trial or the Twitter trial?"" after a plaintiff's attorney reviewed certain management changes Mr. Musk made upon taking over the social-media company.
The plaintiff's attorney later asked Mr. Musk if he was a trained lawyer. ""I have some familiarity with the legal system,"" Mr. Musk said. ""If you're in enough lawsuits, you pick up a few things along the way.""
Tesla Chair Robyn Denholm, board member Ira Ehrenpreis, former Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja and former General Counsel Todd Maron testified ahead of Mr. Musk.
Ms. McCormick, the judge in the five-day, nonjury trial, isn't expected to issue a verdict for months after the trial concludes.

457,17-Nov-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Says He'll Find Someone to Run Twitter. Tesla Stock May Benefit.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2737111934/BFD812D457A14912PQ/127?accountid=13946,"Tesla investors have been reeling since Elon Musk took over Twitter, worried about all the time their CEO was spending at his social-media platform. There is also the potential brand damage Musk might do to his car company while making tough decisions designed to turn Twitter's performance around.
Tesla (ticker: TSLA) investors might stop thinking about a Twitter wildcard in the near future. Apparently, Musk is looking for help.
The overhang is real—and painful. Tesla stock is down roughly 17% since Musk took over Twitter. The Nasdaq Composite is up about 4% over the same span.
Investors have reacted with nervousness, while Musk dramatically laid off staff and tweeted some questionable things . He also insisted Twitter needed a technologist, like himself, and not a person with more media experience.
That view might be softening. Musk testified in a Delaware courtroom Wednesday. The trial had nothing to do with Twitter. It was about Musk's $50 billion-plus pay package awarded back in 2019. The topic of Twitter came up, though.
Musk said he was looking for someone to run Twitter, according to reports coming from the courtroom. Twitter and Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment about Musk's comments at the trial.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives tweeted ""This is very, very good and welcomed news"" on Wednesday. He covered Twitter before the buyout. He still covers Tesla stock, rating the shares a Buy. His price target is $250. He cut his target price to that level from $300 about a week ago, calling Twitter an ""albatross"" for Tesla stock.
The Street likes the news. Help at Twitter should also be music to the ears of Tesla investors who don't fully agree with Musk's assessment of Twitter's needs. ""Since Elon is the tech guy, he needs someone who can talk to advertisers about platform efficacy,"" says Future Fund Active exchange-traded fund (FFND) co-founder, and Tesla shareholder, Gary Black .
Musk has lamented the loss of advertising revenue since he took over, at one point blaming activist groups for pressuring advertisers.
He want to generate more sales from subscriptions—such as the $8 monthly fee for a blue ""verified"" check mark that confers some legitimacy to a Twitter account. But that's a log row to hoe. Black points out advertising made up 92% of sales in the second quarter.
If Musk is warming to the idea of a person with more media experience former T-Mobile US (TMUS) CEO John Legere could be a good choice. ""John is the perfect person to help,"" says Gerber Kawasaki Wealth Management CEO Ross Gerber .
Musk didn't seem to like that idea though tweeting "" Um…no "" on Monday in response to Legere's name.
Gerber also recommends Kevin Mayer. He built Disney+ and has credibility with advertisers. ""I'm trying to get him to replace himself as 'Chief Twit' and get a great media CEO,"" adds Gerber. ""Elon should be running the tech, not the business, he doesn't seem to understand media at all.""
Gerber is literally invested in how Twitter runs. He still owns a part of Twitter since he kept his stake in the social-media platform when Musk took it private. Musk has other investors with him too. It reduced the amount of his own money he needed to put in to complete the purchase. The exact number of people investing along side Musk in Twitter isn't known.
Gerber owns Tesla stock too. Most Tesla investors, however, don't really care what happens at Twitter. They just want the overhang to go away.
A new media-savvy CEO or manager for Twitter would eat into that 21 percentage point underperformance separating Tesla stock and the Nasdaq Composite.
Tesla stock dropped almost 4% on Wednesday, closing at under $187. Investors might have been paying attention more to EV price cuts in China or the broader market—the S&P 500 fell 0.8%—than a trial about an old issue. Investors shouldn't tune out Musk, though. He's proven himself capable of doing the unexpected, and quickly.

At the time, the deal was one of the largest of its kind, and it has become a template used by many other corporate boards to reward chief executives.In court documents, lawyers for the shareholder who brought the case, Richard Tornetta, contend that in April 2017 Mr. Musk started to outline the pay deal with a director, Ira Ehrenpreis, who headed the board's compensation committee. The plaintiff's lawyers have also said in court filings that Tesla directors and executives said in depositions that the board did not expect Mr. Musk to leave the company and had not begun to identify potential successors to him.On the witness stand, Mr. Musk also seemed to rebut a claim in the lawsuit that the shares he already owned in Tesla -- about 22 percent of the company -- were incentive enough. Amid an existential struggle to ramp up manufacturing of the company's first mass-market car, the Model 3, he said he was considering leaving Tesla.""We were at an inflection point where we had to decide whether I would run the company or someone else would run the company,"" Mr. Musk said. ""I did not want to be C.E.O.""Antonio Gracias, who was on Tesla's board until last year, testified later on Wednesday that the board had considered finding someone else to take on the chief executive role so that Mr. Musk could focus on the company's products. The board, he added, never found a suitable candidate.""We needed him all the way in, all the time,"" said Mr. Gracias, who is also on the board of SpaceX, where Mr. Musk is also chief executive.In response to questioning on the stand, Mr. Gracias said that he had been friends with Mr. Musk for more than 20 years and that their families had been on vacations together.Lawyers for Mr. Musk and Tesla directors filed a motion to dismiss the suit, but in 2019, another Delaware judge allowed most of the case to proceed.The case is being heard by Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Delaware Court of Chancery. She also presided over the short-lived lawsuit Twitter filed in July against Mr. Musk to force him to go through with the acquisition of the social media company after he sought to back out of the deal. Mr. Musk completed the deal last month.More than a year after the 2018 Tesla pay deal was put in place, the company's stock started climbing sharply, going from about $21 to a peak of about $410 last November. It has since fallen more than 50 percent and trades around $187.In addition to defending himself, Mr. Musk used his time on the witness stand to hit some of his favorite talking points, including how Tesla single-handedly created the electric car business and why he loathes the Securities and Exchange Commission and investors who bet against the share prices of Tesla.""Tesla has had an immense effect on the world,"" Mr. Musk said in response to a question from a lawyer representing Tesla, Evan Chesler, that appeared designed to show that he had earned his pay. ""Not just that Tesla is making electric vehicles -- we have been really the main reason why the rest of the car industry has moved toward sustainable, electric vehicles.""Under questioning by Gregory Varallo, a lawyer representing shareholders, that seemed designed to show that Mr. Musk did not always heed authority, Mr. Musk lashed out at the S.E.C. The commission accused him of securities fraud for claiming in August 2018 that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private. To settle that case, Mr. Musk stepped down as chairman of Tesla, paid a fine and agreed to have a lawyer vet some of his social media posts about Tesla. In April, a federal judge refused a request by Mr. Musk to end his agreement with the S.E.C.Mr. Varallo asked a series of questions designed to show that Mr. Musk acts with little oversight from the Tesla board by, for example, deploying the car company's engineers to help him at Twitter.""Did someone ever suggest to you that it might not be a good idea to use the resources of a public company for a private company?"" Mr. Varallo said.Mr. Musk replied that the engineers came voluntarily and did the work on their own time. ""It was very short term,"" he said. ""It lasted for a few days, and then it was over.""Mr. Varallo then asked: ""Did any of these so-called independent directors call you and say it might not be a good idea?""""I don't believe I received a call,"" Mr. Musk responded.James Murdoch, the media executive who has been on Tesla's board since 2017, testified later on Wednesday that the board's audit committee was aware that Mr. Musk had asked Tesla engineers to do volunteer work at Twitter and was monitoring the situation. Mr. Murdoch added that he believed most of the work Tesla engineers were doing at Twitter had been finished.""Shareholders have been rewarded, frankly, in a historic fashion,"" Mr. Murdoch said about Mr. Musk's leadership of Tesla.Under questioning, Mr. Murdoch acknowledged socializing with Mr. Musk, saying their families had spent time together on trips to Jerusalem and Mexico.In his own testimony, Mr. Musk at times spoke quietly and briefly by giving one-word answers to some questions. On other topics, he spoke at length.At one point relatively early in his testimony, Chancellor McCormick expressed frustration with Mr. Musk's digressions, saying: ""I'm going to interrupt Mr. Musk, because we can all listen to this all day. It's very interesting, but I don't think it was responsive to the question, which I've now forgotten.""Mr. Musk's testimony ended around noon. The trial is slated to wrap up at the end of the week. Chancellor McCormick is expected to rule on the case later, possibly in a few months.PhotographElon Musk arriving at court in Wilmington, Del., on Wednesday to testify in a shareholder suit questioning how Tesla's board determined his 2018 compensation.

459,17-Nov-22,Los Angeles Times,BUSINESS; Musk tells staff: Accept 'hardcore culture' -- or else,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2736965327/BFD812D457A14912PQ/695?accountid=13946,"Twitter boss Elon Musk issued a staffwide ultimatum Tuesday evening: Either commit to the new ""hardcore culture"" of Twitter 2.0 or leave with three months' severance. Employees have until 5 p.m. Eastern time Thursday to opt in or out, according to an email Musk sent to staff as first reported by the Washington Post.
In some ways, Musk's ultimatum is the most explicit articulation yet of what he expects from Twitter's remaining workforce since his Oct. 28 takeover of the company. ""This will mean working long hours at high intensity,"" he said in the email.
Although it's clear that Musk intends to force a massive Twitter culture makeover, what's less clear is how much damage his actions will inflict in the long term.

This latest move comes after Musk sowed weeks of uncertainty and fear among Twitter's ranks. Staffers saw Musk lay off thousands of their colleagues at the start of November. The exodus then continued with more managers and employees resigning every day and the ax falling on anyone who spoke out against Musk's new regime, publicly or, reportedly, on internal channels.
Since Musk took control of the company, he has quickly enacted controversial changes, including ending Twitter's work-from-home policy, introducing a new paid verification subscription feature and overhauling the way the platform does content moderation.
On Monday, Musk appeared to fire via tweet a software engineer who disagreed with him on Twitter over why the app was slow on Android.
He has fired nearly two dozen employees who pushed back privately or publicly against him, ordering his team to comb through employees' internal chats and tweets, the New York Times reported.
In a snarky reply to one user who shared the news of these firings, Musk tweeted, ""I would like to apologize for firing these geniuses. Their immense talent will no doubt be of great use elsewhere.""
He insulted another former employee who appeared to have been fired for their social media posts, replying, ""A tragic case of adult onset Tourette's.""
Company culture experts who've been watching the ordeal from afar say that although Musk is being intentional about remaking Twitter's culture, his actions will come at a cost -- at least in the short term.
""We [as CEOs] really want people who are on board with us,"" said Casey Cunningham, founder and chief executive of Atlanta-based leadership and professional development company Xinnix. ""We want people who are attached to the mission, who are forward-thinking and want to drive it forward.""
The way Musk has publicly fired and ridiculed Twitter employees is not productive for the company, she said.
""I would caution any CEO from publicly embarrassing or ridiculing employees that are leaving,"" Cunningham said. ""The reality is, you might need them someday.""
Indeed, Twitter has already reached out to dozens of laid-off workers and asked them to return. It could be a hard ask, some experts say, given the culture that Musk is setting at the company.
""Elon is deciding what kind of culture he wants and he's creating it,"" said Logan Mallory, vice president of marketing at Motivosity, an employee engagement platform in Lehi, Utah. The firings ""will push lots of people away and it will draw other types of talent to him and to Twitter. It's harder to rehire, it's harder to retain the talent that's still there, you'll lose customers,"" he said.
It's clear that Musk's moves have rattled a good chunk of Twitter's remaining employees, if LinkedIn is any indication. Out of about 7,900 people who listed Twitter as their current employer on LinkedIn, 3,300 have ""open to work"" displaying on their profiles, said Andrew Esguerra, Los Angeles-area manager for recruiting agency Coda Search & Staffing, though that number may include recently laid-off workers.
The hard-driving work environment may deter top-tier engineers looking for cushy jobs with good benefits, such as being able to work from home, Esguerra said. However, the state of the tech job market -- given recent mass layoffs at Meta, Amazon and other companies -- may make it difficult for employees to be too picky about their job options for the time being.
At the same time, other industry watchers argue that some culture shock was to be expected at Twitter and this is simply Musk's way of pushing the initial ""reset"" button. As such, they say the collateral damage won't be permanent.
Musk's email makes clear the kind of Twitter he's trying to build while giving employees a way out, said Chris Rice, a partner in recruiting company Riviera Partners' Boston office.
""He's going to build an essential high-performance team that believes in his vision,"" Rice said. ""I think that ... once they get to a point where the core product is moving forward in Elon's vision, I would imagine we would start to see things to increase the culture and retainability of top talent start to appear.""
Rice pointed out that Musk has not had a problem recruiting talent for his other companies, such as Tesla and SpaceX, which he said employ the ""best brains in industry.""
Musk's transparency, Mallory said, could lure ""part of the talent pool that can find success in stressful environments"" and seek a meritocracy where performance is rewarded the most.
""While the culture is not for everyone, there is a group who will want high work, high performance and high reward, and they won't shy away from the culture that Elon is creating,"" Mallory said.
Despite his track record as a toxic boss, Musk still receives the benefit of the doubt from many, based on his reputation and record of accomplishments. Eric Schiffer, an L.A.-based entrepreneur and expert in reputation and crisis management, said there are still many people attracted to Musk's image as a ""free-thinking visionary"" and industry disrupter.
""Elon Musk has his own brand and style of leadership that is ubiquitous and accepted by those within his organizations,"" Schiffer said. ""Those that know Elon Musk's style understand clearly what they're getting into.""

Plus, USA TODAY senior data journalist Doug Caruso looks at how climate change will test the country's dam infrastructure. Podcasts: True crime, in-depth interviews and more USA TODAY podcasts right here. Hit play on the player above to hear the podcast and follow along with the transcript below. This transcript was automatically generated, and then edited for clarity in its current form. There may be some differences between the audio and the text. Taylor Wilson: Good morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Thursday, the 17th of November 2022. Today, where Biden and NATO stand after a missile kills civilians in Poland. Plus, how many dams are failing in the US, and the Senate makes progress on marriage equality. ♦ Leaders of Poland and NATO said yesterday that the missile that killed two people in Poland was not a Russian attack. That eases fears of a potentially escalated war in Europe. But what will the Biden administration's response be? USA TODAY White House correspondent Michael Collins has been tracking this story and joins me now. Michael, thanks for being here. Michael Collins: Thanks for having me. Taylor Wilson: So how did the Biden administration react to this missile strike? Michael Collins: Poland is a NATO country. NATO's charter indicates that when there is an attack against one NATO member, it's considered an attack against all NATO members. So if, in fact, this had been a deliberate attack against Poland, then the United States and other NATO members would have been obligated to respond in some fashion. Taylor Wilson:| Michael, was there any difference between the US response and that of some countries in Europe? Michael Collins: The Polish government has come out and said that they do not believe that it was fired by Russia. They believe that it was an intercept missile that was fired by Ukraine, that somehow went awry and ended up in Poland. The Russian government, of course, says that they did not fire this missile. And they were very critical of Poland for suggesting that this missile was fired by Russia, and could have been a deliberate attack on Poland. And they were very critical of that. And the Russians, surprisingly, had somewhat good things to say about President Biden. They praiseD him for his restrained response. They said it was a much more professional reaction than the leader of Poland, and some of these other countries, had at the beginning of this attack. Taylor Wilson: So what happens next, Michael? What's the Biden administration's plan as it pertains to NATO responsibilities surrounding this incident? Michael Collins: I think one of the things that you are going to be hearing in the coming days and weeks is that the finger is still going to be pointed at Russia, regardless of whether or not Russia fired this missile. You're already hearing members of the Biden administration, and NATO, and others, say that while Russia may not have fired this missile and it may have been fired by Ukraine, Russia is to blame because this was an unprovoked war by Russia against Ukraine. Taylor Wilson: Michael, thanks so much for making the time. Michael Collins: Thank you so much for having me. Taylor Wilson: You can follow along with the war in Ukraine with our live updates page on USATODAY.com. ♦ There are over 91,000 dams in the United States, and more than 200 of them have failed in foul weather since 2000. Producer PJ Elliott spoke with USA TODAY'S senior data journalist, Doug Caruso, to find out how climate change and severe weather will test the country's dam infrastructure. Doug Caruso: What we saw in the data that we studied is an increase in the frequency of storms. So what we were looking at was places where the likelihood of certain storms is going up, so you're getting more of them. And it has a dam that, if it breaks, would kill somebody. And then the third thing is the dam in poor or unsatisfactory condition. We found 3,000 dams that met all of those categories. PJ Elliott: Doug, what is the cause of the frequency of the storms increasing? Doug Caruso: That's climate change related. This data came from the University of Wisconsin, and calculates the change since 1995 in the frequency of these storms. And then predicts that those increases in frequency are going to continue to rise as the climate warms. PJ Elliott: Is there a certain area of the country that's being affected more than others? Doug Caruso: Yeah, the main area we're looking at is east of the Rocky Mountains. That's where things are really becoming wetter. PJ Elliott: Doug, obviously, this is an infrastructure problem on top of a climate change problem. But I want to ask if the bipartisan bill that Congress passed last year has anything allocated to help fix these dams? Doug Caruso: That package has $3 billion in it for dams. About half a billion dollars of that is earmarked specifically for high hazard dams. Those are the dams that would kill somebody if they break. But the American Society of Dam Safety Officials has said that the actual need for high hazard dams is more in the $24 billion category. Taylor Wilson: You can find a link to the full story in today's show description. ♦ Protections for gay marriage rights crossed a major threshold yesterday, when the Senate defeated a filibuster and set the stage for the Respect for Marriage Act to pass. For more on the bill, I'm now joined by USA TODAY national political reporter Mabinty Quarshie. Mabinty, thanks for being here. Mabinty Quarshie: Thank you so much, Taylor. I always love chatting with you. Taylor Wilson: So, Mabinty, tell us about this legislation? Mabinty Quarshie: So what the Respect for Marriage Act does is it doesn't quite codify same sex marriage. I want to make that very clear. What it does do is it says that if you get married, say in California, and then you move to Virginia or North Carolina, what that means is that your marriage will be recognized in any state, no matter where you got married, as long as it was legal. The Respect for Marriage Act, it doesn't just also protect same sex marriage. I think what gets lost is it also protects interracial marriages. Taylor Wilson: What are the roots of this bill, and what happens next? Mabinty Quarshie: So after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade back in June, there was a lot of concern from LGBTQ advocates, and the community, that gay marriage could be the next protection that was overturned. So there was a lot of pressure on Democrats to pass a law to protect same sex marriage. And back in July, Democrats in the House, they did vote on a same sex marriage bill and it was passed. But, then, Congress struck a deal, where they said they'd wait until after the midterm elections to vote on the Respect for Marriage Act. Because there was concern that they wouldn't have the votes to pass this bill. And so, what happened on Monday of this week, is that a group of bipartisan senators unveiled legislation that showed they did have the extra 10 votes that they would need, in addition to the 50 votes from Democrats, to bypass the filibuster in the Senate. And that is what happened on Wednesday. Senators voted 62-37 to move the Respect for Marriage Act to the Senate for an up or down vote. And we think that vote will come soon, but we're not quite sure. It could come as early as Friday, or it could be pushed back to next week. Taylor Wilson: Mabinty Quarshie, thanks so much for stopping by. Mabinty Quarshie: Thank you. ♦ Taylor Wilson: In just three weeks after taking over Twitter, Elon Musk has laid off thousands of workers, abruptly ended the company's remote work policy, and fired employees that criticized him. Now, this week, Musk is giving employees an ultimatum: either commit to a hardcore work environment or leave. PJ Elliott spoke with USA TODAY tech reporter, Riley Gutierrez McDermid, to find out how the tweeps reacted to their new boss's plan. Riley Gutierrez McDermid: The only way that I could describe their reaction is they're just laughing in disbelief. There have just been so many things that have had these whiplash turns since Elon Musk took over the company, that they don't know what to take seriously and what not to take seriously. I think that they look at this as maybe another one of those blue check mark verification moments. Which is, right now, in the middle of the night, he's saying, ""You have to sign this loyalty pledge."" Or if this, too, will be walked back. Elon Musk has a history of shooting from the hip and paying the consequences later. PJ Elliott: So is all this sending a message out to the marketplace that we're returning to the office full time, and it's okay to start working employees to the bone again? Riley Gutierrez McDermid: I think it's tricky to extrapolate from Elon Musk, and the antics that he has, to every single sector. That being said, he has been a disruptive force in other industries that he's entered before. Tesla, very famously, is anti-union. And for an automaker - especially one with a large presence in Detroit, competing against American automakers - to not have a union presence was anathema for a long time. But they've stayed that way, and they manage to attract talent, one way or the other. He's very much a libertarian in terms of how he believes people should be compensated and how the free market should work. So I think you can safely say that if you work for Elon Musk, a work-life balance is not a phrase that you're going to hear much of.

Robert E. Lee, a leading Confederate general, had his name removed from 17 schools. While another Confederate general, Stonewall Jackson, was removed from eight. In northern states, according to a review of federal data, few schools were named after Confederate figures. But some schools voted to drop the names of controversial presidents, like James Buchanan, who failed to challenge the spread of slavery immediately before the Civil War. Other states changed names from governors and local politicians who defended slavery. And, in Minnesota, two schools removed the name Henry Sibley, after evidence that he massacred Native Dakota people. Calls for removing these namesakes aren't new. But Hilary Green, the James B. Duke professor of Africana studies at Davidson College, told USA TODAY that Floyd's murder accelerated the conversation.

461,19-Nov-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Tesla Board's View That Elon Musk Is Irreplaceable Emerged in Pay Trial; Desire to keep serial entrepreneur focused on car maker contributed to pursuit of multibillion-dollar equity grant,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2737729747/BFD812D457A14912PQ/174?accountid=13946,"A weeklong trial in Delaware focused on Elon Musk's compensation package and the deal that led to it. PHOTO: Rachel Wisniewski for The Wall Street Journal
WILMINGTON, Del.—The scale of concern among Tesla Inc. board members about how to keep Elon Musk's attention trained on the electric-vehicle maker loomed large during a weeklong trial over the chief executive's pay package.
A desire to motivate Mr. Musk to focus on Tesla triggered a monthslong pay negotiation that culminated in the shareholders' approval of a 2018 CEO equity grant valued at roughly $48 billion at recent stock prices.
That deal—and the process under which it was put together—have been the subject of the trial in Delaware's business-law court, where testimony has underscored that current and former Tesla board members have long viewed Mr. Musk as irreplaceable.
Mr. Musk, for his part, recently identified someone as a possible successor to him as CEO, the board member James Murdoch testified, signaling that the serial entrepreneur might be thinking about Tesla's next chapter. Mr. Musk said last year that Tesla didn't have a succession plan.
Board members' focus around 2017 on ensuring that Mr. Musk would remain engaged in Tesla stemmed from his many other interests, including running the rocket company SpaceX.
The drag on Mr. Musk's time at the car maker has only become more pronounced with his $44 billion acquisition late last month of Twitter Inc. Mr. Musk, at the trial, said he has recently been spending much of his time running the social-media company, though he doesn't expect that to be the case in the long term.
""I expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time,"" he said in the Court of Chancery.
Mr. Musk's ownership of Twitter has been defined by near-constant workforce upheaval, with a new wave of departures on Thursday after many employees rejected Mr. Musk's demand that they commit to working ""long hours at high intensity."" Mr. Musk recently raised the possibility of bankruptcy for the social-media business.
Neither Tesla nor Twitter responded to a request for comment.
The plaintiff in the case, Richard Tornetta, a Tesla shareholder, sued current and former company board members in seeking to nullify Mr. Musk's 2018 pay package. Mr. Tornetta alleges that the CEO controlled the board's consideration of his grant, that the board failed to disclose crucial information to shareholders and that the package failed to motivate Mr. Musk to focus on Tesla.
Mr. Musk echoed current and former Tesla officials in saying that he didn't dictate the terms of his pay plan. ""I was entirely focused on the execution of the company,"" he testified.
Mr. Musk said he has divided his time between his endeavors, with Tesla and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., as SpaceX is formally known, taking up most of his time when the car maker's board was considering the grant.
""CEO is often viewed as somewhat of a business-focused role, but in reality my role is much more that of an engineer developing technology,"" Mr. Musk said.
The pay deal requires Mr. Musk to remain either CEO or chief product officer and executive chairman for the tranches to vest, but doesn't stipulate that he must dedicate a specific amount of time to the car maker. During the trial, he and other Tesla board members rejected any suggestion that the pay deal should have done so. In September 2018, Mr. Musk agreed to step down from his role as Tesla's chairman in a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
""I'm not concerned about the amount of time that he spends,"" Robyn Denholm, who is chair of Tesla's board, testified remotely. ""He will do whatever he needs to do to achieve the results.""
Tesla's board from time to time discussed finding someone else to run the company, former board member Antonio Gracias testified, adding, ""We couldn't find anyone.""
In his first days running Twitter, Mr. Musk blurred the lines between the social-media company and his car maker, bringing in Tesla employees on a volunteer basis to review Twitter's engineering talent, he said in court.
""It was very short-term,"" Mr. Musk said. ""It lasted for a few days or so.""
Tesla's audit committed has discussed the matter, Mr. Murdoch said, adding that Tesla officials don't want the work to take away from employees' duties at the electric-vehicle maker. Mr. Murdoch is the younger son of Rupert Murdoch, the executive chairman of News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal.
Mr. Musk, who doesn't receive a salary from Tesla, has secured all but one of the 12 tranches of options available under his 2018 grant based on Tesla's achievement of various milestones. Tesla's market capitalization has increased about 10-fold since shareholders signed off on the CEO's pay package, helping the company become the world's most valuable car maker, while making Mr. Musk the world's wealthiest person.
Much of the trial has focused on the potential for achieving the performance targets that underpin Mr. Musk's pay package. Attorneys for the plaintiff have argued that Tesla's internal forecasts at the time contemplated the company soon clearing some of the hurdles required for Mr. Musk's grant to vest.
Mr. Musk said meeting some of the performance goals was extremely unlikely, a view that aligned with statements made by other board members.
""Those market-cap goals were totally insane,"" Brad Buss, a former Tesla board member, testified. ""If he didn't perform, there would be nothing paid.""
Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who is presiding in the nonjury trial, is expected to issue a verdict in the coming months. She also presided over Twitter's lawsuit seeking to compel Mr. Musk to buy the social-media company. That transaction closed before the case went to trial.

 Tesla Board's View That Elon Musk Is Irreplaceable Emerged in Pay Trial

462,21-Nov-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",What Elon Musk Is Doing to Twitter Is What He Did at Tesla and SpaceX,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2738271060/BFD812D457A14912PQ/224?accountid=13946,"FILE — Employees on the Model 3 assembly line at Tesla's Factory in Fremont, Calif., on June 28, 2018. Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, once slept at a factory to ramp up production of the car. (Justin Kaneps/The New York Times).

Elon Musk was sleeping at the office. He dismissed employees and executives at will. And he lamented his company was on the verge of bankruptcy.
That was back in 2018 and the company was Tesla, as Musk’s electric automaker struggled to build its mass-market vehicle, the Model 3.
“It was excruciating,” he told The New York Times at the time. “There were times when I didn’t leave the factory for three or four days — days when I didn’t go outside.”
The billionaire’s experience with what he called Tesla’s “production hell” has become a blueprint for the crisis he has created at Twitter, which he bought for $44 billion last month. Over the years, Musk has developed a playbook for managing his companies — including Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX — through periods of pain, employing shock treatment and alarmism and pushing his workers and himself to put aside their families and friends to spend all their energy on his mission.
At Twitter, Musk has used many of those same tactics to upend the social media company in just a few weeks.
Since late last month, the 51-year-old has laid off 50% of Twitter’s 7,500 employees and accepted the resignations of 1,200 or more. On Monday, he began another round of layoffs, two people said. He tweeted that he was sleeping at Twitter’s offices in San Francisco. And he has applied mission-driven language, telling Twitter’s workers that the company could go bankrupt if he wasn’t able to turn it around. Those who want to work on “Twitter 2.0” must commit to his “hard core” vision in writing, he has said.
David Deak, who worked at Tesla from 2014 to 2016 as a senior engineering manager overseeing a supply chain for battery materials, said Musk “clearly thrives in existential circumstances.” He added, “He quasi creates them to light the fire under everybody.”
The similarities between Musk’s approach to Twitter and what he did at Tesla and SpaceX are evident, added Tammy Madsen, a management professor at Santa Clara University. But it’s unclear if he will find the means to motivate employees at a social media company as he did with workers whose quests were to move people away from gas-powered cars or send humans into space.
“At Tesla and SpaceX, the approach has always been high risk, high reward,” Madsen said. “Twitter has been high risk, but the question is: What is the reward that comes out of it?”
Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
On Sunday, Musk held a meeting with Twitter’s sales employees, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Then on Monday, he laid off employees in the sales department, they said. Late last week, Musk fired Robin Wheeler, a top sales executive, they added. Bloomberg earlier reported that more layoffs might be coming.
Twitter is also reaching out to some engineers who quit to ask them to return, the people said. In a meeting with employees Monday, Musk said the company was not planning any further layoffs, according to one person who attended.
At companies led by Musk, the pattern of claiming that the firms are on the brink of a potential bankruptcy has come up often. At Tesla in December 2008, during the depths of the financial crisis, Musk closed a $50 million investment round from Daimler, he said, on the “last hour of last day possible or payroll would’ve bounced 2 days later.”
He has said the same about SpaceX, once noting that both SpaceX and Tesla had a more than 90% chance that they “would be worth $0” in their early days.
For 2017, Musk said, SpaceX had to perform rocket launches once every two weeks or face bankruptcy, recalled one former SpaceX executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. At a company that was driven by a goal to make life “multiplanetary,” the threat of bankruptcy was a motivating factor, the former executive said.
SpaceX has since successfully sent many rockets into space and safely landed them again on Earth. But Musk has returned to his favorite stick, tweeting last year that if a “severe global recession” were to dry up capital, bankruptcy at the rocket maker was “not impossible.”
“Only the paranoid survive,” he wrote, quoting Andy Grove, the former CEO of Intel.
A crisis atmosphere and self-imposed austerity gives Musk the cover to make drastic changes and fire top managers or eliminate large swathes of staff, two former Tesla executives said. It also prepares those who remain to work under extreme conditions to bring about Musk’s desires, they said.
The approach at Twitter, where Musk has laid off thousands of employees, “is typical Elon,” Deak said.

The chaos at the social media company is familiar to people who worked at Tesla when the company was struggling to ramp up manufacturing of the Model 3, which went on sale in 2017. In May of that year, Musk sent an email to the staff that echoed some of the language he has used with Twitter employees.
“Tesla has to be hardcore and demanding,” he wrote. “The passing grade at Tesla is excellence, because it has to be.”
In the year that followed, Musk famously slept on the floor in a Tesla factory’s conference rooms, fired the vice president of engineering and worked 120-hour weeks to cope with a lag in the production of Model 3s. Members of Tesla’s board worried about Musk’s workload and his use of Ambien to try to sleep.
Foreshadowing the turmoil at Twitter, Musk spent part of 2018 on the social media service, antagonizing lawmakers and regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC later sued Musk for tweeting that he had the “funding secured” to take Tesla private, even though the billionaire never followed through and settled with the agency. This summer, he spent months and millions of dollars in legal fees to back out of his deal to buy Twitter.
Testifying in Delaware last week in a lawsuit about his Tesla pay package, Musk acknowledged that his penchant for acting unilaterally can get him in trouble. “When I make decisions without consulting people,” he said, “the probability that those decisions will be wrong is higher.”
In Delaware, Musk also downplayed comparisons between what he was doing at Twitter with the Model 3 ramp-up, saying on his way into the courtroom that what was happening at the social media service was “easier.”

Some of Musk’s former employees question whether his management tactics will ultimately work at Twitter. Tesla and SpaceX were in earlier stages of growth when their boss whipped out his tough language and told everyone they had to go full tilt. But Twitter is a more mature company that has performed inconsistently for years.
Musk’s management techniques are “good startup and growth strategy, but it is not good for building a stable company,” Deak said.
Musk’s all-in commitment to a company is often inspirational, but can also turn toxic and engender a culture of fear and scapegoating, three former Tesla and SpaceX managers said.
And for Musk, remaking Twitter is only a part-time job. He remains CEO of Tesla, which he said in court he continued to lead, and SpaceX, where, he said, he focuses on designing rockets rather than management.
Musk also leads Boring Co., a tunneling startup, and Neuralink, a brain-computer interface technology firm. He has said his long-term goal is to save humanity by developing technology for space travel, or, in his words, by “making life multiplanetary in order to ensure the long-term survival of consciousness.”
The multitasking has become an issue in a lawsuit filed by Tesla shareholders who objected to the pay package that made Musk the world’s richest person. Last week in Delaware, under questioning by a lawyer representing shareholders who have accused Musk of neglecting his duties at Tesla, the billionaire said his intense involvement in Twitter was temporary.
“There was an initial burst of activity to reorganize the company,” he said Wednesday, adding, “I expect to reduce my time at Twitter.”

463,21-Nov-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk, Bernie Sanders and Others Miss the Mark Over Pricey Insulin; Big Pharma has taken much of the heat for sky-high insulin prices, but scrutiny could soon shift to other companies grabbing a growing slice of spending",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2738104197/BFD812D457A14912PQ/523?accountid=13946,"A tweet from a fake Eli Lilly account earlier this month claiming insulin would be free was quickly corrected by the real company, but it was enough to spark the usual finger-wagging.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has raised his hand to take over as chair of the Senate committee overseeing healthcare, argued that prices have increased so dramatically because three drug companies control the market.
Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO who has his hands full trying to turn around Twitter, defended Eli Lilly , blaming higher prices on product advances . Left out of the debate are some poorly understood middlemen: Pharmacy-benefit managers, or PBMs, have captured a growing slice of America's world-leading drug spending during the past decade. The spotlight could soon shift to them.
More than 30 million Americans, or about 10% of the country, have diabetes, and more than seven million of them require daily insulin . The high cost, studies show , has forced more than one million Americans to ration their insulin—a dangerous action that could backfire not only on a diabetic's health but on those who pay for their future care.
While the three largest manufacturers of insulin—Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi—charge more for their products in the U.S. than they do elsewhere, their take of overall spending has been decreasing in recent years as the relative power of middlemen has grown. PBMs have steadily gained negotiating clout by consolidating and merging with large insurance companies. The three largest PBMs are owned by CVS Health Corp. (which owns insurer Aetna), UnitedHealth Group Inc. and Cigna Corp.
That isn't to say that pharma companies aren't making much more than they did, say, 10 or 20 years ago, by raising the price of insulin while fending off generic competition through incremental patent protection . But the point Mr. Sanders and other critics miss is that increases in recent years have mostly been passed on to PBMs in the form of heavy discounts that are hidden from public view.
A recent study by University of Southern California scholars showed that, between 2014 and 2018, the share of a hypothetical $100 insulin expenditure accruing to manufacturers decreased by 33%. During that same period, total U.S. spending on insulin hasn't budged, but the share of insulin expenditures retained by PBMs has increased by 155%.
That shift in who benefits from recent price increases is reflected in pharma companies' financial statements. Eli Lilly, for instance, collected $4.57 billion in 2021 for its three insulin products—Humalog, Humulin and Basaglar—a drop from its $5 billion of revenue in 2020. For the first nine months of 2022, the company has collected $2.86 billion in revenue from those products.
""What's happening in this market is that the middlemen are making more and more money,"" said University of Southern California professor Neeraj Sood, one of the authors of the study who has previously done consulting work for drug companies.
Yet the drug-pricing provisions in the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act singularly focused on what manufacturers charge while ignoring other players that take a slice of profits farther down the chain. That might start to shift, representing a risk for managed-care companies like UnitedHealth, CVS and Cigna.
Targeting PBMs has increasingly become a bipartisan issue in recent years. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley has been among those leading the way in Congress. Last year, for instance, he conducted a bipartisan investigation with Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, which shed light on how rebates are pushing up the price of list prices for insulin.
And earlier this year, Mr. Grassley and Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell introduced a bill to increase drug-pricing transparency. The impact on PBMs' profits could be substantial, but the odds of such complicated legislation being enacted aren't. PBMs' much lower public profile, and the difficulty in crossing the partisan aisle these days even on smaller matters, make it unlikely there will be tough action soon.
""Betting on inaction in Washington,"" says Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, ""is always the safer way to go.""

464,21-Nov-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"How Elon Musk's Twitter Faces Mountain of Debt, Falling Revenue and Surging Costs; The social-media company is working to bring down expenses as many advertisers pause spending and debt payments loom",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2738197469/BFD812D457A14912PQ/545?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk says his $44 billion Twitter takeover might result in a bankruptcy filing . But there could be other options.
To make the deal work, Mr. Musk has been trying to add subscription revenue and reassure advertisers about the platform's future. Twitter was losing money before Mr. Musk bought the company, and the deal added a debt burden that requires fresh sources of cash.
It is tough to determine the state of the company. Twitter no longer has to file regular financial reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are crucial tools for determining a company's financial health.
Analysts and academics have been able to piece together a picture of the company from information Mr. Musk has offered as well as details of the deal and the company's last regulatory filings. Bankruptcy could be one result. Mr. Musk, the world's richest person, could also raise new funds, or buy back debt from lenders, giving Twitter a buffer to turn around its business.
Here is a look at their assessments of Twitter's financial situation and prospects.
Twitter Finances, Pre-Musk
Twitter is and was a popular tool for politicians, celebrities and journalists. But as a business, it was stagnating.
It hasn't booked an annual profit since 2019, and posted a loss in eight years of the past decade. The company's net loss narrowed in 2021, to $221.4 million from $1.14 billion the previous year.
Twitter has struggled to attract new users and increase revenue, which came in at about $5.1 billion last year . In its last quarterly filing as a public company, for the period ended June 30, revenue was $1.18 billion, down slightly year-over-year.
Nearly 90% of its revenue last year came from advertising, and it traditionally has been the company's main source of revenue. In 2021, Twitter took in $4.51 billion from advertisers, and $572 million from licensing data and other services.
The company had more than $2 billion in cash and less than $600 million in net debt before the takeover talks—very little debt for a company in the S&P 500 index. But that cash position was down 35% from a year earlier as of June 30, filings show, and Mr. Musk paid for Twitter by taking on $13 billion in debt. He paid for the rest in equity, some contributed by multiple investors.
Twitter had a market capitalization of $37.48 billion in March, the month before Mr. Musk agreed to buy it, S&P data showed. Social-media stocks have slumped sharply since then. But now, according to Jeffrey Davies, a former credit analyst and founder of data provider Enersection LLC, ""This thing's probably not worth more than what the debt stack is, quite frankly, unless you put a lot of option value just on Elon."" Mr. Musk last month said he and investors were overpaying for the company in the short term.
Revenue Under Musk
Mr. Musk said earlier this month that Twitter had suffered ""a massive drop in revenue"" and was losing $4 million a day. It isn't clear if that reflects the broader downturn in the digital ad market or the pause in advertising by several companies since Mr. Musk bought the business.
Some companies, including burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., cereal maker General Mills Inc. and airline United Airlines Holdings Inc., have paused their ad spending on Twitter over uncertainty around where the company is headed. The departure of several top executives from its ad department have soured relationships, The Wall Street Journal has reported.
The exodus of advertisers poses a threat for a company so reliant on that revenue stream. ""As an online ad company, you're flirting with disaster,"" said Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University's Stern School of Business.
Deal negotiations for long-term contracts that usually begin at the end of the year haven't taken place yet or have been put on hold. Those deals comprise more than 30% of Twitter's U.S. ad revenue, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Revenue will likely remain under pressure until advertisers fully grasp the new business model, potentially leading many of them to return to the platform, said Brent Thill, a senior analyst at Jefferies Group LLC, a financial-services firm. ""Those advertisers will come back if they feel that the users are there and there's an ability to monetize their advertisement,"" Mr. Thill said.
But that could take time. Mr. Thill said it could take months for advertisers to get clarity. ""It's an enigma,"" he said.
Market-research firm Insider Intelligence Inc. recently cut its annual ad-revenue revenue outlook for Twitter by nearly 40% through 2024.
Mr. Musk wants the company to lean more on subscriptions and depend less on digital advertising. He said last Tuesday that the company's upgraded subscription service , costing $7.99 a month, would launch Nov. 29.
Reducing Costs
The company has moved quickly to slash costs, including cutting its staff by half. Salaries and other compensation make up a large chunk of overall expenses. The company had 7,500 full-time employees at the end of 2021, up from 5,500 a year earlier, filings show.
The layoffs of roughly 3,700 people could save the company roughly $860 million a year, if the employees that are leaving made an average of about $233,000 annually—the company's most recently disclosed median pay figure. The estimated savings would represent about 15% of Twitter's $5.57 billion in costs and expenses last year. Its costs and expenses climbed 51% from the previous year, as hiring drove up its payroll.
More employees left the company last week, rejecting Mr. Musk's demand that they commit to working ""long hours at high intensity"" to stay.
Debt Mountain
Before Mr. Musk's acquisition, net debt totaled $596.5 million as of June 30, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, a data provider. That compares with a negative balance of $2.18 billion the prior-year period, indicating a cash surplus.
Twitter paid $23.3 million in interest expense in the quarter ended June 30, according to a filing.
Now, the company will have to pay at least $9 billion in interest to banks and hedge funds over the next seven to eight years, when the $13 billion in debt matures, according to a review of Twitter's loans by Mr. Davies, the former credit analyst.
The interest payments are substantial for a company that reported $6.3 billion in total operating cash flow over the past eight years, he said.
What's more, the company's debt stack now includes floating-rate debt, meaning that interest costs are set to rise as the Federal Reserve continues to increase interest rates. Twitter's debt was entirely fixed rate before the deal.
Twitter's credit ratings, which were below investment grade before the transaction with Mr. Musk, have deteriorated further. Moody's Investors Service on Oct. 31 downgraded Twitter's rating to B1 from Ba2, a two-notch drop, and S&P Global Ratings on Nov. 1 downgraded it to B- from BB+, a five-notch drop.
Financial Prospects
Twitter's financial challenges could result in the company filing for bankruptcy, raising equity or buying back some debt from its lenders, analysts and academics said.
If Twitter files for bankruptcy, as Mr. Musk warned was possible in an all-hands meeting earlier this month, his $27 billion investment would likely be wiped out because equity holders are the last to be paid when a company restructures .
Buying back debt from lenders at a steep discount would help the company reduce its debt load and interest costs as well as its valuation, which would be beneficial in the long run, Mr. Davies said.
""I don't think they can issue any more debt,"" Mr. Davies said. ""It's a really, really tough structure.""
The company could also replace some of the debt with equity, both from Mr. Musk and from outside investors, said David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland's Robert H. Smith School of Business. For that, Mr. Musk would need to persuade potential investors that he has a viable long-term business plan, he said. Replacing debt could enable the company to generate cash. Mr. Musk has said some of his latest Tesla Inc. stock sale, yielding almost $4 billion in cash, was because of Twitter.
If successful, the company could generate positive free cash flow in two or three years, which it could use to pay down the residual debt and eventually go public again, Mr. Kass said. ""The prospect of an eventual IPO within three to five years would be a very attractive enticement for large funds,"" he said.

 How Elon Musk's Twitter Faces Mountain of Debt, Falling Revenue and Surging Costs

465,22-Nov-22,Barron's (Online),"Tesla Stock Has Cost Musk $200 Billion. Here's Who, and What, to Blame.",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2738426207/BFD812D457A14912PQ/44?accountid=13946,"The drop in Tesla stock has cost investors and CEO Elon Musk a huge amount of money. As the end of the year approaches, investors—and maybe even Musk—should consider how it happened.
On Monday, Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock closed at $167.87, down 6.8%, at the lowest close since Nov. 20, 2020, when shares closed at $163.20, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Shares are off 58% from their 52-week high of $402.67, set back in January.
At the yearly high, Musk's Tesla stake was worth more than $323 billion, including his management stock options . Back then, Musk held more than 500 million shares and another 300 million stock options that he will get control of as different business milestones are met.
Now his Tesla stake is worth about $119 billion. That is a $204 billion drop, but don't forget that Musk has sold about $19 billion worth of Tesla shares this year. He put that money into Twitter. Considering the sales, and adjusting for Musk's losses when he overpaid for Twitter, he is down roughly $200 billion.
There are four things to blame.
Investors might be inclined to blame the Tesla CEO—or Musk plus car-industry factors such as increased competition in the market for electric vehicles—for the decline in Tesla stock. But the main reason for the share-price slide comes from the broader market.
While Tesla stock is down 58%, the Nasdaq Composite Index is off about 30% over the same span. Tesla shares tend to be more volatile than the overall index, rising and falling faster when tech stocks are going up or down. In a year when the index is down 30%, investors should expect a stock like Tesla to drop about 43% based on its historic correlation with the market.
That means roughly 75% of the drop in Tesla stock, and Musk's Tesla wealth, is due to nothing more than the overall movement of the market.
Then there is the industry to consider. Most car stocks have been hit harder than the broader market. Cars are a discretionary purchase and falling demand sends investors fleeing the sector. Rising interest rates are raising the cost of large, financed purchases—like cars—more than for other items.
Shares of Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) are down about 40% over the span in which Tesla stock has lost 58%. There isn't really a reliable correlation between GM, Ford and Tesla stocks, but it shows Musk's company isn't alone.
Then there are those rates. Higher interest rates reduce the current, discounted value of earnings that are expected to roll in over coming years. That hits the valuations of richly valued growth stocks more than others because more of their earnings are expected to arrive far in the future.
Exactly how much of Musk's wealth has been eaten away by higher interest rates is hard to say. Short-term and long-term rates don't move in lockstep and investors never assume that rates a few years from now will be the same as they are today.
Figuring out how much of the loss to blame on Musk himself is also more art than science, but it is easier than weighing the former two contributing factors. Tesla stock is down $57 since he took over Twitter . That decline—roughly 15% of the drop from $402.67—is the loss investors can blame on their CEO.
With 75% being the market and 15% on Musk, investors can give industry-related problems and interest rates 5% each.
That sheds a little light on how the stock might make a comeback. An end to concerns about how Musk's purchase of Twitter might boost the stock by $50 or so. A gain of another $40 could come when interest rates stop going up.
But as is the case with most stocks, the best thing for Tesla investors would be for all investors to feel more confident about the future. That would send the entire market, including Tesla stock, higher.

Elon Musk has a lost $101 billion in 2022 so far as Tesla share price plunged amid a rough broader stock market and a self-induced Tesla selloff to fund his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter.
Musk’s net worth has dropped from $271 billion at the end of 2021 to $170 billion as of today (Nov. 22), according Bloomberg Billionaires List. He is still the world’s wealthiest person, but his fortune has halved from its peak of $340 billion just a year ago.
About a third of Musk’s fortune is tied to Tesla. The electric carmaker’s share price is down nearly 58 percent this year, twice the 29 percent decline in the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, as the company struggles to meet its lofty revenue growth targets.
Musk also owns a significant stake in SpaceX, a private rocket and satellite manufacturer most recently valued at $125 billion in a June fundraising round. Musk’s SpaceX share is valued at $47 billion. In addition, he has about $26 billion worth of assets tied up in Twitter, the Boring Company and cash."

Talking of bankruptcy. Telling workers to be ""hard core."" Mr. Musk has repeatedly used those tactics at many of his companies.Elon Musk was sleeping at the office. He dismissed employees and executives at will. And he lamented his company was on the verge of bankruptcy.That was back in 2018 and the company was Tesla, as Mr. Musk's electric automaker struggled to build its mass-market vehicle, the Model 3.""It was excruciating,"" he told The New York Times at the time. ""There were times when I didn't leave the factory for three or four days -- days when I didn't go outside.""The billionaire's experience with what he called Tesla's ""production hell"" has become a blueprint for the crisis he has created at Twitter, which he bought for $44 billion last month. Over the years, Mr. Musk has developed a playbook for managing his companies -- including Tesla and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX -- through periods of pain, employing shock treatment and alarmism and pushing his workers and himself to put aside their families and friends to spend all their energy on his mission.At Twitter, Mr. Musk has used many of those same tactics to upend the social media company in just a few weeks.Since late last month, the 51-year-old has laid off 50 percent of Twitter's 7,500 employees and accepted the resignations of 1,200 or more. On Monday, he began another round of layoffs, two people said. He tweeted that he was sleeping at Twitter's offices in San Francisco. And he has applied mission-driven language, telling Twitter's workers that the company could go bankrupt if he wasn't able to turn it around. Those who want to work on ""Twitter 2.0"" must commit to his ""hard core"" vision in writing, he has said.David Deak, who worked at Tesla from 2014 to 2016 as a senior engineering manager overseeing a supply chain for battery materials, said Mr. Musk ""clearly thrives in existential circumstances."" He added, ""He quasi creates them to light the fire under everybody.""The similarities between Mr. Musk's approach to Twitter and what he did at Tesla and SpaceX are evident, added Tammy Madsen, a management professor at Santa Clara University. But it's unclear if he will find the means to motivate employees at a social media company as he did with workers whose quests were to move people away from gas-powered cars or send humans into space.""At Tesla and SpaceX, the approach has always been high risk, high reward,"" Dr. Madsen said. ""Twitter has been high risk, but the question is: What is the reward that comes out of it?""Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.On Sunday, Mr. Musk held a meeting with Twitter's sales employees, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. Then on Monday, he laid off employees in the sales department, they said. Late last week, Mr. Musk fired Robin Wheeler, a top sales executive, they added. Bloomberg earlier reported that more layoffs might be coming.Twitter is also reaching out to some engineers who quit to ask them to return, the people said. In a meeting with employees on Monday, Mr. Musk said the company was not planning any further layoffs, according to one person who attended.At companies led by Mr. Musk, the pattern of claiming that the firms are on the brink of a potential bankruptcy has come up often. At Tesla in December 2008, during the depths of the financial crisis, Mr. Musk closed a $50 million investment round from Daimler, he said, on the ""last hour of last day possible or payroll would've bounced 2 days later.""He has said the same about SpaceX, once noting that both SpaceX and Tesla had a more than 90 percent chance that they ""would be worth $0"" in their early days.For 2017, Mr. Musk said, SpaceX had to perform rocket launches once every two weeks or face bankruptcy, recalled one former SpaceX executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. At a company that was driven by a goal to make life ""multiplanetary,"" the threat of bankruptcy was a motivating factor, the former executive said.SpaceX has since successfully sent many rockets into space and safely landed them again on Earth. But Mr. Musk has returned to his favorite stick, tweeting last year that if a ""severe global recession"" were to dry up capital, bankruptcy at the rocket maker was ""not impossible.""""Only the paranoid survive,"" he wrote, quoting Andy Grove, the former chief executive of Intel.A crisis atmosphere and self-imposed austerity gives Mr. Musk the cover to make drastic changes and fire top managers or eliminate large swaths of staff, two former Tesla executives said. It also prepares those who remain to work under extreme conditions to bring about Mr. Musk's desires, they said.The approach at Twitter, where Mr. Musk has laid off thousands of employees, ""is typical Elon,"" Mr. Deak said.The chaos at the social media company is familiar to people who worked at Tesla when the company was struggling to ramp up manufacturing of the Model 3, which went on sale in 2017. In May of that year, Mr. Musk sent an email to the staff that echoed some of the language he has used with Twitter employees.""Tesla has to be hardcore and demanding,"" he wrote. ""The passing grade at Tesla is excellence, because it has to be.""In the year that followed, Mr. Musk famously slept on the floor in a Tesla factory's conference rooms, fired the vice president of engineering and worked 120-hour weeks to cope with a lag in the production of Model 3s. Members of Tesla's board worried about Mr. Musk's workload and his use of Ambien to try to sleep.Foreshadowing the turmoil at Twitter, Mr. Musk spent part of 2018 on the social media service, antagonizing lawmakers and regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission.

468,22-Nov-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Is Elon Musk Your Boss's Anger Translator? Many leaders who think the working world has gone soft in recent years envy the new Twitter chief's unfiltered style and push for maximum effort from employees,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2738337358/BFD812D457A14912PQ/520?accountid=13946,"Your boss probably hasn't demanded a loyalty pledge and almost certainly doesn't own a rocket ship, but the person calling the shots at your company might be more like Elon Musk than you realize.
On the inside, anyway.
The Tesla and SpaceX chief is defying norms in his takeover of Twitter by skipping a newcomer's traditional review period, swiftly removing top leaders and laying off roughly half of the staff . He has made sudden strategic changes and reversed some just as quickly, contributing to a chaotic public image that few executives would want to model.
What is consistent—and alluring to some bosses—is the billionaire's unapologetically high standard for employees. He spelled it out last week in an emailed ultimatum , saying that Twitter employees must commit to ""long hours at high intensity"" or leave with three months' severance. He also has fired internal critics and vowed to curb remote work, contending a leaner, harder-working team is necessary for Twitter to improve its financial position and compete in a crowded social-media market.
Managers who think the working world has gone soft in recent years, with all the talk of flexibility and work-life balance, say they envy Mr. Musk's unfiltered style and share his craving for maximum effort—even if they wouldn't act quite as forcefully as the world's richest person .
""I think every successful CEO, including myself, is tired of all the whining,"" says Michael Friedman, chief executive of the New York investment firm First Level Capital.
To these frustrated executives, Mr. Musk is what the comedian Keegan-Michael Key was to former President Barack Obama: the anger translator . He delivers the unvarnished version of what the person in charge is truly thinking and feeling but can't say out loud.
Mr. Friedman, 57 years old, says his professional ethos was forged in an office where, as a young stockbroker, he didn't earn an assigned desk until he landed his first 100 accounts. He chafes at the contemporary rebellion against hustle culture, exemplified by the "" quiet quitting "" phenomenon in which workers keep their jobs but do only the bare minimum.
Would he take as hard a line as Mr. Musk?
""Well, I certainly don't have as many zeros behind my name as he does,"" Mr. Friedman says.
Mr. Musk's fortune and company-building record could afford him uncommon power to push employees hard. A decade ago at Tesla, for instance, he pressed his team to the brink of exhaustion : ""Prepare yourself for a level of intensity that is greater than anything most of you have experienced before,"" he warned in an email at the time. The company ultimately flourished.
That isn't to say there won't be fallout at Twitter. Hundreds of employees quit in recent days , and even those who signed his pledge to be ""extremely hardcore"" may be hunting for jobs elsewhere. ""Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade,"" he told employees. Meanwhile, many advertisers have halted or reduced spending at Twitter, and Mr. Musk has said bankruptcy isn't out of the question. He paid $44 billion for Twitter, which has posted a loss in eight of the past 10 fiscal years.
Yet he is the rare CEO with a fan base—""Musketeers,"" as this male-dominated bunch is known—and might be able to fill the company's ranks with devotees who believe in his vision of a more freewheeling and profitable platform and are willing to grind.
That appears to be his bet. And if he fails, he will likely remain fabulously wealthy from other ventures. It is a position that most other business leaders can only wish for.
""He can do whatever he wants, and everyone that has an opinion about it can piss off,"" says Derek Grubbs, director of sales development at Crux Informatics, a software company. ""If everybody exits from Twitter, there are plenty of other people who will be ready to enter because it pays well, and working for Elon Musk has a flair to it.""
 The median salary at Twitter last year was more than $230,000, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. It is unclear whether the company will offer additional money to recruit and retain workers in a harder-charging environment. Twitter didn't respond to an inquiry.
Mr. Grubbs, a 36-year-old Navy veteran, says he shares Mr. Musk's strong preference for in-person work but recognizes that it is a tough sell. Charged with hiring a small team after joining Crux in April, he says he lets employees work from home sometimes but requires them to live in Austin, Texas, so that the group can meet regularly in an office.
Jon Arnold, chief executive of J. Arnold Wealth Management in Youngstown, Ohio, says he gave up on hybrid work in June and ordered his 27 employees to report daily to the office, having concluded that people were less productive at home.
He estimates that a typical employee needs to put in 50 to 55 hours a week to hit the goals he sets for them but says that he offers higher salaries than nearby firms and works 65 to 70 hours a week to set an example.
""I run my business very much like Elon Musk,"" says Mr. Arnold, 46. ""I'm a right-way-is-the-only-way kind of guy.""
He adds that he has fired receptionists for failing to greet clients with a ""good morning"" and a cup of coffee.
Still, he says he was forced to acknowledge several years ago that his intensity was driving too many talented hires to quit within three months. Instead of issuing ultimatums, Mr. Arnold says he kept the bar high while softening his demeanor and taking more interest in employees' personal lives—making sure they could get home in time for children's concerts and soccer games, for instance.
Alas, most bosses who admire Mr. Musk can't get away with being as tough as the man himself. They will have to settle for living vicariously through his ""hardcore"" declarations.

469,23-Nov-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Tesla Board's Ties to Musk Vex Experts: [Business/Financial Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2738776781/BFD812D457A14912PQ/17?accountid=13946,"Corporate governance experts say the electric-car maker's directors may need to rein in the chief executive, with whom many have personal ties.Since Elon Musk took over Twitter last month, his stewardship of the social network has been marked by turmoil, intrigue and no shortage of questions. Here's one: How much time is he spending on his job as chief executive of Tesla, the electric-car maker?Robyn Denholm, Tesla's chairwoman, testified in court last week that although she did not know the answer, she was not perturbed. ""The quantum of time isn't a measure that concerns me,"" she said. ""It's more the results that he's able to drive.""But as Mr. Musk has become consumed with Twitter, Tesla is facing a range of threats to its business, and its stock price has been plunging. Some corporate governance experts say Tesla's board needs to ensure that the company has a chief who is not distracted.""They're violating their fiduciary responsibility if they don't address that issue head-on,"" said William Klepper, a professor of management at Columbia Business School.Tesla's board has long been criticized by shareholder groups for lacking independence from Mr. Musk. When Tesla's stock price was soaring and the company appeared to have the electric-car market mostly to itself, that argument found little resonance.Now Tesla is facing much fiercer competition, especially in China, a huge market for the company, and it is still contending with supply chain problems and scrutiny of safety issues with its driver-assistance systems. Its stock has plummeted nearly 60 percent from its peak a year ago; since Mr. Musk bought Twitter last month, the S&P 500 stock index has risen 5 percent, but Tesla shares are down 25 percent. Mr. Musk has sold roughly $30 billion of Tesla stock this year and last, in part to help finance his Twitter acquisition.""I would expect that a good board would be doing everything it can to ensure that a C.E.O. was sufficiently focused on their company,"" said Brianna Castro, senior director of U.S. research at Glass Lewis, a shareholder advisory firm. ""And in situations similar to Tesla's, a good board would be concerned why their stock is down when the market is up, and doing what they can to address any issues.""Some corporate governance experts are concerned that the board members' views may be clouded by their personal relationships with Mr. Musk. Mr. Musk's brother, Kimbal, is a member, and other directors, like James Murdoch, a media executive and a son of Rupert Murdoch, are longtime friends of Mr. Musk. Some Tesla board members have financial ties to Mr. Musk's other businesses, like SpaceX, the rocket company.Another factor: Tesla's directors receive compensation, almost entirely in stock, that is many times larger than what directors get at other large companies, enabling some of them to amass fortunes over the years.""If the pay is so compelling that the director is going to be motivated to do whatever is reasonably possible to keep that gravy train rolling,"" said Marc Goldstein, head of U.S. research at ISS Governance, a shareholder advisory group, ""that will interfere with the director exercising independent oversight over the management team."" ISS has recommended voting against re-electing certain Tesla directors.Mr. Musk and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.Ms. Denholm's testimony in the Delaware Court of Chancery last week arose over a pay deal Mr. Musk received in 2018 that ended up awarding him tens of billions of dollars Tesla stock. A shareholder filed a lawsuit asserting that the payout was excessive and that the board did not act with sufficient independence when approving it.Mr. Musk was both chief executive and chairman of Tesla until he was required to step down as chairman as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2018 to resolve securities fraud charges.Ms. Denholm, a former telecom executive who assumed the chair, has made huge sums as a director. Her compensation, composed almost entirely of stock options, was $5.8 million in 2020, well in excess of the average pay for a director at a large public company.A study by Steven Hall, a compensation consultant, showed that director pay was on average just over $300,000 at large companies in 2020. At the higher end, John L. Hennessy, the chairman of Alphabet, Google's parent, had compensation of $620,000 last year.And Tesla securities filings show that since 2014, the company awarded Ms. Denholm compensation, paid almost completely in Tesla stock options, that the company valued at more than $30 million. As Tesla's stock rose in value, she was able to sell her shares for significant gains. Since 2020, she has sold Tesla stock worth $280 million, according to securities filings. Ms. Denholm did not respond to requests for comment.In the trial over the shareholder suit, lawyers for the plaintiff, who wants Mr. Musk's 2018 pay deal to be voided, sought to show that Tesla's board was more like a private club than a committee of seasoned professionals dedicated to looking out for shareholders. Tesla directors detailed their personal connections to Mr. Musk and sometimes with one another.Some of them pointed to the sharp rise in the company's stock price since 2019 as proof that Mr. Musk had done a tremendous job and was invaluable to the automaker.Ira Ehrenpreis, an investor who heads Tesla's compensation committee, has been close to Mr. Musk for years. According to court documents, he helped Mr. Musk design the 2018 pay deal, which, after Mr. Musk fulfilled 11 of 12 performance goals, paid out stock worth about $40 billion at Tesla's current share price.In 2018, Tesla paid Mr. Ehrenpreis nearly $10 million, almost all in stock options, to cover three years, for his board duties. He did not respond to requests for comment.Antonio Gracias, an investor who was on Tesla's board until last year, acknowledged in court that he had known Mr. Musk for more than 20 years and that the two had endured ""a lot of tough times"" together, bringing them closer. He acknowledged he and Mr. Musk had vacationed together, been to each other's homes, shared meals and discussed their children. Mr. Gracias also acknowledged that he had attended Mr. Musk's second wedding and Kimbal Musk's wedding, and that he was friendly with Mr. Musk's mother and sister. Mr. Gracias acknowledged he had been on ski trips with Mr. Musk and described James Murdoch as ""a great skier.""Mr. Gracias said he was able to maintain his independence while vacationing with Mr. Musk because of their ""trusting and respecting relationship."" Mr. Gracias did not respond to requests for comment for this article.In court, Mr. Murdoch said he met Elon Musk in the late 1990s when Mr. Musk was working on a digital advertising business. The two reconnected after Mr. Murdoch, then living in Britain, purchased one of the first Tesla vehicles sold in Europe and Mr. Musk reached out to thank him. Mr. Murdoch said he had been to Jerusalem and Mexico with Mr. Musk and his family. He also acknowledged that he had attended Kimbal Musk's wedding, dined with Kimbal Musk and his wife and personally invested in SpaceX. Mr. Murdoch also said he had purchased shares of Tesla before joining its board.Since joining the board in 2017, Mr. Murdoch has received $11 million, mostly in stock options, for being a Tesla director and has a stake in the company worth more than $200 million, according to estimates based on Tesla's securities disclosures. Mr. Murdoch did not respond to requests for comment on his Tesla holdings and whether the board was doing enough to ensure that Mr. Musk was not distracted.Mr. Murdoch testified in the Delaware court that a board committee was monitoring the situation at Twitter, adding that Mr. Musk had in recent months identified a potential successor at Tesla but did not say who it was.In court last week, Mr. Musk sought to make light of inferences that Tesla's board was an elite club of friends. When asked about his vacations with Mr. Murdoch, he said his time off was centered less on leisure and more on getting work done, describing it as ""email with a view.""PhotographThe compensation of Robyn Denholm, Tesla's chairwoman, was $5.8 million in 2020, almost entirely in stock options.

470,23-Nov-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition","On the Clock: The Bosses Who Want To Emulate Elon Musk --- Many managers envy his style, push employees for maximum effort",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2738862974/BFD812D457A14912PQ/513?accountid=13946,"Your boss probably hasn't demanded a loyalty pledge and almost certainly doesn't own a rocket ship, but the person calling the shots at your company might be more like Elon Musk than you realize.
On the inside, anyway.
The Tesla and SpaceX chief is defying norms in his takeover of Twitter by skipping a newcomer's traditional review period, swiftly removing top leaders and laying off roughly half of the staff. He has made sudden strategic changes and reversed some just as quickly, contributing to a chaotic public image that few executives would want to model.
What is consistent -- and alluring to some bosses -- is the billionaire's unapologetically high standard for employees. He spelled it out last week in an emailed ultimatum, saying that Twitter employees must commit to ""long hours at high intensity"" or leave with three months' severance. He also has fired internal critics and vowed to curb remote work, contending a leaner, harder-working team is necessary for Twitter to improve its financial position and compete in a crowded social-media market.
Managers who think the working world has gone soft in recent years, with all the talk of flexibility and work-life balance, say they envy Mr. Musk's unfiltered style and share his craving for maximum effort -- even if they wouldn't act quite as forcefully as the world's richest person.
""I think every successful CEO, including myself, is tired of all the whining,"" says Michael Friedman, chief executive of the New York investment firm First Level Capital.
Mr. Friedman, 57 years old, says his professional ethos was forged in an office where, as a young stockbroker, he didn't earn an assigned desk until he landed his first 100 accounts.
He chafes at the contemporary rebellion against hustle culture, exemplified by the ""quiet quitting"" phenomenon in which workers keep their jobs but do only the bare minimum.
Would he take as hard a line as Mr. Musk?
""Well, I certainly don't have as many zeros behind my name as he does,"" Mr. Friedman says.
Mr. Musk's fortune and company-building record could afford him uncommon power to push employees hard. A decade ago at Tesla, for instance, he pressed his team to the brink of exhaustion: ""Prepare yourself for a level of intensity that is greater than anything most of you have experienced before,"" he warned in an email at the time. The company ultimately flourished.
That isn't to say there won't be fallout at Twitter. Hundreds of employees quit in recent days, and even those who signed his pledge to be ""extremely hardcore"" may be hunting for jobs elsewhere. ""Only exceptional performance will constitute a passing grade,"" he told employees. Meanwhile, many advertisers have halted or reduced spending at Twitter, and Mr. Musk has said bankruptcy isn't out of the question. He paid $44 billion for Twitter, which has posted a loss in eight of the past 10 fiscal years.
Yet he is the rare CEO with a fan base -- ""Musketeers,"" as this male-dominated bunch is known -- and might be able to fill the company's ranks with devotees who believe in his vision of a more freewheeling and profitable platform and are willing to grind.
That appears to be his bet. And if he fails, he will likely remain fabulously wealthy from other ventures. It is a position that most other business leaders can only wish for.

471,23-Nov-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk's Twitter Takeover Triggers Partisan Clash on Government's Role; Democrats say company staff cutbacks threaten user security, while Republicans maintain that the dispute is over free speech",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2739029778/BFD812D457A14912PQ/628?accountid=13946,"WASHINGTON—Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter Inc. is fueling a partisan clash in Washington, as Democrats raise concerns about the platform's security and Republicans counter that the criticism is a thinly veiled attempt to stamp out conservative voices on the site.
Democrats including President Biden have pointed to Mr. Musk's ownership of Twitter, most recently citing staff cutbacks that some Democrats say could potentially compromise the platform's ability to secure the personal data of its users.
Republicans including Kevin McCarthy of California, the likely incoming House speaker next year, said Democrats are going after Mr. Musk because of his willingness to give conservatives a voice on the platform. Mr. Musk recently reinstated the Twitter account of former President Donald Trump.
""Elon's pursuit of free speech is a direct threat to the Democrat Party and their allies in legacy media,"" Mr. McCarthy, the House minority leader, said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal. ""While the Democrats attack any effort to give individual Americans a stronger voice, Republicans will be vigilant against the collusion between Big Tech and this administration aimed at shutting down free speech.""
The clash could foreshadow greater polarization over the internet and the government's role in regulating it. In recent years, calls have mounted for Congress to improve privacy protections, to blunt the market dominance of giant technology companies and to update the law that shields large internet companies from liability for third-party content.
Democrats and Republicans have often worked closely on some of these proposals, but fissures have been building for years.
Some Democrats assert that Mr. Trump's 2016 election was aided by improper foreign interference online, notably through the spreading of fake news on Facebook.
 Photos: How Musk Made His Fortune 
For their part, Republicans have long raised concerns that many social-media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, whose parent is Meta Platforms Inc., and Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube, have unfairly suppressed conservative viewpoints, which the companies generally have denied.
Some conservatives were further upset by the banning of Mr. Trump from Twitter and other social-media platforms after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his followers. That helped lead to a proliferation of new conservative-leaning social-media platforms, including Mr. Trump's Truth Social.
More recently, Republicans have focused on what they view as collusion between Democrats and social-media platforms over such issues as Covid-19 information.
In the latest development, the GOP state attorneys general of Louisiana and Missouri said Tuesday that they plan to depose Dr. Anthony Fauci, Mr. Biden's chief medical adviser and the government's top infectious-disease official, in connection with their civil lawsuit alleging that the Biden administration colluded with social-media companies to censor comments on Covid-19 and other topics.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said recently that the administration remains committed to combating disinformation that threatens security and disputed suggestions that the administration secretly colluded to censor social-media posts.
Democratic officials have criticized Mr. Musk on a range of issues. Some have cited his financial ties to China, where his Tesla Inc. car company has extensive operations, as well as minority ownership stakes in Twitter held by a Saudi prince and other Mideast figures.
""I think that Elon Musk's cooperation and/or technical relationships with other countries is worthy of being looked at,"" Mr. Biden said at a recent press conference.
Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) has called on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to investigate the Twitter deal, citing the potential influence of Saudi Arabia.
The Treasury Department oversees Cfius and doesn't comment on transactions it might be reviewing. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently told CBS News that she was unaware of any basis to launch an investigation of the Twitter deal. The Treasury Department didn't respond to a request for further comment.
The Democratic-led Federal Trade Commission said it is concerned over Twitter's ability to live up to its obligations under a $150 million settlement it reached with the company after federal attorneys alleged that it had collected phone numbers and email addresses for account-security measures—and then fed the information into its advertising tools.
In a Nov. 17 letter to FTC Chair Lina Khan, seven Democratic U.S. senators called on the agency to investigate any breach of Twitter's consent decree. The letter said Mr. Musk ""has taken alarming steps that have undermined the integrity and safety of the platform, and announced new features despite clear warnings those changes would be abused for fraud, scams, and dangerous impersonation.""
Twitter didn't respond to a request for comment.
In a statement, the FTC said that the 2022 settlement it reached with Twitter ""gives us new tools to ensure compliance, and we are prepared to use them.""
""No CEO or company is above the law, and companies must follow our consent decrees,"" the statement said.

472,24-Nov-22,USA Today (Online),Why is a giant sculpture of Elon Musk on a goat's body being driven around Texas?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2739479426/BFD812D457A14912PQ/283?accountid=13946,"AUSTIN, Texas — It can seem hard to avoid Elon Musk these days, especially if you live in Central Texas near Tesla and other companies led by the billionaire. And if that weren't enough, self-described ""massive Elon fans"" are driving a giant sculpture of Musk's face — on the body of a goat, riding on a rocket — around the Austin area. The owners of the sculpture run a cryptocurrency firm called Elon Goat Token and say it is meant to pay homage to Musk's contributions to cryptocurrency. The sculpture is intended to symbolize that Musk is the GOAT — an acronym for Greatest Of All Time — which is why the billionaire's head is on the body of a goat. It sits on the back of a semi-trailer and is more than 30 feet long, 20 feet tall, and Musk's head, which is wearing a Dogecoin necklace, is about 6 feet tall. The sculpture also includes such features as simulated rocket fire, smoke, lasers, and lighting. As a way to market and promote the cryptocurrency platform, Elon Goat Token owners hope to give Musk the statue in person. While there's no telling if Musk will accept the sculpture, owners hope to deliver it on Saturday to Tesla headquarters after a company event, ""GOATSgiving,"" a gathering for fans of Musk and cryptocurrency. Attendees are invited to join the delivery as well.  Musk has yet to acknowledge that he is aware of the statue or say whether he will be in Austin that day. Fights, tents, swarms of people: What Black Friday in America looked like at peak chaos Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade: See the 2022 floats and balloons Richard Latimer, a co-founder of Elon Goat Token, said the sculpture has led to a lot of turned heads, playing well into the marketing goal to ""just be crazy and out there."" “We dedicated the statue to (Elon Musk) because he stepped in for crypto at a good point and blew everything up. With everything he has done with (cryptocurrencies) Doge and Baby Doge and a few other coins, we decided why not do the same thing, but really go out there and go above and beyond and to bring something to him,"" Latimer said. Its creators say the monument to Musk cost $600,000 to build. The project was funded primarily through fees on cryptocurrency transactions and funding from cryptocurrency community members, the company's founders said.  What is an Elon Goat Token? Cryptocurrency is a type of digital asset that can be used to make online payments and can come in different forms, each with different values, from Bitcoin to Dogecoin, a type of meme coin that has been a favorite of Musk's. The billionaire first gave his support to bitcoin in 2021 when he bought $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin through Tesla, though the company sold off most of it early this year. Musk has since been more into Dogecoin, which is based on the Shiba Inu meme, and occasionally tweets about cryptocurrency. How did the Elon Musk sculpture come to be? Ashley Sansalone, one of the crypto firm's founders, said that the project started after he was asked to consult on an Elon NFT project, which led to the idea of building a physical monument of the Elon GOAT NFT project. After consulting a designer in California, they decided it made the most sense to put it on a trailer. With the statue movable, Sansalone said it made sense to just drive it to Musk. Construction of the sculpture started about a year ago, and before it came to Austin, it toured a number of states, including Arizona, Washington and California. Sansalone said most people who see the sculpture in person have had positive reactions, though he acknowledged that online the statue has received some negative comments from people who, he said, are ""against capitalism or Elon."" ""We started a token project around it and built a community around it. And just been a really fun, interesting journey, to say the least,"" Sansalone said. This article originally appeared on Austin American-Statesman: Why is a giant sculpture of Elon Musk on a goat's body being driven around Texas?"
473,26-Nov-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Crypto Entrepreneurs Seek Elon Musk's Attention With $600,000 Goat Statue; Co-founders of Elon GOAT token aim to deliver 12,000-pound sculpture to Tesla's Austin headquarters",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2740136766/BFD812D457A14912PQ/109?accountid=13946,"Kevin Stone got the call late last year: Could he make a statue of a giant goat with the head of Elon Musk riding a rocket. Mr. Stone, a metal sculptor in British Columbia, Canada, assumed the stranger on the phone was Mr. Musk.
""I mean, who else would want something so crazy?"" asked Mr. Stone, who typically gets hired to make metal dragons and eagles.
The request came from a couple of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs. The goal: to get Mr. Musk to tweet about the sculpture to his more than 118 million followers and draw attention to their cryptocurrency, the Elon GOAT.
""Elon tweeting us would legitimize the token,"" said Ashley Sansalone, an Elon GOAT co-founder.
It is the latest stunt in the cryptocurrency space, where jokes and memes about digital currencies regularly flood social media. But a 12,000-pound sculpture as a marketing gimmick isn't so common.
The creators of Elon GOAT say the name of their cryptocurrency was inspired by how much they respect Mr. Musk. They and his other fans think he is the ""greatest of all time,"" or a ""GOAT."" They took the admiration literally, spending $600,000 to create a sculpture of Mr. Musk's head, wearing a gold-plated dogecoin necklace on a goat's body. The rocket can move, pointing to the sky as if it is taking off. Gas lines run through it so that flames can shoot out of the back.
On Saturday, the sculpture is being driven to Tesla Inc.'s headquarters in Austin, Texas, in the hope that Mr. Musk will come out and accept it as a gift. The creators are calling the event ""GOATSgiving.""
Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. Mr. Musk hasn't acknowledged his four-legged likeness or reached out to the token's founders.
One of them, Mr. Sansalone, said he works on the token full time and previously ran a construction company and traded energy. Unlike bitcoin, ether or dogecoin, the Elon GOAT token is far from a household cryptocurrency name. It is ranked well outside the largest cryptocurrencies by market value, according to CoinMarketCap.
The idea of the sculpture came together last year. ""It was an evening joke that kind of just came to fruition,"" said Mr. Sansalone, 40 years old.
Mr. Musk's head was made by Mr. Stone, which took nearly six months to complete. The goat body and rocket were made by others in Phoenix to speed up the project, Mr. Sansalone said. Then all the pieces were put together and attached to the back of a 70-foot long semi-truck trailer.
""When I first saw the statue my jaw dropped,"" said DeMarco Hill, 51, who spotted it in September in Goodyear, Ariz., where he lives. He grabbed his 12-year-old son and they followed it. ""It was something you've never seen before in your life.""
Mr. Hill, a trucker who owns his own company, Stay Ready Trucking, thought the stunt was so entertaining that he found Mr. Sansalone and asked if he could participate. Mr. Sansalone said Mr. Hill was needed because only someone with a special license could drive around the heaping pile of metal.
He has since driven the sculpture through California, Arizona and Washington, before bringing it to Texas. People who drive by honk their horns or give a thumbs-up, Mr. Hill said.
""If I pull up to the side of the road it's like people crowding around,"" he said. ""It gets crazy.""
Denise McKinney was buying lunch last month from a taco truck on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles when she saw it drive by.
""My first thought was like, 'What the hell is this?'"" said the 43-year-old author.
Then she recognized the face. ""Ugh,"" she said she thought to herself, ""of course it has Elon Musk on it.""
Mr. Sansalone said the sculpture has mostly gotten a positive response. He hasn't heard anyone mistaken Mr. Musk's face for someone else. ""I would say he is probably the most relevant person on the planet right now,"" Mr. Sansalone said about Mr. Musk, the world's richest person who recently bought Twitter Inc. for $44 billion .
In September, the sculpture sat in front of Tesla's office in Palo Alto, Calif., during the company's artificial-intelligence conference. Tesla employees crossed the street to take pictures with the sculpture, Mr. Sansalone said. Mr. Musk was at the conference, according to Twitter posts he made, and Mr. Sansalone assumes the billionaire saw the sculpture.
""All there was to look at was a lit-up rocket erected in the middle of the street,"" he said.
For the past month, Elon GOAT has been promoting the Saturday event and tweeting at Mr. Musk, hoping it will give him enough time to get to Austin, Mr. Sansalone said. They were encouraged when a flight-tracking service showed Mr. Musk's jet heading to Austin on Wednesday.
They plan to deliver the sculpture to Tesla's headquarters on Saturday afternoon. The hope is that Mr. Musk will come out and accept it.
If Mr. Musk doesn't, Mr. Sansalone said he has only one plan.
""Go home and cry,"" he said.

It is the latest stunt in the cryptocurrency space, where jokes and memes about digital currencies regularly flood social media. But a 6-ton sculpture as a marketing gimmick isn't so common.

They trucked it to Tesla Inc.'s headquarters, in hopes Mr. Musk would accept the gift. The creators are calling called the event ""GOATSgiving.""
But about two hours after the co-founders of Elon GOAT parked the sculpture right outside the Tesla building, there was no sign of Mr. Musk.
Dustin Dailey, a security officer at Tesla, walked over to a group of about 15 people and said they couldn't accept the sculpture on Mr. Musk's behalf, but would find a spot for it on their property if Mr. Musk gave the thumbs-up.
But so far Mr. Musk hasn't given any indication he would accept it or whether he knew the sculpture was there. Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment
""I am fairly certain he does know about it,"" said Mr. Dailey of the sculpture. ""It's all over Twitter.""
Alec Wolvert, an Elon GOAT co-founder and chief marketing officer, said they were planning on camping out on a piece of public land off a toll road that overlooks the headquarters until Mr. Musk accepted the sculpture.
""We're gonna stay here as long as possible,"" Mr. Wolvert said. ""I even heard some people say they were going to strap themselves to it.""
The idea of the sculpture came together last year. ""It was an evening joke that kind of just came to fruition,"" said Ashley Sansalone, an Elon GOAT co-founder.
The cryptocurrency entrepreneurs asked Kevin Stone, a metal sculptor in British Columbia, Canada, to make the giant sculpture with Mr. Musk's head. The goal: to get Mr. Musk to tweet about the sculpture to his more than 118 million followers and draw attention to their cryptocurrency, the Elon GOAT.
""Elon tweeting us would legitimize the token,"" said Mr. Sansalone, 40 years old.
Mr. Sansalone said he works on the token full time and previously ran a construction company and traded energy. Unlike bitcoin, ether or dogecoin, the Elon GOAT token is far from a household cryptocurrency name. It is ranked well outside the largest cryptocurrencies by market value, according to CoinMarketCap.
Mr. Musk's head, which took nearly six months to complete was made by Mr. Stone. The goat body and rocket were made by others in Phoenix to speed up the project, Mr. Sansalone said. Then all the pieces were put together and attached to the back of a 70-foot long semi-truck trailer.
""When I first saw the statue my jaw dropped,"" said DeMarco Hill, 51, who spotted it in September in Goodyear, Ariz., where he lives. He grabbed his 12-year-old son and they followed it. ""It was something you've never seen before in your life.""
Mr. Hill, a trucker who owns his own company, Stay Ready Trucking, thought the stunt was so entertaining that he found Mr. Sansalone and asked if he could participate. Mr. Sansalone said Mr. Hill was needed because only someone with a special license could drive around the heaping pile of metal.
He has since driven the sculpture through California, Arizona and Washington, before bringing it to Texas. People who drive by honk their horns or give a thumbs-up, Mr. Hill said.

""If I pull up to the side of the road it's like people crowding around,"" he said. ""It gets crazy.""
Mr. Sansalone said the sculpture has mostly gotten a positive response. He hasn't heard anyone mistaken Mr. Musk's face for someone else. ""I would say he is probably the most relevant person on the planet right now,"" Mr. Sansalone said about Mr. Musk, the world's richest person who recently bought Twitter Inc. for $44 billion .
In September, the sculpture sat in front of Tesla's office in Palo Alto, Calif., during the company's artificial-intelligence conference. Tesla employees crossed the street to take pictures with the sculpture, Mr. Sansalone said. Mr. Musk was at the conference, according to Twitter posts he made, and Mr. Sansalone assumes the billionaire saw the sculpture.
""All there was to look at was a lit-up rocket erected in the middle of the street,"" he said.
On Saturday night, the group remained hopeful.
At one point in the evening, a group of about 20 people who were waiting outside started to chant ""Elon claim your goat"" in the hopes that the god of crypto, as one co-founder put it, would hear them.
""I'm a huge fan of Elon and I want to give this man his flowers while he's alive,"" said Aamir Manzoor, a 36-year-old from Toronto who is a holder of Elon GOAT. ""He's done a lot for the world.""
Mr. Sansalone said supporters and holders of the cryptocurrency left at about 10 p.m. on Saturday. The plan now that Mr. Musk didn't accept the sculpture is to take it on tour.
Founders of the token are already planning an Elon Santa setup for Christmas and the launch of a toy drive for kids at hospitals, Mr. Sansalone said.

475,27-Nov-22,Orlando Sentinel,Can adding minerals to ocean curb climate change? Elon Musk backs UM grad's research,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2740232102/BFD812D457A14912PQ/710?accountid=13946,"Laura Stieghorst was sitting in the back of a University of Miami classroom in November 2021 when she got the email that would change her life.
As her professor lectured the class on sustainable development, Stieghorst, then a senior studying environmental science and policy, learned that Elon Musk - founder of Tesla and SpaceX, new owner of Twitter and the world's richest man - was about to give her a $100,000 grant to fund her research proposal to fight climate change.
""I just wanted to jump out of my seat,"" said Stieghorst, who graduated from UM in December.
She had applied for the money as part of the XPRIZE for Carbon Removal, a Musk-backed competition that promised to give 23 student-led research teams $100,000 grants to study ways to slow climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
When she submitted her proposal a month earlier, Stieghorst didn't expect to win. Now, as she stared at her laptop screen, it dawned on her that this money was about to launch her career. ""It was wonderful, and it was also scary,"" Stieghorst said, ""because it was like, 'Oh man, now I really have to do this. It's not just a proposal anymore - this will be my job now.' ""
The grant helped Stieghorst found Básico, a startup specializing in carbon removal research, and fund a collaboration with UM's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science.
Básico aims to test whether the world's oceans can be used to soak up carbon through a pioneering but unproven concept called ocean alkalinity enhancement, which involves mixing alkaline minerals into seawater. If Stieghorst's ambitious research succeeds, she could help create a new marine-based market where businesses and industries pay to remove carbon from the atmosphere to offset their carbon emissions.
Supercharging the ocean's CO2 sponge 
Scientists have been dreaming about fighting climate change through OAE since the 1990s.
""This idea has been kicking around for a long time,"" said Chris Langdon, a UM marine biology professor who partnered with Stieghorst to study the technology at his Virginia Key lab. ""I've been talking about it in lectures for years.""
But the technique also has been viewed as a long shot, and it hasn't attracted much funding through traditional research grants. Without the XPRIZE money, Langdon said he and the grad students who work in his lab wouldn't have been able to study it. ""Being able to actually buy supplies and equipment and pay a stipend to the students was all made possible by this funding.""
There is a reason why the technique is so intriguing. Oceans already are a sponge for carbon dioxide. They've absorbed about 30% of the CO2 human beings have pumped into the atmosphere since the dawn of the industrial revolution, according to a 2019 paper from an international team of scientists led by NOAA. OAE is envisioned as a booster shot of sorts that would increase the amount of carbon the oceans can absorb.
In theory, OAE should work like this: From shore sources, or potentially from ships in the future, alkaline minerals would be mixed into seawater. ""Alkaline"" is the opposite of ""acidic."" So boosting ocean alkalinity could have two benefits. First, it could reverse ocean acidification, a man-made phenomenon that has hurt coral and other sea life. And second - according to the laws of chemistry - more alkaline water should be able to absorb more carbon dioxide and slow climate change.
But so far, it remains a theory. No one has tested OAE thoroughly enough to say just how much carbon the strategy could remove from the atmosphere and - another critical question - whether it would harm sea creatures. That's where Básico comes in: The startup's first mission is to calculate how much carbon the concept actually captures and to test its impact on coral.
To do that, Langdon and a team of student researchers spent three months adding alkaline minerals to coral tanks at a UM lab on Virginia Key this summer. The team measured the impact of the minerals on coral health, and then raised the temperature in the tanks to see if the minerals helped the corals stay healthier under heat stress.
Meanwhile, Langdon's team added alkaline minerals to a 9,000-gallon wind and wave simulation tank to replicate how the minerals might behave in the ocean. Then, they measured how much extra carbon the seawater in the tank had absorbed.
The team hasn't yet published its findings. But Riley Palmer, a master's student in Langdon's lab who ran the coral research, said the minerals ""didn't have any negative impact on the corals.""
Carbon capture controversy 
OAE is just one of several strategies for carbon capture, the process of taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to slow the process of climate change. If startups like Básico can demonstrate that these techniques effectively capture carbon at a reasonable cost, then businesses can invest in carbon capture as a way to offset their own emissions and meet their climate goals.
Carbon capture has drawn scorn from some environmental activists, who point out that it's often hard to verify how much carbon these projects actually remove from the atmosphere. They also argue that ineffective carbon capture projects will give companies an excuse to keep emitting carbon while pretending to address climate change. Greenpeace, for instance, has excoriated what it calls ""the great carbon capture scam.""
But the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said carbon capture will be necessary to help the world avoid the worst effects of global warming. In April, UN climate scientists wrote that carbon capture is ""unavoidable"" if the world hopes to meet its climate goals.
Even if carbon capture catches on, it's still unclear whether OAE will be the method scientists and business owners embrace. Alternative techniques, like planting groves of trees or building machines that suck carbon dioxide out of the air and convert it into rocks, have already attracted billions of dollars in investment. OAE startups, meanwhile, are still working to prove how much carbon they can capture per dollar spent.
""It's really hard to measure how much carbon is being captured once it's in the ocean,"" said Stieghorst. ""From a theoretical perspective, this is an amazing solution. But from a business perspective, it would be easier to sell this solution if you had all the carbon stored in once place where you could hold it and count it and sell carbon credits against it.""
That's why Stieghorst applied for her $100,000 XPRIZE grant under the competition's ""measurement, reporting, and verification"" category, which is dedicated to funding research that proves how much carbon a certain technology can capture.
Stieghorst, who grew up in Coral Gables and graduated from Coral Gables High School, has since won a second $100,000 grant to continue her work as a climate entrepreneur. This time, the money came from Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian.
In June, Stieghorst was named one of 20 winners of the Ohanian-backed 776 Fellowship, which gives entrepreneurs under 23 a cash prize and two years of mentorship from Silicon Valley stalwarts to pursue their ideas to fight climate change.
Partnering with the Rosenstiel
Langdon was one of the few professors who believed in Stieghorst's project early on. In August 2021, Stieghorst invited UM students and professors to a talk on campus in which she explained OAE and tried to recruit members of the audience to help her apply for the XPRIZE grant. It was a tough crowd.
""During the Q&A portion, one chemistry professor just told me, straight up, 'This isn't going to work. Why would you work on this?' "" Stieghorst said.
But there was at least one friendly face in the crowd of about 25 students and faculty. ""She was cracking jokes and I was the only one who laughed,"" Langdon recalled. ""It's tough to convince professors of anything, and this is such a non-traditional approach to things that most of them didn't want to get involved.""
Even so, Langdon saw the potential in Stieghorst's idea. He joined the project a week later, along with a half dozen UM students. After a frenzied seven-week sprint to assemble their proposal - ""the most insane scramble I've ever experienced,"" Stieghorst says - the team submitted its application.
Now, a year later, Langdon says he's ""jazzed"" to be working on the project. ""For years I've been studying the problem, and people always ask, 'Well, when are you going to do something about it?' "" said Langdon. ""This is a chance to be part of the solution.""

476,28-Nov-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk Claims Apple Is Threatening to Remove Twitter From App Store; Twitter boss attacks iPhone maker and CEO Tim Cook over advertising and censorship,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2740563234/BFD812D457A14912PQ/360?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk said Apple Inc. is threatening to remove Twitter Inc. from its App Store and criticized the tech giant for what he called censorship. He also said the iPhone maker has withdrawn most of its advertising spending from the social-media company.
In a series of tweets Monday, Mr. Musk asked if Apple supports free speech and posted a poll asking users whether Apple should publish all censorship actions it has taken that affect its customers. Mr. Musk also asked Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook in a tweet, "" What's going on .""
""Apple has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won't tell us why,"" Mr. Musk said Monday. In another tweet, he asked : ""Who else has Apple censored?""
Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Twitter has been facing a wave of departures by advertisers since Mr. Musk bought the company last month . After initially pausing spending on the platform , many have begun shifting their digital ad spending to other corners of the internet, such as ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok, Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Meta Platforms Inc.'s Instagram, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. Mr. Musk recently said he wasn't sure how much financial runway Twitter still had and that bankruptcy wasn't out of the question .
Apple is one of the biggest advertisers on Twitter, spending an estimated $39 million to advertise on Twitter during the first 10 months of this year, which is mostly before Mr. Musk's takeover, according to the latest data available from ad-tracking company MediaRadar Inc.
Tensions between Mr. Musk, who runs Tesla Inc. and other companies in addition to Twitter, and Apple, the world's largest corporation by market value, have existed for years and have escalated since the billionaire took over the social-media company .
Last week Apple executive Phil Schiller, who oversees the company's App Store, deactivated his Twitter account, which he had used to promote Apple products. Also last week Mr. Musk said he would make his own smartphone if Apple and Google were to boot Twitter from their app stores.
""I certainly hope it does not come to that, but, yes, if there is no other choice, I will make an alternative phone,"" he tweeted.
Apple has strict policies regarding user-generated content on apps in the App Store. The company last year removed social-media apps Parler and Wimkin in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol . Apple told Parler it received complaints regarding objectionable content on the service and accusations the app was used to plan, coordinate and facilitate illegal activities, according to a notice provided to the Journal at the time by Parler's then-chief executive. Parler has since returned to the App Store after changing some of its content-moderation practices.
Google also temporarily removed Parler from its app store and gave Wimkin a warning in response to the kind of content their users posted around when the riot took place.
Mr. Musk's relationship with Apple was fraught even before he took over Twitter.
Mr. Musk turned to Mr. Cook around 2018 in a Hail Mary effort to find funding to keep Tesla afloat as it struggled with its Model 3 production.
Mr. Cook has said he has never spoken to Mr. Musk.
Tesla had become a recruiting ground for Apple as the tech giant explored its own car ambitions. Mr. Musk complained in a 2015 Bloomberg Businessweek article about Apple's attempts to poach his engineers. And he has lambasted the bigger company, saying in the German newspaper Handelsblatt that Apple hired those who couldn't handle working at Tesla. ""We always jokingly call Apple the 'Tesla Graveyard,'"" he was quoted saying in 2015.
His barbs seemed to become sharper in 2021 as Apple faced a legal battle with ""Fortnite"" developer Epic Games Inc. over the control the iPhone maker maintains with its devices and its more than one billion users.
Epic has accused Apple of holding an improper monopoly over the distribution of third-party apps onto the iPhone and forcing those software companies to use its in-app payment system. Epic has called Apple's 30% take unfair.
Apple has defended its business, saying the fees are in line with the industry norm and fair for the technology it provides. It mostly won a lawsuit by Epic though the two are continuing to fight in an appeals court.
Mr. Musk waded into the matter last year , before his interest to own Twitter was clear. He called Apple's fees ""a 30% tax on the internet"" in a tweet in May. ""Literally 10 times higher than it should be."" In July, he said the fees ""are a de facto global tax on the Internet.""
This month, Apple and Epic took the battle before the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals . The Justice Department also weighed in on the case, contending earlier this year that the district court ruling erred in its interpretation of U.S. antitrust law and warned that the ruling set a precedent for anticompetitive agreements.
A number of other software developers, including Spotify Technology SA, have sharply criticized how Apple manages its App Store and have pushed for governments around the world to force the company to loosen its controls on software distribution. New legislation in the European Union could force Apple to allow users to access app stores operated by third parties and permit them to download apps outside of its app store. The legislation is set to take effect next year.
Mr. Musk reiterated his criticism of Apple's software fees on Monday, tweeting ""Did you know Apple puts a secret 30% tax on everything you buy through their App Store?""

477,29-Nov-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk's Twitter Politics Add to Pressure on Tesla's Brand Image; Democrats in particular have soured on Tesla in recent weeks, survey finds, though the car maker's customers remain loyal",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2741097400/BFD812D457A14912PQ/9?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc.'s brand image in the U.S. has fallen in long-running surveys as the world's largest car maker by market value faces new regulatory challenges and Chief Executive Elon Musk wades further into politics in his bid to turn around Twitter Inc.
Tesla's reputation remains closely tied to that of Mr. Musk, whose fame has increased with his wealth and political activity. The decline in the perception of the company comes as it is also facing growing competition from rival electric-vehicle makers.
Self-identifying Democrats in particular have soured on the car maker since Mr. Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in late October, according to data from research firm Morning Consult. Mr. Musk, who plays a large role in the public image of Tesla and now Twitter, on Nov. 7 urged voters to back Republicans in the midterm elections. He later reinstated former President Donald Trump's Twitter account, delivering on his statement in May that he would do so.
The car maker's reputation was already on the decline broadly over the past two years, according to YouGov, a U.K.-based market-research company that runs daily surveys about thousands of brands.
On Nov. 7, for the first time since YouGov began tracking Tesla in 2016, more respondents in the U.S. reported a negative perception of Tesla than a positive view. The brand perception has eroded further since, according to YouGov data.
Scores for other major U.S. auto makers have held steady during the same period, with each brand consistently scoring higher than Tesla on net favorability ratings from January 2020 until the present, according to YouGov data. Net favorability is the percentage of respondents with positive perceptions of a brand minus the percentage with negative perceptions.
Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment.
Morning Consult also found that more people hold a negative view of Tesla than at the start of the year. In surveys of about 200 people in the U.S. each day this month through Nov. 27, roughly 22% had a negative impression of the company, compared with 15% in January.
Morning Consult said 38% of those surveyed this month through Nov. 27 had a positive impression of Tesla, down from 43% in January.
Morning Consult said a partisan divide is also emerging.
Tesla's net favorability among self-described Democrats in the U.S. fell to an average of 10.4% this month through Nov. 27, down from an average of 24.8% in October, according to Morning Consult. It rose to 26.5% from 20% among self-described Republicans during the same period.
""It seems like Tesla is on its way to becoming a partisan brand,"" said Jordan Marlatt, tech analyst at Morning Consult.
YouGov found that self-described liberals now view Tesla more negatively than conservatives, though conservatives also have a negative view of the brand on average, according to the firm's most recent data.
Mr. Musk's takeover of Twitter has also coincided with deepening economic uncertainty and increased concern about flagging vehicle demand. Tesla executives have waved off such concerns, though the company has cut full-year growth expectations.
""I can't emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into the future as we can see,"" Mr. Musk told analysts in October after Tesla reported nearly $3.3 billion in third-quarter profit .
Those who already own a Tesla remain committed to the brand. In the second quarter, the car maker enjoyed the highest brand loyalty among mainstream or luxury car brands in the U.S., S&P Global Mobility data shows. Tesla also has millions of active supporters online, as does Mr. Musk.
But federal prosecutors and securities regulators have launched probes examining whether the car maker misled consumers about how its advanced driver-assistance system known as Autopilot performs, The Wall Street Journal has reported, and a federal auto-safety investigation of the technology is under way.
More battery-powered vehicles have meanwhile hit the U.S. market, from the electric version of Ford Motor Co.'s F-150 to Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd.'s Ioniq 5. Tesla's share of the domestic EV market fell to 61% in the third quarter, from 71% a year earlier according to S&P Global Mobility.
Tesla's share price has tumbled around 49% in 2022, outpacing the stock-price declines of automotive rivals and erasing nearly $500 billion in market value. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, by comparison, has fallen roughly 30% over the same period.
Tesla's most significant business challenges have been greater competition from other auto makers and declining consumer confidence in the quality of its products, said Ian Beavis, chief strategy officer at automotive consulting firm AMCI Global, part of ad-holding company Omnicom Group Inc.
The number of consumers who had a negative opinion of Tesla's product quality has grown to 12.5% on Nov. 16 from 4.2% on Nov. 16, 2020, according to YouGov. The majority of respondents in each survey had no opinion.
But Tesla is likely to have trouble distancing itself from its chief executive if he delves further into politics in a way that risks further damaging the brand's reputation among some U.S. consumers, said Richard Levick, chairman and chief executive of public-relations firm Levick.
More than 94% of U.S. adults are now familiar with Mr. Musk, up from about 75% one year ago, according to Mr. Marlatt of Morning Consult.
""It's very, very hard to separate the company from the man,"" Mr. Levick said. ""He has a lot more critics than he used to.""

478,29-Nov-22,Barron's (Online),Oil Prices Weaken but Here's Why Any Good Feeling Won't Last Long,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2740838257/BFD812D457A14912PQ/585?accountid=13946,"Crude prices on Monday briefly dropped below the level at which they started the year. Given the spike in oil prices has been the source of a lot of pain, it's worth taking a step back to consider the implications.
Energy prices were creeping up at the start of the year as the global economy emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. Supply lines weren't running smoothly after two years of lockdown-induced slumps, and demand was strengthening as consumers emerged from their shells.
Then Russia started a war in Ukraine, causing prices to surge on concern that supply from one of the world's biggest producers might be cut off. That sent inflation soaring, eroding purchasing power for consumers everywhere, and forcing the Federal Reserve into action with the most aggressive interest-rate increases in a generation.
One reason oil prices have retreated is because Russian supplies were never cut off. They may not be feeding into Europe, but output will continue to go to Asia even as the Group of Seven wrangle over implementing a price cap .
Another is that Covid-19 lockdowns in China have dented demand in the world's biggest crude importer. Social unrest in protest at these policies is unlikely to strengthen the economy now.
Finally, higher interest rates the world over are poison for growth and will keep global energy needs contained for a while yet. The Fed, having been slow to start hiking after a decade of borderline deflation, now looks determined to save face by extending the fight against faster price gains into 2024.
After all the worry about an energy crisis earlier this year, lower prices may feel like a relief. But the reason costs are down is a gloomy economic outlook. And that's why any good feeling won't last long.

Fed Officials Say Further Tightening Needed to Tame Inflation
St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told MarketWatch the central bank will likely need to keep its benchmark policy rate above 5% for most of 2023 and into 2024 to succeed in taming inflation, reinforcing the higher-for-longer mantra embraced by Fed officials lately.
* Bullard said inflation will be stickier than investors expect, adding that the Fed needs to maintain aggressive downward pressure ""until it's clear"" inflation has receded to 2%, rather than risk easing up prematurely and letting prices spiral out of control.
* New York Fed President John Williams said while inflationary pressures should recede over the next year, the central bank could require further tightening of monetary policy to slow economic activity, demand, and wage growth to reach the Fed's 2% target rate.
* Williams, a top lieutenant to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, didn't push back against expectations that the central bank will lift rates by a half percentage point at its Dec. 13-14 meeting, The Wall Street Journal reported.
* The Federal Reserve has faced criticism for waiting until March 2022 to raise interest rates after inflation spiked in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Fed Vice Chairwoman Lael Brainard noted that even countries that hiked earlier failed to avoid the global rise in prices.
What's Next: Powell is scheduled to discuss the economic outlook, inflation, and the labor market on Wednesday at the Brookings Institution's Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy in Washington, as the Fed prepares for its next policy meeting in December.

Elon Musk Pokes Apple CEO Over Advertising Pullback
Twitter CEO Elon Musk unleashed a tweet storm against Apple, saying it is threatening to remove Twitter from its App Store, accusing the tech giant of engaging in censorship, and claiming it has mostly stopped advertising on the social media platform. He asked Apple CEO Tim Cook: ""What's going on here?""
* Musk's tweets asked if Apple supports free speech and accused the tech giant of imposing ""a secret 30% tax"" on third-party apps in its App store. Apple didn't immediately respond to Barron's request for comment.
* Advertisers have been leaving Twitter since Musk bought the social media company in October, migrating their digital ad spending to competitors including ByteDance's TikTok, Alphabet's Google, and Meta Platforms' Instagram, The Wall Street Journal reported.
* Apple spent an estimated $39 million on advertising on Twitter during the first 10 months of 2022, before the Tesla CEO bought the company, according to data from ad-tracking company MediaRadar. Musk tweeted about the ""massive drop in revenue"" after advertisers withdrew.
* Apple has policies regarding user-generated content on apps in the App Store. Last year it removed social-media apps Parler and Wimkin after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, telling Parler it got complaints about objectionable content. Parler has returned to the App Store after changing some content-moderation rules.
What's Next: Worker protests at Apple supplier Foxconn's largest factory in Zhengzhou, China, could cause an iPhone production shortfall of 5% to 10%, analysts at Wedbush estimated. Apple has begun producing some iPhone models in India and other nations.

Biden Asks Congress to Help Avert Railroad Strike
President Joe Biden late Monday called on Congress to pass a law that imposes a tentative deal to avert a rail strike that has been rejected by rail union members.
* Railroad and labor negotiators have until early Dec. 9 to avoid a strike or management lockout under standstill arrangements with four unions—the members of which rejected a tentative deal that previously staved off a strike threat on Sept. 15. Only Congress has statutory power to intervene and prevent a stoppage.
* ""Let me be clear,"" said Biden's statement, ""a rail shutdown would devastate our economy. Without freight rail, many U.S. industries would shut down."" As many as 765,000 Americans could be put out of work in the first two weeks of a rail strike, he said.
* With some 30% of the country's freight tonnage carried by rail, a strike could cost $2 billion a day. Unless Congress intervenes—or the parties agree to a settlement or extension by 12:01 a.m. on Dec. 9—either side could stop the freight trains.
* September's deal, ratified by eight of the 12 unions, gives workers a 24% pay increase over the contract's five years. The dissatisfied labor groups object to limits on paid sick-leave that make emergency absences hard for workers to arrange, according to unions.
What's Next: With railroads likely to halt shipments of hazardous materials at least four days before the Dec. 9 deadline, Congress is rapidly running out of time to prevent major disruption.

Bob Iger is Focusing on Creativity, Profitability at Disney
Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger told employees at his first companywide town hall since retaking the reins of the entertainment giant that he will empower Disney's creative teams, chase profitability in streaming instead of adding subscribers, and spend money where it would add value for the company.
* Iger, Disney's CEO from 2005 to 2020, sought to reassure Disney employees and shareholders after a year of unpopular changes under previous CEO Bob Chapek. He said he plans to keep the hiring freeze Chapek started, but didn't mention the layoffs that Chapek warned about.
* Chapek increased Disney's content spending to around $30 billion this fiscal year, but charged subscribers far less for Disney+ than rivals including Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO Max do for their services, The Wall Street Journal reported. Losses for Disney's streaming division ballooned to $1.47 billion in the most recent quarter.
* Iger said employees need to be skeptical about the future of traditional television amid the rise of streaming services such as Disney+. Iger called the idea of a potential sale to a company like Apple ""pure speculation,"" cautioning against expecting any deals soon.
* When asked about the public disagreements with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Disney's position on Florida's legislation limiting discussion of gender identity in schools, Iger said Disney's LGBT employees are very important and that Disney cares deeply about them, the Journal reported.
What's Next: Iger said he ""will look into"" Disney's plan to relocate its ""imagineers,"" the engineers and designers of its theme park rides, to Florida from Southern California in 2026. He will also examine Disney's online theme-park reservation system, introduced when they reopened following pandemic closures.

BlockFi Seeks Bankruptcy as Questions About FTX's Collapse Swirl
Crypto lending firm BlockFi Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection in New Jersey, a result of the collateral damage caused by the bankruptcy of FTX, which had come to its rescue earlier this year but was forced to halt withdrawals after FTX's collapse.
* BlockFi was among the biggest firms to offer investors high yields in exchange for depositing cryptocurrency, at one time garnering more than $10 billion worth of deposits of Bitcoin and other tokens. FTX's Alameda Research defaulted on $680 million owed to BlockFi, The Wall Street Journal reported , citing court papers.
* BlockFi owes its top 10 creditors nearly $1.2 billion, according to filings and its liabilities to customers are far larger, including about $730 million outstanding to Ankura Trust Company, the trustee for BlockFi's interest-bearing U.S. customer accounts.
* Tech investor Peter Thiel is caught in the collateral damage, too. Valar Ventures, a venture-capital firm spun out from Thiel Capital, owned 19% of BlockFi's shares, according to court documents, making it one of BlockFi's largest shareholders, the Journal reported .
* FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has confirmed he will participate in the New York Times' DealBook Summit on Wednesday as investors, regulators, prosecutors and lawmakers press to get an account of what happened at the crypto exchange.
What's Next: The Senate Agriculture Committee has scheduled a hearing at 10 a.m. Eastern time on Thursday to discuss lessons learned from the FTX collapse. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam is scheduled to testify.

 Oil Prices Weaken but Here's Why Any Good Feeling Won't Last Long

479,30-Nov-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition","Politics of Social Media Pressure Tesla --- The auto maker's reputation has taken a hit, surveys find, but customers are loyal",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2741194158/BFD812D457A14912PQ/80?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc.'s brand image in the U.S. has fallen in long-running surveys as the world's largest car maker by market value faces new regulatory challenges and Chief Executive Elon Musk wades further into politics in his bid to turn around Twitter Inc.
Tesla's reputation remains closely tied to that of Mr. Musk, whose fame has increased with his wealth and political activity. The decline in the perception of the company comes as it is facing growing competition from rival electric-vehicle makers. Self-identifying Democrats in particular have soured on the car maker since Mr. Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in late October, according to data from research firm Morning Consult. Mr. Musk, who plays a large role in the public image of Tesla and now Twitter, on Nov. 7 urged voters to back Republicans in the midterm elections. He later reinstated former President Donald Trump's Twitter account, delivering on his statement in May that he would do so.
The car maker's reputation was on the decline broadly over the past two years, according to YouGov, a U.K. market-research company that runs daily surveys about thousands of brands.
On Nov. 7, for the first time since YouGov began tracking Tesla in 2016, more respondents in the U.S. reported a negative perception of Tesla than a positive view. The brand perception has eroded further since, according to YouGov data. Scores for other major U.S. auto makers have held steady during the same period, with each brand consistently scoring higher than Tesla on net favorability ratings from January 2020 until the present, according to YouGov data. Net favorability is the percentage of respondents with positive perceptions of a brand minus the percentage with negative perceptions.
Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment.
Morning Consult found that more people hold a negative view of Tesla than at the start of the year. In surveys of about 200 people in the U.S. each day this month through Nov. 27, roughly 22% had a negative impression of the company, compared with 15% in January. Morning Consult said 38% of those surveyed this month through Nov. 27 had a positive impression of Tesla, down from 43% in January. Morning Consult said a partisan divide is emerging.
Tesla's net favorability among self-described Democrats in the U.S. fell to an average of 10.4% this month through Nov. 27, down from an average of 24.8% in October, according to Morning Consult. It rose to 26.5% from 20% among self-described Republicans during the same period.
""It seems like Tesla is on its way to becoming a partisan brand,"" said Jordan Marlatt, tech analyst at Morning Consult.
YouGov found self-described liberals now view Tesla more negatively than conservatives, though conservatives also have a negative view of the brand on average, according to the firm's most recent data.
Mr. Musk's takeover of Twitter has coincided with deepening economic uncertainty and increased concern about flagging vehicle demand. Tesla executives have waved off such concerns, though the company has cut full-year growth expectations.
""I can't emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into the future as we can see,"" Mr. Musk told analysts in October after Tesla reported nearly $3.3 billion in third-quarter profit.
Those who own a Tesla remain committed to the brand. In the second quarter, the car maker enjoyed the highest brand loyalty among mainstream or luxury car brands in the U.S., S&P Global Mobility data shows. Tesla also has millions of active supporters online, as does Mr. Musk.
But federal prosecutors and securities regulators have launched probes examining whether the car maker misled consumers about how its advanced driver-assistance system known as Autopilot performs, The Wall Street Journal has reported, and a federal auto-safety investigation of the technology is under way.
Meanwhile, more battery-powered vehicles have hit the U.S. market, from the electric version of Ford Motor Co.'s F-150 to Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd.'s Ioniq 5. Tesla's share of the domestic electric-vehicle market fell to 61% in the third quarter from 71% a year earlier according to S&P Global Mobility.
Tesla's share price has tumbled around 49% in 2022, outpacing the stock-price declines of automotive rivals and erasing nearly $500 billion in market value. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, by comparison, has fallen roughly 30% over the same period.
Tesla's most significant business challenges have been greater competition from other auto makers and declining consumer confidence in the quality of its products, said Ian Beavis, chief strategy officer at automotive consulting firm AMCI Global, part of ad-holding company Omnicom Group Inc.
The number of consumers who had a negative opinion of Tesla's product quality has grown to 12.5% on Nov. 16 from 4.2% on Nov. 16, 2020, according to YouGov.
The majority of respondents in each survey had no opinion.
But Tesla is likely to have trouble distancing itself from its chief executive if he delves further into politics in a way that risks further damaging the brand's reputation among some U.S. consumers, said Richard Levick, chairman and chief executive of public-relations firm Levick.
More than 94% of U.S. adults are now familiar with Mr. Musk, up from about75% one year ago, according to Mr. Marlatt of Morning Consult.
""It's very, very hard to separate the company from the man,"" Mr. Levick said. ""He has a lot more critics than he used to.""

480,30-Nov-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Twitter Becomes Stage for China Protests Despite Ban by Beijing; Chinese users employ VPNs to get videos and images out of the country, while fighting spam",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2742640147/BFD812D457A14912PQ/622?accountid=13946,"HONG KONG—Twitter is banned in China, but it is proving a critical platform for getting videos and images of protests occurring across the nation out to the rest of the world.
China's robust internet censors have sprung into action to scrub domestic social media of photos and video streams showing demonstrations against harsh Covid restrictions, spurring citizens to circumvent the nation's Great Firewall.
Twitter has been blocked in China since 2009, but people in the country are able to access it using virtual private networks, or VPNs, which disguise their locations. They can then send material via the platform's messaging system to a handful of widely followed Twitter users, who in turn broadcast it globally .
One Twitter user who lives outside China and goes by the name of Li Laoshi, or Teacher Li, said he has been receiving more than a dozen messages per second with protest material at some points since public unrest erupted—the same number he used to get a day—so that he could repost them publicly.
""My daily routine is: wake up, post online, and feed my cat,"" he said. The goal of the account, created in May 2020, is to record events that are subject to censorship in China, his profile states. It had more than 759,000 followers as of Wednesday, more than triple the number before protests began, according to social-media analytics site Social Blade.
Amid the protests , some search terms related to the protests have been flooded with pornography and other spam from what appear to be bot accounts, based on the high frequency of their postings and low follower counts, among other factors. Searches on Twitter in simplified Chinese in recent days for the names of large Chinese cities where protests occurred returned thousands of tweets containing advertisements for sexual services or meaningless content such as time stamps.
Twitter also faced demands to reinstate at least two Twitter users who were posting content from the protests in recent days. The account owners said Twitter suspended their accounts citing violations of its rules against platform manipulation and spam. Both said they were wrongly banned and other Twitter users jumped to their defense. The accounts were later restored.
Twitter didn't respond to a request for comment.
How Twitter handles such issues as China experiences its most widespread public dissent in decades will be an early test for the platform's new owner, Elon Musk, who has pledged to allow largely unfettered free speech on the platform and to tackle the problem of bots. Mr. Musk's Tesla Inc. relies heavily on China to manufacture its cars and as a sales market.
Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have been used in years past as tools of the opposition in insurrections against regimes that control the flow of information. Protesters used Facebook to communicate during the 2011 Egyptian revolution, while Twitter allowed Iranian protesters to alert the rest of the world about demonstrations there in 2009. More recently, activists whose street protests precipitated the military overthrow of Sudan's longtime leader relied on social media in 2019 to spread the word.
Twitter has grown into a propaganda battleground for China in recent years as Beijing seeks to strengthen its global image and influence. Beijing has promoted its narratives on Twitter through a growing network of diplomatic and state-media accounts, and jailed dozens of people who use Twitter and other foreign platforms to allegedly disrupt public order and attack party rule.
Chinese authorities could pressure Twitter to address the content pertaining to the protests or try to hack accounts to stop it from further sharing information, said Patrick Poon, a human-rights activist and visiting scholar at Japan's Meiji University who analyzes free speech.
""It's definitely a test for Elon Musk and Twitter on how it will protect its users from hacking by authoritarian regimes,"" Mr. Poon said.
Photos: Rare Protests Exploded Across China Over Covid Controls
China's State Council Information Office and the Cyberspace Administration of China didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Even though most people post on Twitter under pseudonyms, Chinese authorities have kept close tabs on those critical of the government on the platform. They have at times arrested or detained users over their activities on Twitter.
The rise of spam on protest-related content ""points to this being an intentional attack to throw up informational chaff and reduce external visibility into protests in China,"" Alex Stamos, the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory who was until 2018 Facebook's chief security officer, wrote on Twitter on Monday.
""Looks like we might have the first major failure to stop gov interference in the Musk era,"" he wrote.
Twitter has seen a wave of departures among its staff who moderate content, try to root out inflammatory material such as hate speech and defend against propaganda campaigns, with some analysts saying the company could be less well equipped to deal with attacks on accounts sharing material.
Chinese state-backed information operations have long taken place on Twitter but have been growing, analysts say.
Mr. Musk has complained for years about Twitter's ability to measure and manage bots , the automated accounts on the platform that often produce spam.
Asked by a user on Twitter on Wednesday whether he was making progress removing bots generally on the platform, Mr. Musk said the company was, adding: ""You should see some improvement by tomorrow.""
Vickie Wang, a freelance writer and stand-up comedian in Taipei who had been retweeting videos and photos of protests , along with images of cats, to her roughly 500 followers, said her account was suspended Wednesday.
Twitter said in a message to her that the platform can't be used ""in a manner intended to artificially amplify or suppress information or engage in behavior that manipulates or disrupts people's experience on Twitter.""
""I've read through the entire page about spam and platform manipulation and I've done none of those things,"" said Ms. Wang. A review of her most recent activity over 24 hours showed she had mostly retweeted others in about a dozen tweets.
Another Twitter user reported her account was also suspended for the same reason, saying she didn't know what she had done to trigger the ban.
Twitter didn't respond to questions about the suspensions. Both Ms. Wang's and the other user's accounts were reinstated Wednesday shortly after The Wall Street Journal inquired about them.

481,1-Dec-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Tesla Set to Deliver Semi Truck to PepsiCo, Expanding Beyond Passenger Vehicles; Car company is slated to host event Thursday to mark the occasion",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2743386461/BFD812D457A14912PQ/148?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc. is poised to deliver its first all-electric semitrailer truck Thursday, marking the company's long-delayed expansion beyond the passenger vehicle market.
Food and beverage maker PepsiCo Inc. is expected to take delivery of the Semi, five years after Elon Musk revealed the model.
The Semi, originally due out in 2019, would be the first new model Tesla is putting in customer hands since early 2020, when the company began delivering its Model Y crossover.
Tesla is slated to host an event to mark the occasion in the Reno, Nev., area, where it has been producing the Semi and jointly operates a battery factory. A live-stream is expected to begin around 5 p.m. local time, according to PepsiCo. Mr. Musk has said he plans to attend.
The Tesla chief executive introduced the concept in 2017 as Tesla was struggling to mass-produce its Model 3 sedan, promising a truck that would travel 500 miles on a single charge and be cheaper to operate than a diesel competitor.
This year, Tesla's stock is down around 45% through Thursday as the company grapples with greater competition, regulatory scrutiny and investor unease over Mr. Musk's acquisition of Twitter Inc. Tesla's stock-price decline has eclipsed that of other major auto makers, as well as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index.
Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on issues including the number of trucks it plans to deliver to PepsiCo and their price tag.
PepsiCo declined to comment on those topics. The company has said the trucks would support plants in Sacramento and Modesto, Calif. A typical diesel-powered semitrailer truck costs around $120,000 in the U.S., according to consulting firm Roland Berger.
PepsiCo's Frito-Lay unit has teamed up with a local public health agency to replace its diesel-powered freight equipment in Modesto with 15 Tesla semitrailer trucks, among other vehicles and equipment. The California Air Resources Board has committed to funding half of that $30.8 million overhaul.
Tesla's planned delivery of its Semi comes after President Biden in August signed into law legislation creating a new tax credit of up to $40,000 for commercial electric vehicles beginning in 2023, among other incentives.
 EV Rivals Aiming for Tesla's Crown in China 
Several other companies, including Daimler Truck Holding AG and Volvo AB, have been developing electric semitrailer trucks, though the market remains nascent. The scarcity of charging infrastructure capable of powering up heavy trucks means they are better suited for shorter trips close to a central hub than they are for long-haul routes, said Wilfried Aulbur, who runs Roland Berger's commercial-vehicle-consulting practice.
Tesla's Semi is unusual in that it was designed from the ground-up to be electric, rather than being a modified version of a diesel truck, Dr. Aulbur said.
The Semi will be capable of accelerating from zero to 60 miles an hour in 20 seconds and recharging up to 70% of its range in half an hour, Tesla says on its website. In keeping with Tesla's propensity for unusual design elements, the Semi's cab features a single, centrally located seat. The steering wheel is flanked by two display screens.
""By removing the motor and the transmission in front of the vehicle, we could put the driver in the middle for the best command view,"" Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla's chief designer, recently told CNBC .
Tesla is aiming to produce 50,000 Semi trucks in 2024 in North America, Mr. Musk said in October. He previously said battery-cell supply constraints made scaling truck production difficult. For now, output remains limited. Tesla might produce 100 semitrailer trucks this year, Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm said during a recent trial over Mr. Musk's compensation package at Tesla. Internal projections from early 2018 contemplated producing thousands of the trucks, she said.
Thursday's event comes as Tesla pushes to deliver as many vehicles as possible in the final weeks of the year. The company cut its annual growth expectations this fall, saying it expects to finish the year just shy of its 2022 target of boosting vehicle deliveries by 50%.
Tesla is offering a $3,750 credit to U.S. customers who buy certain Model 3s or Model Ys for delivery this month, according to the company's website.
Mr. Musk, who runs Twitter and rocket company SpaceX in addition to Tesla, has said he has been spending much of his time recently running the social-media company. At Twitter, Mr. Musk has encountered some challenges engaging with consumer brands. Many have paused advertising on the platform , citing concern over how it would evolve under Mr. Musk. Tesla's brand image, meanwhile, has fallen in long-running surveys.
The serial entrepreneur spoke Wednesday at an event for Neuralink Corp. , a neuroscience startup working on brain-implant technologies that he co-founded.

""If you're a truck driver and you want the most bad-ass rig on the road, this is it,"" Mr. Musk said. He called the truck ""a crucial piece of the puzzle"" that is Tesla's mission to accelerate a transition to more-sustainable energy, noting that heavy-duty trucks account for an outsize share of vehicle emissions.

On Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank could begin moderating the pace of its interest rate hikes ""as soon as the December meeting,"" which is scheduled for Dec. 14. Investors cheered the possibility of a less aggressive Fed, sending the S&P 500 up 3% and the Nasdaq Composite up 4.4% on Wednesday.
On Friday, the Labor Department reported the U.S. economy added 263,000 jobs in November, beating economist estimates of 200,000 jobs. The unemployment rate remained steady at 3.7%, and hourly wages were up 5.1% from a year ago.
Tesla CEO and Twitter owner Elon Musk visited Apple headquarters and met with Apple CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday to resolve what Musk classified as a ""misunderstanding"" about Twitter potentially being removed from Apple's App Store. The meeting came after Musk went on a tweet storm earlier in the day accusing Apple of censoring its users and opposing free speech.
On Monday, cryptocurrency lender BlockFi declared bankruptcy, becoming the latest victim of the 2022 crypto winter. In its bankruptcy filing, BlockFi noted that it had a $275 million outstanding loan to crypto exchange FTX, which itself filed for bankruptcy earlier in the month.

On Wednesday, Chinese electric vehicle company Xpeng reported earnings and revenue misses in the third quarter, but its stock still rallied to finish the week higher by more than 67%.
In the week ahead, investors will get more quarterly reports from GameStop and Campbell Soup on Wednesday and Chewy and DocuSign on Thursday.
Analysts are projecting S&P 500 earnings will decline 2.1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, according to FactSet.

484,5-Dec-22,Columbian,Elon Musk won't win his fight against Apple,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2746506496/BFD812D457A14912PQ/415?accountid=13946,"What do I care about more? Do I care about my iPhone, my iPad, my MacBook and the two Mac desktops — or do I care more about the feed on my Twitter app? Oh, and I forgot to mention my Apple Watch.Guess the answer.I used to greatly admire Twitter owner Elon Musk for his championing of electric vehicles. That Tesla (and the rocket company SpaceX) made him the world's richest man was fine with me. No problem here with billionaires who build great things and pay their taxes.But Musk can't possibly think that he can win his fight against Apple, the world's most valuable company. Even if that were a possibility, he's not going about it the right way. Of course, that's assuming his motive is to indeed win and not just Gorilla-glue his name to the daily headlines.Let's accept everyone's arguments at face value. In the name of free speech, Musk is opening Twitter to unmoderated bigots, vaccine deniers and other assorted creeps. That's his right. Twitter is his toy to play with or break.Apple, on the other hand, wants to keep the worst nastiness out of its users' faces. It has thus banned from its App Store sites that do not meet its standards for moderating content. That is Apple's right.And it's the right of Apple and other big corporations to not advertise on the burning dumpster Twitter is becoming. Apple also has the right to demand a 30 percent cut from software developers wanting to put their wares on Apple devices — just as Twitter can charge users $8 a month for blue check marks.‘Not WW3'At the end of the day, what is Musk's weapon, really? A social media app?“This is a battle for the future of civilization,” Musk tweeted grandiosely. “If free speech is lost even in America, tyranny is all that lies ahead.”To which former Rep. Adam Kinzinger tweeted, “It's twitter man. Not WW3.”Musk overpaid $44 billion to buy Twitter. Apple, on the other hand, is worth $2.3 trillion. (The oil giant Saudi Aramco has a market value of $1.9 trillion.)Investors, meanwhile, have limited patience with CEOs who get distracted from their core business and come off as jerks. Who is taking care of Tesla? And aren't Musk's provocations turning off would-be buyers of his electric cars?This has been a tough year for many stocks, but for Tesla's, it's been miserable. As of late November, Tesla shares have lost nearly 50 percent of their value. The 2022 return on Apple shares (which includes dividends) was down only 18.31 percent.Dan Ives, a tech analyst, has called Musk's Twitter fight with Apple “the gift that keeps on giving for the Tesla ‘bears,' ” investors who bet on the stock price going down.Apple world tends to be a gentle place. Its inhabitants undoubtedly like the company's moves to protect user privacy.Apple also wins applause for banning misinformation about COVID-19 — something Twitter has just said it would now allow.By the way, it's simply not true that only liberal social media gets the Apple green light. Anyone who has used Apple products to follow political opinion knows that conservative views are easy to find.It would appear that all the money in the world couldn't buy Musk a sense of humor. And that's what he's going to need if the day comes that Apple drops Twitter from the App Store and the 1 billion iPhone owners start forgetting that Twitter ever existed.Apple sells real stuff, things that need to be recharged. Twitter does not. It's just an app that the delete button can make disappear. M"

Estimating wealth is more art than science, so $190 billion is little more than a guess. The precise ownership stake in private companies is hard to determine. And just how much debt a billionaire has is also tough to tell.
With $190 billion, Musk would be just above the estimated $185 billion net worth of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vitton (MC.France) CEO Bernard Arnault .
Musk, by Barron's math, would lose his top spot at about $166 a share for Tesla stock, depending, of course, on what LVMH shares do. Tesla stock closed at $167.87 on Nov. 21. That was the 52-week low closing price for shares.
Through Thursday trading, Tesla stock is off about 51% so far this year, wiping out more than $500 billion in market value. The move has cost Musk about $100 billion in net worth.
Tesla stock is down for a few reasons. Rising interest rates and inflation have hit most automotive stocks. General Motors (GM) shares are down about 35% year to date. Price cuts and incentives for Tesla vehicles have left investors wondering about electric vehicle demand.
Then there is Twitter. Tesla stock is off about 23% since Musk completed the purchase of the platform. The Nasdaq Composite is up about 3% over the same span.
There is a Twitter overhang on Tesla stock partly because of fears that Musk will have to sell stock to fund losses at Twitter. Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Musk was considering a margin loan using Tesla stock for collateral to inject more capital into Twitter. Tesla and Twitter didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
It's all been a lot for investors, and Musk, to handle. The end result is a lot of wealth has been destroyed.
When Musk took over the top spot on wealth tables, he gloated , a little, tweeting out a silver medal emoji to Jeff Bezos, the man he displaced at the top. Maybe Arnault will do something similar if he becomes the richest.

486,9-Dec-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk's Tweeting Is Problematic for Tesla Stock. Here's Proof.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2748298092/BFD812D457A14912PQ/93?accountid=13946,"Twitter is an undeniable overhang for Tesla stock. Investors feel it, Wall Street believes it, and now the data say so. What no one knows is how long the overhang will last—or if it will get worse.New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu took to Twitter on Friday to explain what's going on with Tesla stock (ticker: TSLA), which was off 49% so far this year as of the close on Friday. He attributed the bulk of the decline to what's happened to the market, which seems sensible. The Nasdaq Composite is off about 30% year to date, and most car-related stocks have been hit hard by rising interest rates and inflation. General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) shares are off about 35% and 36%, respectively, so far this year.

Twitter is also a factor for Ferragu, who noted that perceptions of Tesla's brand are sliding. Tesla's net brand favorability score, which is positive opinions minus negative opinions, is down about six to 10 percentage points, hovering around 20%. That tops the the U.S. government's score, which is less than zero, according to Ferragu's data.
Ferragu rates Tesla stock at Buy with a Street-high price target of $530, according to FactSet.
""Impact on brand perception in the general public is visible and material, but it is very unlikely to affect materially buying behaviors in the near term,"" Ferragu tells Barron's in an emailed statement, adding ""it will turn fast."" Just how long a temporary impact will last is anyone's guess. The Twitter overhang led Wedbush analyst Dan Ives to cut $50 off his price target for Tesla stock in November, leaving it at $250. He has called Twitter an albatross for Tesla stock, but still rates shares at Buy.
""Tweet by tweet, Musk creates more of an overhang on Tesla,"" Ives told Barron's Friday by email. ""The Musk Twitter fiasco a darkening black cloud over the story. Perception is reality for the Street for now on Tesla.""
Tesla CEO Elon Musk's recent tweets include shots at competitors , discussions of election interference by Twitter, disapproval of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy , and claims of media bias . Those tweets were all this week. Tesla investors still get tidbits about the car company from Musk's tweeting. He responded to Ferragu's thread, commenting that margin loans of Tesla stock don't make sense in this weakening economic environment.
That's a bit of good news for Tesla shareholders who don't like Musk selling Tesla stock , and don't want any sales tied to margin calls. Still, the possibility of Musk selling stock to help fund Twitter remains part of the overall overhang. Ferragu dismissed Musk selling Tesla stock as a long-term risk, though, writing that the sales would be ""negligible to the market cap and trading volumes of [Tesla]."" If Musk's stock sales aren't the main cause of the overhang on the Tesla brand and shares, then that leaves the toll that Twitter takes on Musk's full attention. Whatever the source, the impact is real.
Coming into Thursday, Tesla shares had declined about 23% since Musk completed the purchase of the social medial platform. The Nasdaq Composite has risen about 3% over the same span. The spread is growing. It was negligible until early November, when Musk sold more Tesla stock after the deal close— a surprise to investors. After the sale, the spread was about 20 percentage points. It moved as high as 26 points this week, but had slipped back to 22 points as of the close of trading on Friday.
Tesla stock has been cut almost in half year to date. If Tesla stock were at the level it sold for before Musk completed the Twitter purchase, it would be off about 34% year to date, in line with GM and Ford stock.
The performance gap between Tesla and the rest of the car industry is the gain that investors can expect from Tesla stock if the Twitter overhang ever lifts.
That would put Tesla stock at roughly $225 a share. Investors hope for that rally soon. Tesla stock closed 3.2% higher on Friday. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite both lost 0.7%. The stock snapped a four-day losing streak that cost investors about 11%. Tesla stock is now down about 8% for the week.

 Elon Musk's Tweeting Is Problematic for Tesla Stock. Here's Proof.

487,9-Dec-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition","Elon Musk Slashes Bureaucracy, Giving Twitter a Chance to Soar",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2748109003/BFD812D457A14912PQ/582?accountid=13946,"Since Elon Musk purchased Twitter, he has undertaken a rapid restructuring that few large technology companies would attempt unless faced with an immediate liquidity crisis. Minutes after closing his purchase of the company, he started a process that reduced the workforce from 7,500 to 2,500 in 10 days.
Media pundits immediately slammed him, arguing that his slash-and-burn strategy would destroy one of the world's most important social-media platforms -- already in danger under the burden of $14 billion in debt. Much of this criticism came in the form of tweets, as the irony of using Twitter to denounce Twitter apparently escaped Mr. Musk's critics. But the restructuring of Twitter won't destroy the company.
Mr. Musk is trying to cure a degenerative corporate disease: systemic paralysis. Symptoms include cobwebs of corporate hierarchies with unclear reporting lines and unwieldy teams, along with work groups and positions that have opaque or nonsensical mandates. Paralyzed companies are often led by a career CEO who builds or maintains a level of bureaucracy that leads to declines in innovation, competitive stature and shareholder value.
Mr. Musk set his new tone immediately. He eliminated a 12-member team responsible for artificial-intelligence ethics in machine learning, the entire corporate communications department, and a headquarters commissary that cost $13 million a year (despite prior management's pandemic decree that Twitter employees would be ""remote forever"").
Three attributes give Mr. Musk a better chance of rebuilding Twitter into an innovative force in social media: He is an operator, an engineer and a sole owner.
As an operator, he knows he doesn't need five layers between him and the employees who actually do the work. His recent email to the engineering team stating, ""Anyone who actually writes software, please report to the 10th floor at 2 pm today,"" makes it clear he doesn't want a membrane of corporate yes-men between him and the people who actually build things.
As an engineer himself, he will command respect and loyalty from certain existing and new engineers, and he won't be jollied into agreeing to cushy timelines or accepting flippant rejections of his product requests that have merit.
As sole owner, he can also quickly terminate the members of Twitter's black hole of middle management, that cold and lonely place where great ideas go to die at big companies.
These mission-critical qualifications will enable the company to innovate and speed product development while liberating employees to get things done, unburdened by unnecessary bureaucracy.
Redundant managers, along with managers who have opaque responsibilities, are in essence professional critics. Kenneth Tynan said, ""A critic is a man who knows the way, but can't drive the car."" While corporate execs typically can't drive the car, they do have a time-tested path to success at big companies: Don't do anything. Simply critique others' attempts to do something. Don't initiate any projects that have any risk of failure or embarrassment. And always stay close enough for credit but far enough from blame. That's the road map for job security, but not for innovation.
By eliminating layers of management and proactively asking executives who prefer the warm womb of corporate indecision to leave and bringing in tested and trusted engineers and executives loyal to him, Mr. Musk will be able to move fast, get things done, and eliminate corporate waste.
Like it or not, he is establishing a new corporate culture at Twitter. It's a culture that is little known to the generation brought up on Zoom. The days of nap pods, emotional-support dogs, corporate pronoun guides, personal wellness days and email blackouts after 5 p.m. are quickly vanishing.
This new culture at Twitter will embrace speed, contribution transparency, revenue acceleration and reduction of corporate overhead. Those employees who relish getting things done will thrive. This blueprint didn't originate with Mr. Musk. It's the old 1980s ""live to work"" culture rather than the 2020s ""live to woke"" culture of Twitter's previous regime.
Twitter's success isn't guaranteed. Mr. Musk may become bored trying to fix his new electric train set and find another one. He may come to believe that Tesla's recent $400 billion-plus loss of market capitalization is due to the market's view of his shift in focus to Twitter. Or perhaps his use of the service as his personal bullhorn will ultimately alienate too many advertisers and too many of the blue-checkmark brigade.
Still, the only road to guaranteed failure would have been for Mr. Musk to leave the old corporate culture of Twitter alone. He simply can't. He has to reverse Twitter's big-tech atrophy and force the status quo to lose its status.

488,11-Dec-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Twitter's Advertising Truth Hurts; Elon Musk is leading with narrative at Twitter. Don't lose sight of the dollars and sense.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2748975712/BFD812D457A14912PQ/529?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk is probably telling the truth about advertising pressure on Twitter—but not all of it.
Mr. Musk's vague tweets on the subject have Twitter-watchers in a tither. This might not be such a bad thing: Recall Mr. Musk's 2019 Tesla Cybertruck demonstration , in which a metal ball was thrown at the truck's supposedly tough windows, only to smash them on public display. Seemingly every entrepreneur's nightmare, the failure hardly discouraged Mr. Musk. He later tweeted that the Cybertruck received hundreds of thousands of preorders for the model following the demonstration.
Mr. Musk seems to have learned a lesson from that experience as he now airs Twitter's dirty laundry with tweets about the platform's dire circumstances—like that it was losing "" $4M/day "" at some ambiguous point in time before his staff cuts—without much in the way of hard data. On Nov. 28, he tweeted that Apple Inc. had "" mostly stopped advertising on Twitter ,"" adding: ""Do they hate free speech in America?""
If you believe all press is good press, the drama may at least have brought more eyes to the platform, as Mr. Musk has reported . Indeed there is evidence to show people will follow controversy, whether they enjoy it or not.
Danah Boyd, partner researcher at Microsoft Research, spent years studying the failure of old-school social platforms Myspace and Friendster in the 2000s. She found that users will generally follow what she calls ""emotionally sticky nodes"" wherever they go. Some people go to social media to connect with friends, but many are there because they can't quit the horror show.
Mr. Musk ""appears convinced that capitalistic interests will win out,"" she wrote in a recent blog post, noting that the advertising community always seems to come back when users linger.
But first, Twitter must endure. Cue Mr. Musk's latest tweets suggesting things are improving. He regularly writes that Twitter is seeing record usage. And last weekend, Mr. Musk even thanked advertisers for returning to the platform, suggesting that perhaps the worst was over.
In a recent Twitter Spaces conversation, Mr. Musk said Apple had ""fully resumed"" advertising, but it wasn't clear whether they ever fully stopped. Despite reports to the contrary, several outlets including Platformer and Bloomberg are now reporting that Amazon may have paused some campaigns recently but never fully stopped advertising, either.
A Wall Street Journal report earlier in December suggested Twitter is essentially offering its ads at half price this month, matching up to $1 million for advertisers who book at least $500,000 in incremental spending. For some context, Meta Platforms saw its ad prices fall just 18% last quarter from a year earlier.
Earlier this month the New York Times reported that as of October, Twitter's roster of advertisers had fallen nearly 42% since May. Similarweb's data paint an even worse picture: Activity on Twitter's ad manager, a subdomain of Twitter's ad platform sites that specifically hosts those creating or monitoring ad campaigns, declined nearly 74% in October from a year earlier, according to the firm's data. In November, visits fell 85% on the same basis—the largest ad traffic decline since Twitter's change of hands.
Worryingly, even Twitter's aggressive incentives might not be helping. Similarweb's latest data show that for the first few days of December, the platform's ad manager domain traffic trends have continued to decline with traffic volume now so low it doesn't even meet the firm's threshold necessary to track and measure it. A Twitter representative couldn't be reached for comment.
In what was already a weak ad market, it doesn't seem like competitors are benefiting much from Twitter's woes. Internet holding company IAC reported disappointing November monthly metrics for its ad-based publishing business on Thursday. ByteDance's TikTok reportedly slashed its ad targets in recent months, and earlier this month Pinterest said it would cut its recruiting staff and slow hiring.
Meta last month laid off 11,000 employees, while Snap laid off 20% of its staff in August. Snap, in particular, hasn't been shy this year about mid-quarter updates when relevant; lately it's been crickets.
But that will be little consolation to Twitter stakeholders such as its creditors. In fact, it just adds to the urgency of competing for a shrinking pool of ad dollars. Mr. Musk's show may be entertaining, but someone still has to pay for the production.

 Twitter's Advertising Truth Hurts

489,11-Dec-22,San Francisco Examiner,Is Twitter hosting a watch party for its own downfall?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2754421804/BFD812D457A14912PQ/639?accountid=13946,"Headnote
Platform offers play-by-play of Musk's management style - and its consequences

Examiner staff writer
As Twitter's management devolves into chaos, the platform is hosting a screening party to its own demise. If the company wants to start seeing ad revenue go up - billionaire CEO Elon Musk obsessively tweets about nailing contracts - it may want to reach out to Orville Redenbacher's.
This week alone, the platform has provided a play-by-play of Musk's hasty, aggressive management style - and its consequences.
Three members of Twitter's Trust & Safety Council resigned, stating in a post on the platform ""contrary to claims by Elon Musk, the safety and wellbeing of Twitter's users are the on decline.""
Twitter's janitorial staff on Monday set up a picket line outside the company's headquarters on Market Street. NBC 11 reported that Musk's company slashed its union custodial contractor, seemingly overnight, resulting in 48 people without jobs, just as the holidays roll around.
The picketers made their point alongside of Scabby, a giant inflatable rat, to protest their presumed replacement with non-union contractors. It is not yet clear whom Musk intends to hire in their place.
Alan Marling, who has claimed responsibility for the Musk-centered insults being projected on the facade of the building, hopped back on Twitter just to voice solidarity with the janitors.
That same day, Forbes reported Twitter had violated building codes at its 1355 Market St. headquarters by converting offices to makeshift sleeping quarters.
A Twitter user filed a complaint with San Francisco 311, which referred the issue to the S.F Department of Building Inspection. The department has confirmed that they are investigating the issue.
Musk has been a bastion of the hardcore work ethic he's hoping to promote around the office. In a now-deleted tweet from Nov. 14, the CEO claimed he'd be sleeping at headquarters until the organization was back in working order - whatever that might mean to him.
Musk did not take kindly to the hullabaloo spurred from his converting offices to bedrooms and potentially violating city code. The CEO fired back on Twitter at Mayor London Breed with a reply that read ""So city of SF attacks companies providing beds for tired employees instead of making sure kids are safe from fentanyl. Where are your priorities @London-Breed!?"" and linked to recent reporting from the San Francisco Chronicle that detailed an account of a child allegedly accidentally overdosing on fentanyl at a park.
Axios later reported that Supervisor Aaron Peskin has called for the Board of Supervisors to hold a hearing on the matter of slumber parties and bedrooms at Twitter's headquarters.
""(Elon) is welcome to stay,"" Peskin told Axios. ""I have dealt with my fair share of ornery, testosterone-poisoned techbros. But if he wants to keep his headquarters in San Francisco, he's got to play by our rules. And those include adhering to our public safety codes and our labor laws. If he doesn't want to do that and wants to move to Texas, don't let the door hit him in the butt.""
In 2021, Musk moved Tesla's headquarters from Silicon Valley to Austin.

490,13-Dec-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Tesla Investors Voice Concern Over Elon Musk's Focus on Twitter; Supporters of Tesla and Musk are asking questions about who is running the electric-vehicle maker,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2753685653/BFD812D457A14912PQ/7?accountid=13946,"The chorus of Tesla Inc. individual investors expressing misgivings that Chief Executive Elon Musk's involvement with Twitter Inc. may be to the detriment of the electric-vehicle maker is getting louder, with the car company's stock on track for its worst full-year performance.
""There is no TSLA CEO today,"" Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund LLC, which owns roughly $50 million worth of Tesla, tweeted Monday.
Mr. Black voiced frustration after another sharp selloff in Tesla's stock Monday. Shares in the world's largest car company by market value fell more than 6% in Monday trading after a tumultuous weekend for Mr. Musk on Twitter , including the billionaire taking aim at the company's former head of trust and safety; calling for the prosecution of top U.S. government medical adviser Anthony Fauci; and criticizing people who offer their pronouns without being asked.
Mr. Black said, ""The market voted today that the $TSLA brand has been negatively impacted by the Twitter drama. Where before EV buyers were proud to drive their Teslas to their friends or show off Teslas in their driveways, now the Twitter controversy is hurting Tesla's brand equity.""
Ross Gerber, a longtime backer of Tesla, on Monday tweeted a question directed at Tesla's board of directors. ""Who is running tesla day to day during this critical time for the company,"" Mr. Gerber said.
He separately tweeted, ""There is nothing wrong at tesla at all. Other than the CEO working at another company, certainly tesla deserves a focused ceo. It would be helpful to know what Elon's plans are.""
Mr. Musk, at a trial about his Tesla compensation package last month, said he had been spending most of his time of late focusing on Twitter , which he acquired for $44 billion. ""I expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time,"" he testified.
Tesla shares are down 54.31% this year through Tuesday's close, putting it on pace for their worst year on record. The only other year where the shares fell was in 2016, when Tesla's stock ended down 10.97%. The Nasdaq, which advanced Tuesday, has fallen around 28% this year.

Tesla shares closed down 4.09% Tuesday, the day Mr. Musk ceded the unofficial title to European mogul Bernard Arnault for the world's wealthiest individual , according to Bloomberg, which publishes a ranking of the richest people.
Mr. Musk's takeover of Twitter has raised anxiety among Tesla backers for months. Several urged the Tesla CEO to abandon the deal and focus on the car maker, when shares were already down around 30%. The stock has declined further in ensuing months amid growing recession concerns and cost pressure from high inflation. Tesla also has scaled back vehicle delivery plans. Tesla's stock has fallen about 28% since the Twitter deal closed in late October through Tuesday, when it ended trading at its lowest level in more than two years.
The Tesla boss on Tuesday tweeted: ""Tesla will be great long-term, but doesn't control macroeconomic tides.""
Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. Mr. Musk last week said he continues to work on Tesla as well as SpaceX, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp. ""I continue to oversee both Tesla & SpaceX, but the teams there are so good that often little is needed from me,"" he tweeted Saturday.
Bill Nelson, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's administrator, said Sunday that he had asked SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell if Mr. Musk's purchase of the social-media platform would divert from the rocket company's mission . Mr. Nelson said he was given assurance that wouldn't be the case.
Leo KoGuan, a self-proclaimed Tesla investor, last week tweeted: ""Tesla board is missing in action"" and called on the company to initiate a share buyback. Mr. Black also has been urging the company to pursue a $10 billion share repurchase.
Mr. Musk in October said Tesla could pursue a $5 billion to $10 billion share buyback and said some meaningful buyback was likely. The company had discussed such a share repurchase at the board level, but at the time hadn't signed off on it. Mr. Musk has sold more than $19 billion in Tesla stock this year , including almost $4 billion in November to help finance Twitter.
Tesla's brand image has taken a hit in recent months, according to market surveys. Self-identifying Democrats in particular have soured on the car maker since Mr. Musk bought Twitter, according to data from research firm Morning Consult.

491,13-Dec-22,Barron's (Online),Musk Loses Crown as World's Richest Person. It's About Tesla Stock.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2753699903/BFD812D457A14912PQ/122?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk has lost his spot as the world's richest human , but Tesla shareholders are the ones who are suffering.
On Monday, Musk dropped from first to second place on the list of the world's richest humans. He fell behind LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton (MC. France) CEO Bernard Arnault as shares of Tesla continued to drop in response to concern that Musk's tweets and efforts to overhaul Twitter are damaging the electric-vehicle company's brand.
That means arresting the slide means changing Musk's behavior on his social media platform.
Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped 6.3% to start the week, finishing Monday's trading session at $167.82. The drop cut roughly $8 billion off Musk's wealth, according to Barron's calculations, putting his net worth at about $$180 billion.
 Forbes pegged Arnault's worth at about $190 billion through the close on Monday.
Inflation data disclosed Tuesday morning should have helped Musk and Tesla stock, but early gains soon faded away. The U.S. consumer price index for November increased 7.1% from a year earlier, better than the 7.3% economists were expecting.
The overall market took off on hope that the Federal Reserve might be winning its battle against inflation, which would allow it to ease up on the aggressive interest-rate increases that have hammered stocks this year. Tesla stock started the day higher, trading to almost $175 a share, but then retreated to about $164 for a loss of 2.4%.
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 1.8% and 1%, respectively.
Accounting for Tesla stock and SpaceX, Musk is worth a little less than $180 billion, still trailing Arnault. That is even though a new $140 billion valuation for SpaceX, up about 12%, added a few billion to Musk's wealth.
(Tracking wealth is more art than science. Little is known about personal liabilities, cash balances, and the precise stakes held in private companies.)
The actual place on the list doesn't matter as much as the direction of Tesla stock. Coming into Tuesday trading, shares were down about 25% since Musk took over Twitter, underperforming the Nasdaq Composite by about 28 percentage points. The drop cost Musk nearly $40 billion in net worth.
Future Fund Active ETF (FFND) co-founder Gary Black took to Twitter on Tuesday, commenting that the Twitter situation dragging down Tesla shares is similar to what happened when the EV company bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin in early 2021. Tesla shares slid from roughly $290 to under $200.
Black briefly exited his Tesla position over the Bitcoin buy, adding it back after he was convinced that the EV maker wouldn't be acquiring more of the cryptocurrency.
He isn't selling Tesla this time, saying he believes Musk ""will come to his senses that attacking his woke left customer base is hurting the [Tesla] brand and he will tone down his political views."" Black also expects Musk to name a new CEO for Twitter soon.
Both moves would be positive for Tesla stock, and Musk's wealth. A move back to the levels before Musk bought Twitter would put Tesla shares at about $225 and Musk's wealth at about $230 billion.
That wealth would put Musk comfortably ahead of Arnault.

(Still a nice nest egg, of course.)Musk now holds the number two spot on the list, behind French billionaire Bernard Arnault, the chairman and CEO of LVMH, the French luxury conglomerate that owns Louis Vuitton, Sephora, Dior, and Tiffany & Co., among many other brands.Musk spent $44 billion to acquire Twitter in a messy and contentious deal this year. But his recent tumble from the number one spot can be attributed to a different Musk-owned company: Tesla.With concerns over supply chain and demand issues rattling investors, the electric car manufacturing company's stock has plummeted in 2022, and closed down 6.3 percent on Monday.According to Matt Durot, the Forbes analyst who initially broke the news of Musk's drop in the rankings, Tesla investors may be further put off by the billionaire's Twitter antics.“Musk sold $19.3 billion of Tesla stock to finance his acquisition and many Tesla investors view Twitter as a disruptive distraction,” Durot said in a statement. “Supply chain issues have also weighed on Tesla's stock. Meanwhile, shares of French luxury conglomerate LVMH, which account for the bulk of the new No. 1 Bernard Arnault's fortune, are basically flat this year.”The timing of Musk's wealth drop also coincides with his controversial Twitter acquisition. Since taking over, Musk has laid off more than half the company's workforce, reinstated Twitter accounts that were previously suspended, and fired off multiple controversial tweets. Now, Musk and Twitter have launched a new version of the Twitter Blue subscription service, which will cost users $11 a month if they choose to subscribe through an iPhone or iPad, according to NPR. Hours later, the company disbanded its Trust and Safety Council.The success of a subscription Twitter Blue or a Tesla stock rebound could put Musk back on top of the billionaires list — he reclaimed the top spot last week after being briefly dethroned last Wednesday — but for now, he sits firmly in second."

Tesla stock started the day higher, trading to almost $175, but then retreated, closing down more than 4%, at just under $161, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1%.
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively.
Accounting for Tesla stock and SpaceX, Musk is worth a little more than $180 billion, still trailing Arnault. That is even though a new $140 billion valuation for SpaceX, up about 12%, added a few billion to Musk's wealth in recent days.
(Tracking wealth is more art than science. Little is known about personal liabilities, cash balances, and the precise stakes held in private companies.)
The actual place on the list doesn't matter as much as the direction of Tesla stock. Coming into Tuesday trading, shares were down about more than 28% since Musk took over Twitter, underperforming the Nasdaq by about 33 percentage points. The drop cost Musk more than $45 billion in net worth.
Future Fund Active ETF (FFND) co-founder Gary Black took to Twitter on Tuesday, commenting that the Twitter situation dragging down Tesla shares is similar to what happened when the EV company bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin in early 2021. Tesla shares slid from roughly $290 to under $200.
Black briefly exited his Tesla position over the Bitcoin buy, adding it back after he was convinced that the EV maker wouldn't be acquiring more of the cryptocurrency.
He isn't selling Tesla this time, saying he believes Musk ""will come to his senses that attacking his woke left customer base is hurting the [Tesla] brand and he will tone down his political views."" Black also expects Musk to name a new CEO for Twitter soon.
Both moves would be positive for Tesla stock, and Musk's wealth. A move back to the levels before Musk bought Twitter would put Tesla shares at about $225 and Musk's wealth at about $230 billion.
That would put Musk comfortably ahead of Arnault. Of course, if Tesla stock keeps sliding, Musk could be caught by other mega billionaires. Forbes puts Indian industrialist Gautam Adani at number three on its list of richest people, with an estimated net worth of about $133 billion. Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos is fourth with about $116 billion.
Tesla stock would have to drop below $105 for Musk to fall below Adani. At about $81 a share, Musk would be passed by Bezos—if nothing else changed.
Investors are likely more worried about the impact on their portfolios instead of Musk's position on the list.
To reach $105 and $81, Tesla stock would have to fall another 35% and 50%, respectively. Twitter is one thing, but double-digit drops in that range would require something bad to happen to the overall market.
At roughly $74 a share, Tesla would lose its crown as world's most valuable auto maker to Toyota Motor (TM). That, again, assumes nothing material happens to Toyota stock.

494,14-Dec-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",SpaceX Offers Employee Stock To Boost Value --- Company reached worth of $125 billion during a fundraising round earlier this year,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2753959145/BFD812D457A14912PQ/574?accountid=13946,"SpaceX is offering to sell employee-owned shares at a higher valuation than its last private funding round, people familiar with the matter said, a sign of conviction when a market rout has tanked the value of other U.S. startups.
The Elon Musk-led space exploration company has started to market employee stock for sale, offering to sell the shares at $77 each, which would value the company at around $140 billion, the people said.
The company doesn't plan to use the current offering to provide SpaceX with fresh funds that it could use for various projects. Rather, the sale effort would give employees the opportunity to monetize their holdings.
SpaceX periodically allows current and former staffers the chance to sell shares, providing liquidity for a stock that doesn't trade publicly, former employees have said. Those events suggest an overall value of the company.
A spokesman for Space Exploration Technologies Corp., as the Hawthorne, Calif., SpaceX is called formally, didn't respond to a request for comment. Bloomberg earlier reported on the offering.
Founded by Mr. Musk 20 years ago, SpaceX doesn't publicly report its financial results as a closely held company. It has raised funds from outside investors for years, bringing in $10.7 billion as of the end of last June, according to PitchBook.
SpaceX, for example, boosted its valuation to around $125 billion after bringing in new funds this year. The company later disclosed in securities filings that it has raised a total of about $2 billion in 2022.
In 2018, SpaceX worked on a fundraising round that was then designed to value the company at $30.5 billion, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.
SpaceX has developed a significant business handling rocket launches for government clients, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and for commercial-satellite operators.
It also runs Starlink, its own broadband-satellite fleet, a business unit that has increased its subscriber count this year. More recently, the company launched a division that aims to win contracts to deliver satellite-related capabilities for national-security agencies.
Space-industry analysts say the company is investing substantial sums in its Starship rocket- development program and to build out Starlink.
Mr. Musk said last year that SpaceX was likely to invest at least $5 billion and perhaps as much as $10 billion in Starlink before it fully began generating cash, with investments after that.
In addition to overseeing SpaceX, Mr. Musk is chief executive at Tesla Inc. and is involved in startups. He also recently acquired Twitter Inc.
Rick Tumlinson, founder of SpaceFund, a firm that has a position in SpaceX, said in a tweet on Tuesday addressed to Mr. Musk that the only thing the entrepreneur will be remembered for years from now is, ""Did you open the Solar System to humanity or not? Period.""
Mr. Musk responded to him by saying that social media in general and especially Twitter were ""eroding civilization.""
In the tweet, he added: ""If civilization collapses before Mars becomes self-sustaining, then nothing else matters.""

495,15-Dec-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Musk Sells $3.5 Billion Worth Of Tesla Shares,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2754374638/BFD812D457A14912PQ/98?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk sold more than $3.5 billion worth of Tesla Inc. stock this week in his second round of sales since buying Twitter Inc.
Mr. Musk sold nearly 22 million Tesla shares over a three-day period ending Wednesday, according to a regulatory disclosure.
This week's sales mean the Tesla chief executive has sold more than $39 billion in Tesla shares since the company's stock peaked in November 2021. Tesla, still the world's most valued auto maker by value, has lost more than $700 billion in market capitalization since that record.
It wasn't clear what prompted Mr. Musk to sell additional Tesla stock, and the company didn't respond to a request for comment. On Tuesday, however, Mr. Musk tweeted, ""At risk of stating obvious, beware of debt in turbulent macroeconomic conditions, especially when Fed keeps raising rates.""
Mr. Musk's ownership of Twitter, which the billionaire bought in a deal valued at $44 billion in October, has gotten off to a tumultuous start. Last month, Mr. Musk said Twitter had suffered ""a massive drop in revenue"" and was losing $4 million a day. He later invoked the specter of bankruptcy.
As part of the acquisition, Twitter took on around $13 billion in debt. That could leave the social-media company owing annual interest payments of more than $1 billion, analysts have estimated, compared with around $51 million in 2021.
Mr. Musk's focus on Twitter has irritated some Tesla investors as the company tracks for its worst annual stock-price performance on record.
Tesla shares closed down 2.6% Wednesday at $156.80, the lowest level in more than two years. The company's stock-price decline of around 55% in 2022 has eclipsed that of the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, which has fallen roughly 29% year to date.
It has also weighed on Mr. Musk's personal wealth, which has declined by more than $100 billion this year to around $160 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. On Tuesday, Mr. Musk ceded the unofficial title of world's richest person to European mogul Bernard Arnault.
The Tesla CEO previously sold company stock in April, August and November of this year, linking the latter two batches of sales to Twitter. This month's sales leave Mr. Musk owning 13.4% of Tesla, meaning he remains the company's largest shareholder by far.
Still, selling stock could weaken his control over Tesla, which has a single class of shares. Companies including Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. have multiple classes of shares, giving founders supervoting power over common shareholders.
Mr. Musk doesn't accept a salary from Tesla and instead is compensated with stock awards. He also has used his Tesla holdings as collateral to secure personal debt.
In addition to this year's sales, Mr. Musk sold more than $16 billion of Tesla shares in November and December 2021. Much of that was earmarked to cover taxes associated with exercising vested stock options that would have expired this year.

Tesla Investors don't like it, as shares continue to drop.
The Tesla (ticker: TSLA) CEO sold another $3.6 billion in Tesla stock according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed Wednesday evening.
The reason for the sales isn't clear, but were probably Twitter related .
Musk has tweeted about declining ad revenue on at his social media platform that he bought in late October. The sales might be intended to shore up finances at Twitter which weren't great even before he took over.
Musk and Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on the reason for recent sales.
Musk sold about 22 million shares in 29 separate transactions this week worth roughly $3.6 billion, bringing the total amount of Tesla stock sales to roughly $23 billion in 2022. Musk still owns about 424 million shares of Tesla, excluding his management stock options.
Investors don't like management stock sales because sales can signal weakness ahead for any stock. That isn't always the case with Tesla shares. Musk still owns a lot of stock and sells for idiosyncratic reasons. Still, his sales generate stock volatility and investors don't like volatility. What's more, investors never know exactly what his plans for sales are, creating discomfort for even long-term Tesla shareholders.
""The Twitter nightmare continues,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a Thursday report. ""As Musk uses Tesla as his own ATM machine to keep funding the red ink at Twitter which gets worse by the day as more advertisers flee the platform with controversy increasing driven by Musk.""
Coming into Thursday trading, Tesla stock was down more than 12% for the week. Musk's selling could have added to the weakness that, before sales were disclosed, was being blamed on everything from Twitter to supply/demand problems in the electric vehicle market. ""Investors are concerned about demand, pricing, auto-GMs and Twitter distraction/overhang/impact on TSLA brand,"" RBC analyst Joseph Spak writes. ""These are valid concerns and a necessary recalibration of expectations could weigh on the stock near-term.""
Spak and Ives both rate Tesla shares Buy. Ives's price target is $250 a share. Spak cut his price target to $225 from $325 on Thursday.
Shares might end up rising Thursday on the revelation that Musk himself was responsible for some of the weekly weakness. Still, it looks like investors will have to learn to live with the Musk-Twitter-Tesla overhang for some time. Tesla stock was down 2% in premarket trading Thursday. S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are 1% and 0.7%, respectively.
Coming into Thursday trading, Tesla stock is down about 55% year to date. The stock has dropped about 30% since Musk took over Twitter and underperformed the Nasdaq Composite by about 34% over that span.
Tesla stock closed down 2.6% Wednesday, closing at a new 52-week low of $156.80. The S&P 500 and Dow finished down 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively.

Huh - staff, AP

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Shares of Tesla rose slightly Thursday despite news that CEO Elon Musk sold another $3.58 billion worth of the electric vehicle maker’s stock this week.
The stock closed at $157.67, up less than 1% but still close to its two-year lows. Tesla did fare better than the broader U.S. stock market, where concerns about rising interest rates led to a 2.5% drop in the S&P 500 index.
Musk, the new owner of Twitter, sold the Tesla shares from Monday through Wednesday, according to a filing posted Wednesday night with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It wasn't clear where the proceeds of the sales were being spent.
Musk has sold nearly $23 billion worth of Tesla stock since April, with much of the money likely going to help fund his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter. Early last month, he sold nearly $4 billion worth of Tesla shares, according to regulatory filings.
The sale comes as shares of the electric vehicle and solar panel maker have collapsed, losing over half their value since Musk first disclosed in April that he was buying up Twitter stock.
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a client note that Musk seems to be changing the Tesla narrative from the fundamental electric vehicle transformation story to becoming a source of funds to finance his Twitter acquisition.
“The Twitter nightmare continues as Musk uses Tesla as his own ATM machine to keep funding the red ink at Twitter which gets worse by the day as more advertisers flee the platform with controversy increasingly driven by Musk,” Ives wrote.
The falling shares of Tesla have bumped Musk from his status as the world's wealthiest person, with his net worth falling to $174 billion, according to Forbes. He was passed last week by French fashion and cosmetics magnate Bernard Arnault. Most of Musk’s wealth is tied up in shares of Tesla Inc., which is based in Austin, Texas.
The takeover of San Francisco-based Twitter has not been smooth, and some big companies have halted advertising on the social media platform. Musk has said that Twitter had “a massive drop in revenue"" due to the advertiser losses.
Investors have been punishing Tesla stock of late while Musk has spent much of his time running Twitter, raising concerns that he's distracted from the car company.
Just this week Twitter dissolved its Trust and Safety Council, the advisory group of around 100 independent civil, human rights and other organizations that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech, child exploitation, suicide, self-harm and other problems on the platform.
A message was left with Tesla seeking comment on the stock sale."
498,15-Dec-22,Barron's (Online),It's Not Wrong to Take Fed Forecasts With a Grain of Salt,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2754466177/BFD812D457A14912PQ/258?accountid=13946,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell provided a reality check for anyone thinking the fight against inflation is close to over.
At least that's what he was probably trying to do.
Stocks rose before the decision, fell after it, and then returned to about breakeven as Powell spoke. The S&P 500 finished the day down about 0.6% and futures fell further early Thursday.
Powell didn't exactly mince his words. After unveiling projections for higher interest rates next year along with a weaker economy, he vowed not to consider rate cuts until inflation is moving toward 2% ""in a sustained way."" He said he wants a ""restrictive stance"" and warned that ""historical experience cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy.""
That seemed harsh when the headline inflation rate has fallen significantly for two consecutive months. And Powell is tying himself into ever-bigger knots trying to maintain that the Fed hikes may not lead to a recession, while also saying there's a world of pain ahead.
To be sure, central bankers are perfectly capable of lifting rates even if the outlook for growth is poor. Just look at the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, which have set out plans to raise interest rates even as their own forecasts show their economies are already contracting.
Having said that, it's by no means crazy to bet the Fed won't have to be as tough as it thinks it will to get inflation back down. After all, at this time last year Powell's predictions for the path of interest rates in 2022 weren't particularly accurate.

The Fed Still Expects More Economic Pain in 2023
The Federal Reserve's half-percentage point hike wasn't a surprise on Wednesday. Investors focused on data from its so-called dot plot and comments by Chairman Jerome Powell foreseeing higher interest rates for longer, stickier inflation, and a weaker economy.
* Before the decision, futures markets anticipated interest-rate cuts in the second half of next year, which isn't what the Fed signaled. ""I wouldn't see us considering rate cuts until the committee is confident that inflation is moving down to 2% in a sustained way,"" Powell said. ""That's the test.""
* The median forecast of the 19 policy-making members calls for the peak federal-funds rate in 2023 to hit 5.1%, compared with September's forecast of 4.6%. Their forecast for real gross domestic product growth in 2023 is now 0.5%, and they see unemployment rising to 4.6%.
* November's 7.1% rise in the consumer price index was the smallest annual change since December 2021, raising hopes that inflation was on a sustainable path lower. But Fed officials expect they will need to inflict greater economic pain to get to their target, dashing hopes of a pause or pivot.
* Powell noted that goods inflation was coming down and that housing and shelter inflation was beginning to slow but that services inflation, driven by wages, could stay elevated. The Fed wants to see a softer labor market to declare victory in its inflation fight.
What's Next: Powell and other officials have pointed to a ""higher for longer"" rate environment. The committee's median fed-funds rate estimates for 2024 and 2025 rose to 4.1% and 3.1%, respectively. They continue to see a longer-run fed-funds rate of 2.5%.

Elon Musk Sells More Tesla Stock
Elon Musk sold another $3.6 billion in Tesla stock, according to a filing late Wednesday. The slide in the electric-vehicle maker's share price is raising the pressure on Musk, who has vowed that shareholders will benefit from his acquisition of Twitter in the long term.
* Musk sold about 22 million shares in 29 separate transactions this week, bringing the total amount of Tesla stock sales to roughly $19 billion in 2022. Musk still owns about 424 million shares of Tesla, excluding his management stock options.
* Tesla's shares fell 2.6% on Wednesday to another 52-week low. They are down more than 28% since Musk closed his purchase of Twitter. Tesla closed with a market value below $500 billion for the first time since November 23, 2020. The stock pointed lower early Thursday.
* Even long-time fans are skeptical about his promise over Twitter. Ross Gerber, a Tesla backer, tweeted: ""We want our CEO back…"" Gerber, the head of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth Management, has suggested Tesla's board should appoint an interim CEO.
* Future Fund Active ETF co-founder Gary Black said on Twitter he believes Musk will realize that attacking his left-leaning customer base is hurting Tesla's brand. Black expects Musk to name a new Twitter CEO soon and resume being Tesla's full-time CEO.
What's Next: Because of Tesla's stock decline, Musk isn't the world's richest person, falling behind LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton CEO Bernard Arnault. Forbes pegged Arnault's fortune at about $190 billion through Monday's close, while Musk has a little more than $180 billion.

SEC Proposes New Rules for Wall Street's Market Makers
Wall Street is likely to push back on proposed rules by the Securities and Exchange Commission that could reduce the influence of high-speed market makers in the stock market and try to achieve the agency's goal to get better pricing for retail investors' buy and sell orders.
* Firms such as Virtu Financial and Citadel now receive and handle the majority of small orders from brokerages such as Charles Schwab and Morgan Stanley's E-Trade. The SEC wants these orders handled in an auction instead, where all of Wall Street would compete for them.
* The theory is investors would get better prices in a competitive auction. The proposal applies to orders of less than $200,000 in size at the current market price, from investors who make fewer than 40 trades a day. The SEC estimates $1.5 billion in savings for investors annually.
* Right now market makers handle most orders by matching them against other orders internally, or trading against them, rather than executing them on an exchange. The proposal says these firms, called wholesalers, could skip an auction if they could provide a better price.
* The SEC also proposed pricing changes . On exchanges, stocks are quoted in penny increments, but wholesalers can trade at narrower intervals. The SEC proposes to let exchanges quote prices and execute trades from one-tenth of a penny to a penny. Wholesalers would have to trade in the same increments.
What's Next: The SEC isn't stopping wholesalers paying brokers for order flow, something Chairman Gary Gensler has criticized in the past. But it is proposing to require brokers such as Robinhood and Schwab to report customer execution quality. The comment period on the proposals likely extends into next year.

Verizon Wants to Boost Its Streaming Hub With Free Netflix
Verizon Communications is offering some customers a free year of Netflix's premium streaming tier if they subscribe to another streaming platform offered on its new +play marketplace. Verizon joins other companies such as Apple in trying to be the middleman between viewers and streaming platforms.
* Verizon's streaming hub includes platforms such as the National Football League's NFL+ Premium; the National Basketball League's NBA League Pass; the Calm meditation app; the Peloton workout app; the Duolingo language-learning app; and AMC+, the main streaming platform of AMC Networks.
* The exploding popularity of streaming services has multiplied the number of logins, bills, payment systems, and costs that users must manage. A recent J.D. Power survey found that 60% of U.S. households had at least four streaming services, up from 40% two years ago.
* Amazon.com, Apple, and Alphabet's YouTube also offer marketplaces for households' streaming-subscription purchases, and typically earn a cut of subscription sales or ad revenue from the platforms, The Wall Street Journal reported .
* Walt Disney bundles its streaming services Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu. Paramount Global is offering its Paramount+ streaming platform to people who subscribe to Walmart's membership program. Verizon's +play marketplace also offers Disney+ and Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO Max.
What's Next: Verizon plans to expand the Netflix deal beyond an initial 30 million customers to more subscribers over time, as well as explore new kinds of streaming bundles through +play, including packages of video and non-video streaming services, the Journal reported.

Chinese Economic Data Disappoint as Covid-19 Bites
November, a month dominated by China's zero-Covid policy amid renewed outbreaks of the coronavirus, was disappointing for the world's second largest economy.
* Retail sales of consumer goods fell 5.9% in November compared with a year earlier, China's National Bureau of Statistics said Thursday, the sharpest decline since May and below the economist consensus for a 3.7% drop.
* Industrial production rose 2.2%, also missing expectationsfor a 3.6% jump, and slowing from a 5% gain in October.
* If the coming Lunar New Year allows people to visit families for the first time in a couple of years, without a catastrophic rise in deaths and strains on hospitals, Andrew Mattock, who manages Matthews Asia's China strategy, expects a boost to consumer confidence —and spending.
* Spending may not be as robust as in the aftermath of past slowdowns, says Alejandra Grindal, senior international economist for Ned Davis Research. He notes that zero-Covid, combined with a property slump and a crackdown on the internet sector, has contributed to the 20% unemployment rate for young Chinese.
What's Next: China has shifted away from its zero-Covid strategy in recent weeks but the data from November highlight the damage already done to the economy, and the long road ahead to recovery.

That suggests he either plans to buy back some of Twitter's billions in debt -- including the $13 billion it took on as part of his takeover -- or, perhaps less likely, buy back some of the company's shares.None of this will reassure Tesla shareholders, who are fretting over the roughly 61 percent drop in the carmaker's stock price from its peak in late 2021 -- and a chief executive who has admitted to spending nearly all of his time at Twitter nowadays. On Wednesday, Leo KoGuan, one of Tesla's biggest individual investors, said on Twitter, ""Tesla needs and deserves to have working full-time C.E.O.""The slump in Tesla's stock is a sharp break from the days when its ascent lit up the stock market and gave the company a market value of well over $1 trillion. This year, the stock has not only lagged the wider market but also more established automakers that are competing more aggressively with Tesla in the fast-growing electric vehicle business. Some investors and analysts are concerned that the competitive challenges Tesla faces are coming at a time when Mr. Musk appears to not only be distracted but also possibly selling Tesla shares to shore up his purchase of Twitter.Tesla stock closed up 0.6 percent, to $157.67, on Thursday after falling for three straight days. Adjusting for a stock split, the shares briefly traded at more than $400 in late 2021.""The Twitter nightmare continues as Musk uses Tesla as his own A.T.M. machine to keep funding the red ink at Twitter,"" Dan Ives, a stock analyst at Wedbush, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Some investors are also worried that Mr. Musk's divisive and incendiary statements on Twitter could be damaging Tesla's brand and putting off customers, especially people who are buying electric cars to reduce the emissions responsible for climate change.Some corporate boards will intervene if a chief executive appears to be distracted or overly focused on other ventures, but Tesla's directors, some of them longtime friends of Mr. Musk, have been widely criticized by corporate governance experts for doing little to admonish or restrain him.At the same time, Mr. Musk has been busy suspending accounts at Twitter. Most notable among them was @ElonJet, the brainchild of Jack Sweeney, a 20-year-old college student who drew on public data to track Musk's private jet.The move signifies a shift in Mr. Musk's approach to Mr. Sweeney, after the billionaire -- a self-proclaimed free-speech absolutist -- initially pledged not to suspend the @ElonJets account. Twitter justified suspending the accounts based on a change in its rules that appears to have been put in place in the last 24 hours.A new poll suggests some chief executives remain wary of what Mr. Musk is doing at Twitter. At the invitation-only Yale C.E.O. Summit held this week, attendees were asked to weigh in on top business topics. Here's where those leaders came down on some of them:56 percent of respondents said companies should stop advertising on Twitter (though a majority later said their own companies had not).69 percent said they believed Twitter's best days were behind it, while 79 percent said Mr. Musk had become a detriment to the value of his companies.PhotographElon Musk This article appeared in print on page B6."
500,16-Dec-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla Investors Want More Than Elon Musk. They're Asking for a New CEO.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2754875660/BFD812D457A14912PQ/123?accountid=13946,"There is a growing chorus among Tesla bulls saying that if Elon Musk is busy at Twitter, then the car company's board of directors should be looking to have someone else at the wheel.
It seems incredible that Tesla (ticker: TSLA) investors would want Musk's role diminished at his car company, given that the stock is up 450% since the end of 2019. But shares are also down about 60% from their record of more than $400, and are off about 55% so far this year. Those declines have wiped out almost $800 billion in market capitalization.
Earlier in the month, Musk suggested on Twitter that a weakening economy is to blame for the decline. Investors aren't so sure.
They see two main issues. First is the possibility that running the social media company will take time away from operating Tesla, not to mention the other businesses Musk manages. The second is that his actions as Twitter's CEO, plus his increasingly political tweets, will damage Tesla's brand .
""Elon blaming [Tesla] decline on macro is disingenuous,"" wrote Future Fund Active ETF (FFND) co-founder Gary Black on Twitter ""There's a piece that's due to macro. But vast majority is self-inflicted.""
He has a point. Tesla stock is down roughly 30% since he took over his social media platform. The Nasdaq Composite is flat over the same span.
Black doesn't think a change is needed at Tesla. Instead, he'd like Musk to hire a CEO for Twitter and turn his attention back to his car company. Dozens of other tweets from people who say they own the auto stock go further, calling for a new CEO, either permanently or on a temporary basis.
Tesla's third-largest individual shareholder, Leo KoGuan , is among those asking for a permanent successor. ""Elon was the proud father,"" wrote KoGuan in a tweet on Wednesday. ""Tesla has grown up, an executioner, Tim Cook-like is needed, not Elon.""
Someone running Tesla other than Musk is as difficult to picture as someone running Apple (AAPL) other than Steve Jobs, but that transition was a success. Apple stock has grown roughly tenfold since Cook took the reins in the middle of 2011.
It doesn't always go that well when founders leave. When Jobs left Apple at the behest of the board of directors in 1985, the stock languished for more than a decade.
Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. Efforts to reach board chair Robyn Denholm; Kimbal Musk, the Tesla CEO's brother and a board member; and the billionaire himself weren't immediately successful.,
Tesla shareholder and Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management CEO Ross Gerber pointed out in a recent tweet that Musk's space company, SpaceX, has a strong leader besides Musk: Gwynne Shotwell . She is there to interface with customers, such as NASA, as well as with employees when issues emerge.
""If the [board] of Tesla made an announcement on what's happening with Tesla leadership. Someone should be interim CEO. The stock decline would end,"" tweeted Gerber on Tuesday. ""It's that simple.""
The board needs ""to clarify what the plan is,"" Gerber tells Barron's.
An interim leader seems like a good balance for the Tesla board to consider. That would acknowledge Musk's continuing role at the company while giving shareholders an additional source of authoritative information about what is going on at the business.
It is rare for investors to hear anything from someone at Tesla other than from Musk. CFO Zachary Kirkhorn and engineering chief Drew Baglino are probably the only other two senior executives that most investors can name at the company.
Information is critical, given what is happening in the auto industry. EV competition is ramping up just as the economy is weakening. U.S. car buyers will be getting new tax credits for buying EVs while Chinese car buyers will be losing some purchase incentives. And all that is happening while Tesla increases production at two new assembly plants, prepares to ship the new Cybertruck , and thinks about where to put its fifth car assembly facility.
It isn't an easy scenario to manage.
Tesla stock was down 4.3% lower on Friday, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 1.6% and 1.5%, respectively. Coming into Friday trading, Tesla stock was off about 12% so far this week.

 Tesla Investors Want More Than Elon Musk. They're Asking for a New CEO.

501,16-Dec-22,The Washington Post,Investors ask Musk: Twitter or Tesla?,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2754659732/BFD812D457A14912PQ/164?accountid=13946,"In the middle of an audio chat in part discussing the future of Twitter, CEO Elon Musk said he had to drop off.
""I have a Tesla meeting that I'm late for,"" he said on the Twitter Spaces chat Tuesday, which more than 300,000 people tuned in to.
His abrupt departure is illustrative of concerns now dogging the new Twitter owner after his purchase of the company for $44 billion in late October. Helming the social media company has consumed much of Musk's schedule over the past several weeks; he has appeared on multiple audio chats and tweeted photos working from the company's San Francisco headquarters.
Now, some Tesla investors are calling for Musk to hand over the reins at one of his companies as the electric vehicle company's stock plummets - raising concerns that the billionaire is stretched too thin. Tesla closed Wednesday at $156.80 per share, with an overall valuation of less than $500 billion, sharply down from when Musk signaled his interest in Twitter over the spring and Tesla was valued at over $1 trillion.
Contributing to the losses, Musk sold about $3.5 billion worth of Tesla stock in recent days, according to a financial filing Wednesday night. That added to another more than $3.9 billion in Tesla shares sold by Musk in early November, according to the filings.
Shares of Tesla rose less than 1 percent during trading Thursday as the broader markets fell.
""Wake up tesla [board] - what is the plan? Who is running tesla and when is Elon coming back?"" tweeted Ross Gerber, a Tesla investor who supported Musk's Twitter bid.
He added in a tweet late Wednesday that Tesla needed to buy back shares ""to take advantage [of] the low share price Elon has created,"" as investors anticipated a potential further blow to the company's value on Thursday.
Musk did not respond to a request for comment. Tesla and Twitter did not respond to requests for comment.
Musk tweeted in a reply to another post Tuesday that ""I will make sure Tesla shareholders benefit from Twitter long-term.""
There is a view among some investors that Musk's recent stock sales might be the last big batch he sells, said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.
""But my view was it's wishful thinking because it's the boy who cried wolf again and again,"" he said, pointing to Musk's many Tesla stock sales this year.
Musk's bid to buy Twitter has been controversial with Tesla investors since he first announced the plan this spring. The billionaire holds much of his wealth in Tesla shares, and it was immediately apparent he would have to leverage his position there to afford his purchase of the social media company. Tesla's stock fell, but many investors remained cautiously optimistic, or at least neutral, about Musk's deal.
Investors cite their belief in Musk, including what they perceive as his relentless work ethic and ability to extract the most out of his employees. Musk has touted sleeping on the floor of the Tesla factory during a critical period when the company was struggling with production.
Musk also brought that ethos to Twitter. Early into his tenure, a photo showed an employee using a sleeping bag on the office floor, along with a tweet using the hashtag #SleepWhereYouWork. Musk demanded that employees commit to an ""extremely hardcore"" Twitter or accept severance packages, effectively laying off those who did not agree to the new ethos.
In his brief time as owner and chief executive of the company, Musk has gutted Twitter's workforce, disbanded an outside trust and safety council designed to help keep the site safe for users, and welcomed back previously banned accounts, including that of former president Donald Trump.
Since he took over in October, Musk has faced questions about how long Twitter will continue to impose such heavy demands on his time. He has said he will eventually reduce his time at Twitter and find someone else to run it.
Tesla has acknowledged in financial filings that Musk is occupied with his various business ventures, citing it as a risk to the business.
""We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer,"" the company has said. ""Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla.""
Already for some Tesla investors, it's adding up to be too much Twitter and not enough focus on Austin-based Tesla.
""We're in literally the best part of the company's history and it's being totally demolished by Twitter,"" Gerber said in an interview. ""I think the stock would rally big-time if they just said 'Elon's not CEO of Tesla anymore.' Now I don't want that. What I want is him back in Austin.'""
Gary Black, managing partner of Future Fund LLC, a Tesla investor, called on the Tesla board to pressure Musk to find a leader for Twitter so he can refocus his energies on the electric vehicle company.
""He will realize soon (if not already) that his polarizing political views are hurting customer perceptions of [Tesla] EVs,"" he wrote in a tweet. ""Customers don't want their cars to be controversial. They want to be proud as hell to drive them - not embarrassed."" He expressed hope Musk could ""focus on [Tesla] as CEO.""
Tesla is facing a demand slowdown in China and rising costs of supplies to make the electric vehicles. Investors are concerned about Musk's split focus, Ives said. They had also been wary he might continue to sell Tesla stock to fund Twitter.
Not since Steve Jobs with Apple or Jack Welch with GE has there been a CEO whose name is so closely tied to his company's brand, Ives said.
""The brand of Musk is so associated with Tesla,"" he said. ""And the Twitter circus show has been a black eye for Musk and therefore a black eye for Tesla.""
Goldman Sachs lowered its price target for Tesla this week, often meaning analysts expect the stock to fall, even as it said the company ""remains well positioned for long-term growth."" But deliveries are probably going to be lower than expected, analysts wrote. They called attention to media reports that Musk's actions have made the Tesla brand more polarizing.
""We believe that Tesla's brand has significant value related to the company's leadership position in clean energy and advanced technology,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. ""Having consumer focus related to Tesla shift back to these core attributes of sustainability and technology will be important in our view if Tesla is to meet or exceed long-term investor expectations for Tesla.""
Twitter's and Tesla's futures are now tied to each other - not just through Musk's leadership, but also through his wealth.
""The more Tesla stock goes down, it ultimately puts more pressure on the ability to fund further Twitter losses,"" Ives said.
Even some of Musk's fans seem to be questioning him.
Galileo Russell, a YouTuber who focuses on Tesla and has heaped praise on Musk, criticized Musk for wading into politics.
""I think @elonmusk getting too political is a mistake,"" he wrote in a tweet.
Musk replied: ""Must be done for the future of civilization, without which nothing matters."" Another account then asked Musk where that ranked on his list of priorities.
""Number 1,"" he wrote.
Fans piled on, writing in tweets: ""Can we make Tesla #1 and woke mind virus #2?"" and ""Hope it's worth it.""
Russell, also a Tesla investor, said he is standing by Musk, despite his critical tweet on Musk's turn toward politics.
""I hold all my Tesla shares, and continue to believe Elon is the best CEO on the planet and best person to run Tesla,"" he told The Washington Post. ""Short-term shareholders are a loud minority and will be washed out. This is a healthy and normal process as financial markets across the world rationalize.""

502,17-Dec-22,Barron's (Online),The Valuation Game: SpaceX Soars as Elon Musk Slips to No. 2,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2754983730/BFD812D457A14912PQ/480?accountid=13946,"Quiet weeks are rare in Elon Musk's world. This past Monday, Bloomberg reported that Musk was raising funds for his space company, SpaceX. At $77 a share, the offer would lift Space X's valuation 12%, to $140 billion.
That valuation is large enough to power past defense and aerospace giant Lockheed Martin, which has an enterprise value, including debt, of $137 billion, and is the third most valuable defense and aerospace company in the West, after Raytheon Technologies and Boeing. Trailing Lockheed is Europe's Airbus, and Northrop Grumman.
Size, of course, isn't everything. Chinese defense companies like naval shipbuilder China Shipbuilding Industry and defense conglomerate China North Industries Group generated more revenue than Lockheed's $65 billion in 2022, according to Defense News. Both are state-owned, making valuation difficult. As for SpaceX, as a private company it doesn't disclose financials, though revenue from its roughly 60 missions and its developing Starlink satellite Wi-Fi business, should amount to a few billion dollars. SpaceX, however, is still likely losing money, hence the offering.
If SpaceX succeeds in selling the shares, Musk would be about $7 billion richer. He might need it. His losses at Twitter, plus a falling Tesla stock price, have dealt a blow to what was once the world's biggest net worth. Now, Musk's personal valuation—comprising stakes in Tesla, Twitter, SpaceX, tunneling start-up Boring, and brain-implant company Neuralink—is down 50%, to $164 billion. As Bloomberg also reported, that puts him behind LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton's Bernard Arnault, at least as of this past week.

503,17-Dec-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",They're Rooting for Musk To Show 'Em Who's Boss: [Business/Financial Desk],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2755035461/BFD812D457A14912PQ/696?accountid=13946,"Why the Twitter owner's ruthless, unsparing style has made him a hero to many bosses in Silicon Valley.It may seem obvious, to most people outside Silicon Valley, that Elon Musk's ownership of Twitter has been an unmitigated disaster.In less than two months since taking over, Mr. Musk has fired more than half of Twitter's staff, scared away many of its major advertisers, made (and unmade) a series of ill-advised changes to its verification program, angered regulators and politicians with erratic and offensive tweets, declared a short-lived war on Apple, greenlit a bizarre ""Twitter Files"" exposé, stopped paying rent on Twitter's offices, and falsely accused the company's former head of trust and safety of supporting pedophilia. His personal fortune has shrunk by billions of dollars, and he was booed at a Dave Chappelle show.It's not, by almost any measure, going well for him. And yet, one group is still firmly in Mr. Musk's corner: Bosses.In recent weeks, many tech executives, founders and investors have expressed their admiration for Mr. Musk, even as the billionaire has flailed at Twitter.Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, praised Mr. Musk at a New York Times DealBook conference late last month, calling him ""the bravest, most creative person on the planet.""Gavin Baker, a private equity investor, recently claimed that a lot of venture-funded chief executives were ""inspired by Elon.""And several partners at Andreessen Horowitz, the influential venture capital firm, have tweeted similar encomia to Mr. Musk's management style.Some of the elite cheerleading probably boils down to class solidarity, or naked financial self-interest. (Andreessen Horowitz, for example, invested $400 million in Mr. Musk's Twitter takeover.) And some of it may reflect leftover good will from Mr. Musk's successes at Tesla and SpaceX.But as I've called around to C-suite executives and influential investors in Silicon Valley over the past few weeks, I've been surprised by how many are rooting for Mr. Musk -- even if they won't admit to it publicly.Mr. Musk's defenders point out that Twitter hasn't collapsed or gone offline despite losing thousands of employees, as some critics predicted it would. They see his harsh management style as a necessary corrective, and they believe he will ultimately be rewarded for cutting costs and laying down the law.""He says the things many C.E.O.s wish they could say, and then he actually does them,"" said Roy Bahat, a venture capitalist with Bloomberg Beta.Mr. Bahat, who has criticized some of Mr. Musk's moves, characterized his Twitter tenure as a ""living natural experiment"" -- a divisive but illuminating window into what other executives might be able to get away with, if they tried.""He's giving people a lot more knowledge of what's possible,"" he said.Tech elites don't simply support Mr. Musk because they like him personally or because they agree with his anti-woke political crusades. (Although a number do.)Rather, they view him as the standard-bearer of an emergent worldview they hope catches on more broadly in Silicon Valley.The writer John Ganz has called this worldview ""bossism"" -- a belief that the people who build and run important tech companies have ceded too much power to the entitled, lazy, overly woke people who work for them and need to start clawing it back.In Mr. Ganz's telling, Silicon Valley's leading proponents of bossism -- including Mr. Musk and the financiers Marc Andreessen and Peter Thiel -- are seizing an opportunity to tug the tech industry's culture sharply to the right, taking leftist workers and worker-sympathizers down a peg while reinstating themselves and their fellow bosses to their rightful places atop the totem pole.Some Musk sympathizers do view things in such stark, politicized terms. The writer and crypto founder Antonio García Martínez, for example, has hailed Mr. Musk's Twitter takeover as ""a revolt by entrepreneurial capital"" against the ""ESG grifters"" and ""Skittles-hair people"" who populate the rank and file at companies like Twitter.But while some tech C.E.O.s might blame a sleeper cell of gender-studies majors for their problems, many of Mr. Musk's elite fans adhere to a more straightforward, business-school kind of bossism. They admire him for ruling Twitter with an iron fist and making the kinds of moves that tech executives have resisted for fear of alienating workers -- cutting jobs, stripping away perks, punishing internal dissenters, resisting diversity and inclusion efforts, and forcing employees back to the office.These bossists believe that for the past decade or so, a booming tech industry and a talent shortage forced many C.E.O.s to make unreasonable concessions. They spoiled workers with perks like lavish meals and kombucha on tap. They agreed to use workplace chat apps like Slack, which flattened office hierarchies and gave junior workers a way to directly challenge leadership. They bent over backward to give in to worker demands -- D.E.I. workshops, flexible remote work policies, company wellness days -- to keep them happy and prevent them from jumping ship to a competitor.Then, Elon Musk showed up at Twitter, and refused to do any of that. Instead of trying to ingratiate himself with Twitter's workers, Mr. Musk fired many of them and dared the rest to quit -- forcing them to attest that they were ""extremely hard core"" if they wanted to keep their jobs. He had done some of this before at his other companies. But at Twitter, he did it all out in the open, using his Twitter account as a cudgel to keep workers in line.Twitter's former leaders, steeped in the conciliatory style of boom-time management, had allowed for an atmosphere of open debate and discussion -- one of the company's core values was ""communicate fearlessly to build trust"" -- but Mr. Musk replaced that with a culture of absolute fealty. He dressed down Twitter employees in public, and fired any who dared to criticize him. He was especially dismissive of the company's diversity and inclusion efforts -- mocking an old ""Stay Woke"" T-shirt found in a Twitter closet and disbanding the company's employee resource groups (including groups for Black, L.G.B.T.Q. and female employees).For many people, Mr. Musk's moves seemed like a case study in how not to manage a company. But for some Silicon Valley elites, they were a lightning bolt -- a long-awaited answer to the question, ""What if we just treated workers ... worse?""Bosses may not agree with every move Mr. Musk makes, but many of them think he's right on the big-picture stuff. Tech companies are bloated and unproductive. Woke H.R. departments have gone too far. Workers should stop being activists and focus on doing their jobs.Mr. Musk is not the first tech leader to air these views. Companies like Coinbase, Kraken and Basecamp have all tried to limit employee activism in recent years, with debatable results. (More recently, Meta barred workers from discussing ""disruptive"" topics like abortion and gun rights on workplace forums.)What's different now is the backdrop. For the first time in nearly two decades, economic pressures have cut into the tech industry's profits and companies that once spared no expense to keep workers happy are trimming their sails and conducting layoffs. Executives with sagging stock prices are declaring themselves ""wartime C.E.O.s,"" and workers who could have credibly threatened to leave their jobs for cushier ones a year ago are now hanging on for dear life.All of this has shifted leverage away from workers and toward bosses.""When a job market loosens, the attention that management places on employee desires -- whether workplace perks or better D.E.I. -- can wane, simply because they have less need to offer those things to recruit or retain,"" said Margaret O'Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington who has written about Silicon Valley's labor culture.In other words, Mr. Musk has picked the right time to start a management revolution. Now, the question is: How many bosses will follow him into the fire?PhotographEver since Elon Musk walked into Twitter headquarters with a sink, he has gone about cutting the ranks and perks of workers. The lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan has filed suit on behalf of some of them.

504,18-Dec-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla's Elon Musk Has a Finance Lesson for Investors. They Disagree.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2755301771/BFD812D457A14912PQ/82?accountid=13946,"There is little time off for investors following Tesla these days. The weekend before Christmas is no exception. In the past couple of days, there have been more tweets about the electric-vehicle maker's management . Investors have also learned where Tesla might put its next manufacturing plant. And Elon Musk has a finance lesson for investors.
""Securities Analysis 101,"" the Tesla (ticker: TSLA) CEO tweeted out on Saturday. ""As the 'risk-free' real rate of return from Treasury Bills approaches the much riskier rate of return from stocks, the value of stocks drop. For example, if T-bills and stocks both had a 10% rate of return, everyone would just buy the former.""
Musk is right to point out that rates impact stock valuations, but as the Future Fund Active ETF's Gary Black pointed out in a tweet responding to Musk, longer-dated Treasury bonds, not short-dated Treasury bills, matter more for stock valuations. And longer-dated bond yields have been falling as investors have started to believe that the Fed's rate increases will slow inflation and the economy.
The details of ""securities analysis"" aren't what investors and Musk are really debating. What Musk and his investors are trying to do is assign blame for declines in Tesla stock. Musk wants to blame the market. Investors want Musk to acknowledge that his time spent on, and managing, Twitter are impacting Tesla's stock and brand.
Tesla stock was down about 36% from the end of 2021 until just before Musk completed his purchase of Twitter. The Nasdaq Composite was off about 31%. Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) shares were down both down roughly 35%.
But since Musk has owned Twitter, Tesla shares are down another 33%. The Nasdaq is off about 1% over the same span. GM and Ford shares are off roughly 5%.
Tesla investors appear to have good reason to be concerned about both Twitter and the market. That's bringing calls from many investors wanting Musk to name a CEO of Twitter and turn his attention back to Tesla. Investors also want Tesla's board to initiate a stock buyback to help support the share price.
Musk has tried to reassure investors about Tesla. ""Tesla is executing better than ever,"" tweeted Musk in response to a tweet from Ross Gerber , the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management and a Tesla investor. Gerber has been one of the most vocal investors advocating for some board action to help arrest Tesla's stock decline.
There is more than just the back and forth on Twitter for investors to be concerned with. Wall Street expects Tesla to deliver more than 2.3 million cars in 2024, according to FactSet. Hitting or beating that goal will likely require a new manufacturing plant. Bloomberg reported , on Friday night, that Tesla will announce a plant in northern Mexico as early as this week.
Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about its manufacturing plans.
A new plant would be a catalyst for Tesla stock, but just how much remains to be seen. A bigger catalyst would be changes at Twitter like a new CEO or less tweeting from Musk.
It's setting up to be another interesting week for Tesla stock. Shares dropped about 16% this past week. The S&P 500 dropped about 2% over the same span.

505,19-Dec-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla Stock Is Slipping. Elon Musk Could Refocus After a Twitter Poll.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2755568110/BFD812D457A14912PQ/71?accountid=13946,"Tesla investors could finally see some light at the end of the Twitter-tunnel with Elon Musk potentially leaving his role as CEO of his social-media platform after results from a poll said he should. Shares were higher in Monday morning trading before slipping.
But that doesn't mean the end of the Twitter overhang for Tesla (ticker: TSLA) shareholders, though, and one bull is hanging up his horns mainly due to Twitter.
Tesla stock was up in premarket trading and opened the day higher. Shares are down about 1.6% in midday trading. The S&P 500 is down 0.5% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is about flat.
Investors were probably hoping for a bigger bounce. The poll doesn't end the all the negative sentiment associated with Twitter.
Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch downgraded Tesla stock to Hold from Buy on Monday. He doesn't have a price target for shares. A Hold rating, in this instance, means Tesla should should keep up with the market.
The issue is less about electric-vehicle competition or the market and more about social media. Rusch sees Tesla as a leader in EV and self-driving technology, but is struggling to separate CEO Elon Musk's non-Tesla work from his Tesla-related activities.
The ""broad public backlash driven by inconsistent standards application for Twitter users, notably banning select journalists, is pushing us to the sidelines on [Tesla],"" wrote Rusch. ""Increasing negative sentiment on Twitter could linger long term, limiting its financial performance and become an ongoing overhang"" for the stock.
Some of the overhang should abate. Musk ran a poll on Twitter, asking if he should step down as Twitter CEO. The Twitter-verse voted ""Yes,"" beating the ""No"" side 57.5% to 42.5%.
Coming into Monday trading, Tesla stock is down about 57% year to date. Shares are off roughly 33% since Musk took over Twitter, while the Nasdaq Composite is down about 1% over the same span. The drop in Tesla stock, post Musk's control of Twitter, amounts to about $75 a share.
That $75 a share is, essentially, made up of three things: Stock sales by Musk, management distraction with Musk running another company and brand damage to Tesla from Musk's tweeting.
The stock sales aren't likely to stop. Musk sold roughly $3.6 billion in stock this past week, likely to help fund Twitter. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment about the sales.
Losses are piling up as advertisers leave the platform. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives estimates Twitter will lose about $4 billion in 2022. He covered Twitter stock when it was publicly traded, and still covers Tesla stock. Ives rates Tesla stock at Buy with a $250 price target.
The main source of Musk's wealth remains Tesla stock. His sales create volatility and uncertainty for investors looking to add to Tesla positions at lower levels.
 Brand damage has been a concern of Wall Street analysts other than Rusch. Goldman Sachs' Mark Delaney , Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research, and Wedbush's Dan Ives , have all written about how Musk's management of Twitter was impacting Tesla's brand with car buyers. Musk slipping into the background at Twitter will help, but Monday's stock price reaction shows that some concern remains.
Management distraction is, essentially, solved with Musk doing less at Twitter. But that is probably the least important part of the Twitter overhang that Tesla shareholders are worried about.
With Rusch's downgrade, about 60% of analysts covering Tesla stock rate shares at Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for stock in the S&P 500 is about 58%.
Wall Street had been warming up to Tesla stock in recent months. At the start of 2022, about 41% of analysts covering the company rated shares at Buy.

506,19-Dec-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk's Twitter Poll Shows Users Want Him to Step Down as CEO; After billionaire asks on social-media platform whether he should stay or go, 57.5% of respondents say he should go",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2755495404/BFD812D457A14912PQ/309?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk should step down as chief of Twitter Inc., according to a poll the billionaire orchestrated and pledged to follow, casting new uncertainty on the social-media platform after more than seven weeks of turmoil since he took it over.
More than 17 million Twitter users had voted by the time the poll on the platform closed after 6 a.m. ET, with 57.5% saying he should leave as head of the company. Mr. Musk, who in October closed a $44 billion deal for Twitter, had said when he launched the Twitter poll on Sunday that he would abide by the results .
It isn't clear who would take over leading Twitter if Mr. Musk steps aside as CEO, or what his role would be, given that he still owns the company. Most of the company's prior leadership was either fired or left after he took over .
""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Mr. Musk tweeted Sunday.
Twitter didn't respond to a question on the poll's outcome.
The billionaire's leadership at Twitter has been tumultuous and weighed on sentiment toward his other businesses, particularly car maker Tesla. Shares in the auto maker have fallen more than 56% this year, frustrating some retail investors who partly blame Mr. Musk's focus on Twitter for the decline. Mr. Musk's Twitter involvement also has dented Tesla's brand image .
Tesla shares initially advanced Monday following the suggestion that Mr. Musk would stop running Twitter, though later fell along with the broader market.
There have been questions since Mr. Musk first showed interest in buying Twitter how he would juggle running the company while also pursuing all his other endeavors.
Bill Nelson, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's administrator, this month said he had asked SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell if Twitter would divert from the rocket company's mission. ""She assured me that it would not be a distraction,"" Mr. Nelson said.
Mr. Musk said last month that he had too much work on his plate .
""I expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time,"" he testified at a trial about his Tesla pay package last month. He also said he has been spending most of his time of late focusing on Twitter. At the time , he wrote on Twitter, ""I will continue to run Twitter until it is in a strong place, which will take some time.""
The outcome of the poll adds another disruption at the top of Twitter, which has suffered waves of leadership upheaval. Co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey handed over running the company little over a year ago after a bruising battle with an activist investor. His successor, Parag Agrawal, lasted less than a year and was fired by Mr. Musk immediately after he took over the company in October. Mr. Musk also ousted several other top Twitter executives, and more have resigned since.
Mr. Musk has been the driving force at Twitter for nearly two dramatic months, with many advertisers having paused spending, resignations, and content-moderation actions that have been abrupt and controversial among many users. This past week has been another one full of twists. Twitter suspended the accounts of several journalists, prompting criticism from some lawmakers and officials before Mr. Musk said Saturday that Twitter would begin reinstating the accounts.
Earlier Sunday, Twitter made another sudden change to its content-moderation rules, saying it would no longer allow ""free promotion of certain social media platforms."" That also fueled criticism and questions, including from Mr. Dorsey, who previously endorsed Mr. Musk's takeover. ""Doesn't make sense,"" Mr. Dorsey tweeted Sunday.
Late Sunday, the tweets from @TwitterSupport and a note on the company's website announcing the policy against promoting other social-media platforms appeared to have been deleted. Twitter's head of trust and safety, Ella Irwin, said Monday that the company removed the new policy ""in response to user feedback."" Ms. Irwin said that links to other social-media sites will be allowed until Twitter determines whether or not to implement a new policy prohibiting them.
Mr. Musk, who has said he intends to make the platform a bastion of free speech, appeared to acknowledge some concerns about the recent, abrupt content policy changes. ""Going forward, there will be a vote for major policy changes. My apologies. Won't happen again,"" he tweeted shortly before posting the poll about his leadership Sunday.
Mr. Musk has warned about Twitter's financial condition, saying last month that the company had suffered ""a massive drop in revenue"" and was losing over $4 million a day. He later raised the possibility of bankruptcy.
Mr. Musk's team this past week reached out for potential fresh investment for Twitter at the same price as the original $44 billion deal, a Twitter investor said.
Some Tesla shareholders have complained that Mr. Musk's recent focus on Twitter is hurting the auto maker. This month he sold more than $3.5 billion of Tesla stock in his second round of sales since buying Twitter. It wasn't clear what prompted Mr. Musk to sell additional Tesla stock.
Democrat Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Sunday sent a letter to Tesla's board chair, Robyn Denholm, raising questions about Mr. Musk's involvement with Twitter, suggesting it could be to the detriment of the auto maker's shareholders and create conflicts of interest. The senator has sparred before with Mr. Musk .
Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment about the share sale or the senator's letter.

 Elon Musk's Twitter Poll Shows Users Want Him to Step Down as CEO 
Credit: By Alexa Corse "
507,19-Dec-22,The Times - Tribune,Elon Musk Twitter poll ends with users seeking his departure,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2755635379/BFD812D457A14912PQ/367?accountid=13946,"Millions of Twitter users asked Elon Musk to step down as the head of Twitter in a poll the billionaire created and promised to abide by. But by Monday afternoon there was no word on whether Musk would step aside or who the new leader might be.
Twitter has grown more chaotic and confusing under Musk's leadership with rapidly vacillating policies that are issued, then withdrawn or changed.
Among those voting with the “go” camp almost certainly were Tesla investors who have grown tired of the 24/7 Twitter chaos that they say has distracted the eccentric CEO from the electric car company, his main source of wealth.
Musk also used his Tesla stock to partially fund the acquisition of Twitter.
Shares of Tesla are down 35% since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58% of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.
“This has been a black eye moment for Musk and been a major overhang on Tesla’s stock, which continues to suffer in a brutal way since the Twitter soap opera began,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote Monday.
If Musk’s tenure ends, it would be a major positive for Tesla stock and a sign that Musk is “finally reading the room that has been growing frustration around this Twitter nightmare,” Ives wrote.
Musk attended the World Cup final Sunday in Qatar, where he opened the poll. Since the poll closed early Monday, Musk has been uncharacteristically silent on Twitter as he appeared to be flying back to the U.S.
Musk has taken a number of unscientific polls on substantial issues facing the social media platform, including whether to reinstate journalists that he had suspended from Twitter, which was broadly criticized in and out of media circles.
The polls have only added to a growing sense of tumult on Twitter since Musk bought the company for $44 billion, potentially leaving the future direction of the company in the hands of its users.
Among those users are people recently reinstated on the platform under Musk, people who had been banned for racist and toxic posts, or who had spread misinformation.
Since buying Twitter, Musk has presided over a dizzying series of changes that have unnerved advertisers and turned off users. He's laid off half of the workforce, axed contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors. He has dropped enforcement of COVID-19 misinformation rules and called for criminal charges against Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert.
Musk clashed with some users on multiple fronts and on Sunday, he asked Twitter users to decide if he should remain in charge, acknowledging he made a mistake in launching new restrictions that banned the mention of rival social media websites.
The results of the online survey, which lasted 12 hours, showed that 57.5% of the 17.5 million respondents wanted him to leave, while 42.5% wanted him to stay.
The poll followed just the latest significant policy change since Musk acquired Twitter in October. Twitter had announced that users will no longer be able to link to Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon and other platforms targeted for “prohibition.”
Early Monday, the tweets from Twitter’s ‘Support’ account and the Twitter blog announcing the “prohibitions” disappeared without explanation. Twitter no longer has a press office so it was not possible to ask why.
That decision had generated immediate blowback, including criticism from past defenders of Twitter's new owner. Musk then promised that he would not make any more major policy changes to Twitter without an online survey of users.
The action to block competitors was Musk's latest attempt to crack down on certain speech after he shut down a Twitter account last week that was tracking the flights of his private jet.
The banned platforms included mainstream websites such as Facebook and Instagram, and rivals Mastodon, Tribel, Nostr, Post and former President Donald Trump's Truth Social.
A growing number of Twitter users have left under Musk, or created alternative accounts on rival platforms and included those addresses in their Twitter profiles.
Musk has advocated for free speech on Twitter, but shut down the jet-tracking account, calling it a security risk. He used that to justify the decision last week to suspend the accounts of numerous journalists who cover Twitter and Musk, among them reporters working for The New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, Voice of America and other publications. Many of those accounts were restored following an online poll by Musk.
The Washington Post’s Taylor Lorenz was suspended over the weekend after requesting an interview with Musk in a tweet tagged to the Twitter owner.
Sally Buzbee, The Washington Post's executive editor, called it an “arbitrary suspension of another Post journalist” that further undermined Musk’s promise to run Twitter as a platform dedicated to free speech.
“Again, the suspension occurred with no warning, process or explanation — this time as our reporter merely sought comment from Musk for a story,” Buzbee said. By midday Sunday, Lorenz's account was restored, as was the tweet she thought had triggered her suspension.
Musk was questioned in court on Nov. 16 about how he splits his time among Tesla and his other companies, including SpaceX and Twitter. He had to testify in Delaware’s Court of Chancery over a shareholder’s challenge to Musk’s potentially $55 billion compensation plan as CEO of the electric car company.
Musk said he never wanted to be a CEO of any company, preferring to see himself as an engineer.
In public banter with Twitter followers Sunday, Musk expressed pessimism about the prospects for a new CEO, saying that person “must like pain a lot” to run a company that “has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy.”
“No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,” Musk tweeted.

508,19-Dec-22,The Washington Post,Musk says he is staking his leadership on a Twitter poll,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2755377925/BFD812D457A14912PQ/501?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk apologized and launched a poll asking whether he should step down as head of Twitter on Sunday night after the company launched a new policy that would suspend accounts linking to certain other platforms, a move that ignited massive backlash from individuals including some of Musk's own supporters. 
Musk apologized after putting the policy in place and wrote: ""Going forward, there will be a vote for major policy changes. My apologies. Won't happen again.""
He then launched a Twitter poll, surveying users on whether he should step down. Musk had abided by past polls, despite them being unscientific and unrepresentative.
""Should I step down as head of Twitter? I will abide by the results of this poll,"" he wrote. He added shortly after: ""As the saying goes, be careful what you wish, as you might get it.""
Respondents leaned heavily toward ""Yes"" in Musk's poll, indicating Musk should step down, after nearly an hour of voting: 58 percent of more than 3 million votes were in favor of him handing over the reins. The poll was set to expire Monday morning before the opening of the stock market. The value of Tesla's stock - the source of much of Musk's net worth - has recently plunged. Investors have said Musk stepping aside from Twitter would improve Tesla's outlook.
Musk's sudden reversal came after Twitter earlier in the day said it would start suspending accounts linking to ""prohibited platforms"" such as Facebook and Instagram if those accounts are ""used for the main purpose of promoting content on another social platform,"" according to the announcement Sunday.
The policy, dated this month and tweeted Sunday afternoon, said tweets promoting accounts on some sites may be removed if users urge their Twitter followers to join them elsewhere.
""At both the tweet level and the account level, we will remove any free promotion of prohibited 3rd-party social media platforms,"" the policy said. It lists several examples of such social media sites, including Facebook, Instagram and Truth Social, which former president Donald Trump co-founded.
Musk's ownership of Twitter - which he bought in October for $44 billion - has plunged the site into turmoil. He ousted the company's executives and installed a team of loyalists, laid off more than half the staff and dialed back Twitter's content moderation. He has engaged in misinformation as the site's owner and hastily rolled out new and confusing changes, courting controversy and alarming advertisers, some of whom paused their spending on the site.
His sudden and sometimes arbitrary decisions have grated on many of Twitter's core users and staff, but also some of his own supporters who pushed his ownership bid rooted in a ""free speech"" driven approach.
Already Sunday, Musk appeared to be losing the support of some who had backed his management moves at Twitter over the new policy.
George Hotz, a software developer whom Musk hired for an internship at the company after he tweeted enthusiastically about the business mogul's takeover, tweeted a link to his Instagram account Sunday night.
""If saying that is banned, this isn't somewhere I want to be anymore. That's so far from free speech,"" he wrote in a tweet.
It was a far cry from just weeks ago, when Musk issued an ultimatum to Twitter staff saying they would need to commit to an ""extremely hardcore"" pace to build the new Twitter.
""This is the attitude that builds incredible things. Let all the people who don't desire greatness leave,"" Hotz had written.
Meanwhile, Twitter users criticized the suspension of Paul Graham, who had spoken highly of Musk's leadership, but also promoted his Mastodon handle on Twitter, screenshots on the site showed.
""This is the last straw,"" he wrote, according to screenshots posted to the site. Graham's account was suspended shortly after.
That prompted hordes of users, including National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, to weigh in. ""This is a bad policy and should be reversed,"" he wrote in a tweet.
The moves put Musk on the defensive, and he appeared to respond to the backlash, a rare move for the leader of Twitter since he took over in October.
""Paul's account will be restored shortly,"" he wrote in a tweet.
Twitter has slashed most of its public relations team since Musk took over the company in October, and Musk did not respond to an emailed list of questions about the new rule earlier in the day.
Musk, the billionaire owner of Tesla and SpaceX, recently suspended and reinstated a slew of high-profile journalists who he said had violated Twitter's rules.
In the weeks since Twitter's sale was finalized, Musk has dialed back enforcement of many of the site's previous policies regarding hate speech and misinformation, while turning in some cases to unscientific polls to make decisions, like reinstating former president Donald Trump.
The new policy banning links to some other social media sites follows many prominent Twitter users promoting their alternate accounts, often expressing the opinion that staying on Twitter may become untenable as Musk overhauls the platform.
On Sunday, the company's announcement prompted debate about whether the move could create legal challenges for Twitter.
""This is the clearest declaration of weakness I've ever seen from a major US tech platform, and a transparent declaration of anticompetitive intent that a GC would set themselves on fire to prevent (if somebody had that job at Twitter),"" tweeted former Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos, using an abbreviation for ""general counsel."" He now leads the Stanford Internet Observatory, ""a research, teaching and policy program focused on abuse in information technology,"" according to its website.
In addition to linking to Facebook, Instagram and Truth Social, promoting the social media sites Mastodon, Tribel, Post and Nostr is restricted under Twitter's new policy announced earlier Sunday. Third-party link aggregators such as linktr.ee and lnk.bio are also prohibited. Listing a social media handle without a URL is not allowed.
Twitter said a first violation of this policy may range from requiring deletion of a tweet to temporarily locking an account. An account may be suspended if the violation is in the bio or account name, the company said. Subsequent breaches of the policy could lead to permanent suspension.
Twitter's abrupt suspension of several high-profile journalists last week, including one from The Washington Post, came as Musk claimed that they had shared ""basically assassination coordinates"" for him and his family - an apparent reference to tweets about the platform suspending an account using public flight data to track Musk's private plane. Twitter allowed several of the journalists to return to the platform Saturday.
Musk also temporarily suspended, and then reinstated, a second Post reporter this weekend.
""Again, the suspension occurred with no warning, process or explanation - this time as our reporter merely sought comment from Musk for a story,"" Washington Post Executive Editor Sally Buzbee said in a statement Sunday. ""Post journalists should be reinstated immediately, without arbitrary conditions.""
On Sunday, Musk was at the World Cup finale in Qatar, tweeting posts from the match.

509,20-Dec-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk's Twitter Poll Shows Users Want Him to Step Down as CEO; After billionaire asks on social-media platform whether he should stay or go, 58% of respondents say he should go",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2755658592/BFD812D457A14912PQ/302?accountid=13946,"Twitter Inc. faced new uncertainty after a majority of respondents voted in an online poll for Elon Musk to step down as chief, amid broader concerns about how the billionaire is managing his businesses.
In the 12-hour poll , which Mr. Musk initiated and which closed after 6 a.m. ET Monday, 58% of the more than 17 million Twitter users who voted said he should leave as head of Twitter. Mr. Musk had said when he launched the Twitter poll on Sunday that he would abide by the results .
The result shows how Mr. Musk's ownership of Twitter has put him in a bind . He has embroiled himself in a series of controversial statements and decisions at the social-media platform that have alienated some users and advertisers, compounding financial problems at a company he bought in a deal valued at $44 billion in late October. Meanwhile, some shareholders in Tesla Inc., which he also runs, have complained that he is distracted by Twitter at the same time the electric-vehicle maker's share price has been falling and he has been selling parts of his stake.
Mr. Musk now must find someone to take a job running Twitter that he has said no contenders seem qualified for—and even if he finds such a person, Mr. Musk would remain unavoidably involved as the company's owner.
There is little precedent for Mr. Musk relinquishing control at his major businesses, although he has a deputy at his SpaceX rocket company, where he is chief executive. With Twitter, most of the prior leadership was either fired or left after he took over.
""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Mr. Musk tweeted Sunday.
Twitter didn't respond to a question on the poll's outcome.
Mr. Musk on Monday responded to someone on Twitter who had suggested the results might have been rigged. ""Interesting,"" Mr. Musk tweeted.
Mr. Musk has warned about Twitter's financial condition, saying last month that the company had suffered ""a massive drop in revenue"" and was losing more than $4 million a day. He later raised the possibility of bankruptcy.
Irrespective of whom Mr. Musk might appoint to be the titular head of the company, his own massive financial stake in the business means he remains closely tied to stemming losses at a company that the new owner himself has said he overpaid for.
Mr. Musk's team this past week reached out for potential fresh investment for Twitter at the same price as the original $44 billion deal, a Twitter investor said.
 Some Tesla shareholders have complained that Mr. Musk's recent focus on Twitter is hurting the auto maker. This month he sold more than $3.5 billion of Tesla stock in his second round of sales since buying Twitter. It wasn't clear what prompted Mr. Musk to sell additional Tesla stock.
Meanwhile, concerns are growing that Twitter's problems might infect other parts of Mr. Musk's business empire. Oppenheimer Research cut its Tesla rating on Monday, citing Twitter. ""The combination of Twitter's unclear cash needs amid the broad public backlash driven by inconsistent standards application for Twitter users, notably banning selected journalists, is pushing us to the sidelines on TSLA,"" Oppenheimer said in a note.
The billionaire's leadership at Twitter has been tumultuous and weighed on sentiment toward his other businesses, particularly car maker Tesla. Shares in the auto maker have fallen more than 56% this year, frustrating some individual investors who partly blame Mr. Musk's focus on Twitter for the decline. Mr. Musk's Twitter involvement also has dented Tesla's brand image .
Tesla shares initially advanced on Monday after the suggestion that Mr. Musk would stop running Twitter, although they closed lower along with the broader market.
There have been questions since Mr. Musk first showed interest in buying Twitter about how he would juggle running the company while also pursuing all his other endeavors.
Bill Nelson, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's administrator, said this month he had asked SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell if Twitter would divert from the rocket company's mission. ""She assured me that it would not be a distraction,"" Mr. Nelson said. Ms. Shotwell, who has been at SpaceX about two decades, is one of the rare executives to serve for a prolonged period alongside Mr. Musk.
Mr. Musk said last month that he had too much work on his plate .
""I expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time,"" he testified at a trial about his Tesla pay package last month. He also said he has been spending most of his time of late focusing on Twitter. At the time, he wrote on Twitter , ""I will continue to run Twitter until it is in a strong place, which will take some time.""
The outcome of the poll adds another disruption at the top of Twitter, which has suffered waves of leadership upheaval. Co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey handed over running the company a little over a year ago after a bruising battle with an activist investor. His successor, Parag Agrawal, lasted less than a year and was fired by Mr. Musk immediately after he took over the company in October. Mr. Musk also ousted several other top Twitter executives, and more have left since.

That also fueled criticism and questions, including from Mr. Dorsey, who previously endorsed Mr. Musk's takeover. ""Doesn't make sense,"" Mr. Dorsey tweeted Sunday.
The policy also irked Paul Graham, a well-known venture-capital investor who called it ""the last straw"" and signaled he was decamping Twitter for rival social-media platform Mastodon. Soon after, his account was suspended, before being restored.
Late Sunday, the tweets from @TwitterSupport and a note on the company's website announcing the policy against promoting other social-media platforms appeared to have been deleted. Twitter's head of trust and safety, Ella Irwin, said Monday that the company removed the new policy ""in response to user feedback.""

""Going forward, there will be a vote for major policy changes. My apologies. Won't happen again,"" he tweeted shortly before posting the poll about his leadership Sunday.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) on Sunday sent a letter to Tesla's board chair, Robyn Denholm, suggesting that Mr. Musk's involvement with Twitter could be to the detriment of the auto maker's shareholders. The senator has battled before with Mr. Musk .
Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment about the share sale or the senator's letter.

 Elon Musk's Twitter Poll Shows Users Want Him to Step Down as CEO 
Credit: By Alexa Corse "
510,20-Dec-22,Los Angeles Times,BUSINESS; Is this my last post on Twitter boss Musk? He said he'd abide by a poll on whether he should step down as CEO. Let's hope so.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2755712137/BFD812D457A14912PQ/313?accountid=13946,"Back in the prehistoric era (2016), a small group of Times reporters and editors, including myself, met with Elon Musk at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne.
Musk mostly talked about his idea of transporting humanity to Mars as an escape route from our global-warming-beleaguered home planet. This was his big hobby horse at that time. He was low-key and ruminative, almost convincing.
It was plain that he had thought a lot, and caringly, about the issue. He handed out coffee mugs inscribed ""Occupy Mars."" People took him seriously.

Flash forward six years. The Elon Musk of today seems to be angling for the trophy of World's Biggest Jackanapes. (Choose either of the following Merriam-Webster definitions: ""an impudent or conceited fellow,"" or ""a saucy or mischievous child."")
We quite properly try to avoid psychoanalyzing prominent newsmakers. But Musk's role as owner and chief executive of Twitter seems to have a profound effect on his public behavior, and even on his patience.
On Sunday he posted one of his informal Twitter polls, asking users whether he should step down as head of Twitter and pledging, ""I will abide by the results of this poll.""
When the poll closed, the 17.5 million respondents voted ""yes,"" 57.5% to 42.5%. As of this writing, he hasn't followed through on his promise, but an hour after the poll opened, he tweeted: ""As the saying goes, be careful what you wish, as you might get it.""
He also noted that there is no post-Elon succession plan and implied that whoever took the job must be a masochist, which would come as no surprise to anyone.
Musk has often employed user polls to validate decisions he has already made. In November 2021, he asked Twitter followers to vote on whether he should sell 10% of his shares in the electric vehicle maker Tesla, the core of his personal wealth.
He promised to abide by the results, in which respondents favored the sale by about 58% to 42%. As it happens, however, he had filed disclosures prior to the poll indicating that he had already committed to selling a sizable chunk of Tesla shares.
Musk posted his resignation poll after a tough week in which he suspended a number of prominent journalists and commentators from Twitter, asserting inaccurately that they had posted real-time information about his personal whereabouts that he said could facilitate stalkers. He reinstated the accounts after running a poll that encouraged him to do so.
He then issued a ukase banning tweets promoting several rival social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and Mastodon -- the latter an increasingly popular refuge for Twitter users repelled by Musk's management.
Within a few hours, the tweet and a Twitter page announcing the policy were deleted, possibly because of the chance that the policy would breach European Union regulations for social media firms.
Musk's suggestion that he may step away from Twitter may have been prompted by the apparent effect of his adventure with the social media firm on Tesla shares.
Since Musk acquired Twitter on Oct. 27, Tesla has suffered a market beating, with shares down by nearly 33%. That's part of a longer slide from the company's stature as a high-tech darling. Tesla peaked above $381 per share in November 2021, when it was one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalization of about $1.2 trillion.
Tesla shares have fallen 60% since then, and 57% this year alone. Its market capitalization Monday hovered around $477 billion.
The shares closed down 0.2% on Monday, but in midday trading they were rising modestly, perhaps on investors' relief that by stepping down as Twitter's CEO, Musk might turn his attention back to Tesla.
That would be important because Tesla faces head winds it hasn't needed to confront for several years, notably increased competition in the electric vehicle space from legacy automakers such as Ford, General Motors, BMW and Audi. They're marching into a space that Tesla long had almost entirely to itself.
Tesla sales have apparently been slowing in recent weeks, possibly because of buyer concerns about the economy.
But commentary abounds on Twitter from Tesla owners and prospective buyers saying they would avoid the product in the future out of distaste for Musk's outspoken swing to the political far right, as reflected in many of his recent tweets and policies.
Musk's public standing may be following the trajectory of Donald Trump, another once-lionized icon who is now facing increased skepticism, even ridicule, from his onetime followers -- and whose tolerance for having his whims thwarted is extremely limited.
The deterioration of Musk's public image can be traced online, where he has become the subject of internet memes that treat him anything but politely.
One is the scene from the German film ""Downfall,"" about Hitler's last days in the bunker, that has been re-subtitled hundreds, even thousands, of times to show Hitler erupting in fury about Trump's losing the 2020 election, the Dallas Cowboys losing to Green Bay, even the ""Downfall"" parodies themselves.
In the latest iteration Hitler -- er, Musk -- goes ballistic over the deterioration of respect for Twitter since his Oct. 27 takeover of the platform, especially after his acolytes inform him that the poll he posted about resigning as Twitter CEO ""has not gone your way.""
He rants, ""All my old supporters are turning on me, and the only ones who still like me are MAGA losers, and Russians..."" (Warning: Not entirely safe for work.)
Another meme, posted Sunday on Twitter itself, is captioned ""nfl version of elons twitter deal.""
It's a clip from the final comic-opera play of Sunday's game between the New England Patriots and Las Vegas Raiders, in which Patriots running back Rhamondre Stevenson tries to evade a tackle that would end regulation time with a tie by throwing a lateral to teammate Jakobi Meyers, who laterals again -- into the hands of the Raiders' Chandler Jones, who runs the gift into the end zone for a win.
Whether Musk's stepping down as Twitter CEO could help arrest the platform's abandonment by users who once depended on it for curated debate is unknown. After all, he's not talking about selling Twitter or placing it in some sort of trust, insulating it from his personal eccentricities -- not yet.
The platform's finances are under pressure from looming debt payments and the flight of blue-chip advertisers. That could prompt Musk either to turn Twitter over to more professional management or lead him toward even more capricious policymaking in search of revenue.
Back in 2016, interviewing Musk was interesting and illuminating, even if his musings about colonizing Mars were loopy in their way. Today, following Musk is like being submerged in the right-wing id.
Still, Musk's CEO poll and his promise to abide by the result suggests that Twitter is on the verge of entering a new chapter. If it's a chapter without a mention of Elon Musk, that will come as a relief to many of its users and perhaps his own investors.
And also to this columnist, who has been an unwilling spectator at this misadventure yet one compelled to write about almost every twist and turn.
I have better things to write about, believe me. I just ... can't ... resist ... looking. ...

511,20-Dec-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk Casts Doubt on Poll Wanting Him Gone as Twitter Head; The billionaire has suggested the outcome of the vote he called might have been rigged,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2755955261/BFD812D457A14912PQ/411?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk cast fresh doubt on a Twitter poll he initiated on the future leadership of the social-media platform that ended up calling for him to hand over the top job.
Nearly 58% of the more than 17 million Twitter accounts that responded to Mr. Musk's poll by the time it closed Monday morning voted for him to step down as head of Twitter. Mr. Musk, who has used Twitter polls to validate his statements or decisions, had said when he launched this week's poll that he would abide by the results.
Mr. Musk hadn't addressed his plans for Twitter's leadership as of Tuesday late afternoon. But since the voting closed, he has engaged with several Twitter users who have raised questions about the poll outcome. On Tuesday, he suggested the vote's outcome might have been affected by automated bot accounts on the platform that Mr. Musk had said he had begun to tame since buying Twitter Inc. in late October in a deal valued at $44 billion .
Mr. Musk was reacting to a poll conducted by New York-based market-research firm HarrisX that said a majority of Twitter users in the U.S. wanted Mr. Musk to remain at the top of Twitter. The company said it had asked 1,028 adults to respond, among them 429 Twitter users, and that the poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points among the general population and 5 percentage points among Twitter users.
""Interesting. Suggest that maybe we might still have an itsy bitsy bot problem on Twitter …,"" Mr. Musk tweeted in response.
On Monday, Mr. Musk already started to seed doubt about the outcome. He engaged with two people on Twitter that separately had suggested the outcome might have been rigged, in each instance responding with ""Interesting.""
Twitter polls like the ones Mr. Musk frequently uses have never been statistically reliable, professional pollsters say. Pollsters take pains to ensure that they sample representative sets of people, among other techniques to try to maximize their accuracy. Twitter polls are open to anyone who decides to weigh in—potentially including bots.
""Typically polls like these on social-media platforms are really just an extension of the echo chamber that's created by that platform,"" said Mallory Newall, vice president at Ipsos, a global market-research and public-polling company in Washington. ""You're polling your most-active users, which is not representative of the U.S. or global population as a whole.""
Larry Rosin, president of polling firm Edison Research Inc. in Somerville, N.J., took issue with the short windows in which Mr. Musk's leadership poll was publicized and made open for people to vote. Respondents were most likely people who happened to be on Twitter when it was live, he said.
""Something like this isn't designed to represent all Twitter users or any full population,"" said Mr. Rosin. ""It's what we call in our world a 'convenience sample.' It doesn't mean it's representative of any group except for those who chose to participate.""
He added that foul play is also a possibility. ""People game this stuff,"" he said.
Nevertheless, Mr. Musk has repeatedly used Twitter's poll feature, even before taking over the company, often in a seeming effort to provide popular cover for decisions. Last year Mr. Musk embarked on a Tesla Inc. share-selling spree after asking people on Twitter in November whether he should unload stock. Mr. Musk in September had already committed to the preset trading plan , according to regulatory filings.
In November, Mr. Musk reinstated the Twitter account of former President Donald Trump, which had been suspended by the company in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Mr. Musk in May had already said he would restore the account if his deal to buy Twitter goes through.
On Monday, Mr. Musk suggested future Twitter polls might only be accessible to those paying for the platform's subscription service.

Twitter didn't respond to a request for comment on its polling process or whether Mr. Musk still planned to abide by the outcome of the voting on his leadership of the company.
The number of respondents to a poll isn't as important as the kind of people who participate, said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
""When you get a grab bag of people, they often have extreme views. They may not represent your rank-and-file Twitter user,"" he said
The more people who opt to participate in a poll—as opposed to being selected because they meet a certain criteria—the more likely the results will be skewed, added Mr. Miringoff. ""It doesn't mean the results are necessarily bogus, but they're not dependable,"" he said.
Even before the poll closed, Mr. Musk had raised the challenge of finding someone to succeed him as head of Twitter. ""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Mr. Musk tweeted Sunday. The billionaire who also runs auto maker Tesla and rocket company SpaceX last month had suggested he eventually would hand over day-to-day running of the social-media company to someone else, though that such a move wasn't immediate.
""I expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time,"" he testified at a trial about his Tesla pay package last month. He also said he has been spending most of his time of late focusing on Twitter. At the time, he wrote on Twitter, ""I will continue to run Twitter until it is in a strong place, which will take some time.""
Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist in Washington, said Mr. Musk has acted on every poll conducted so far. ""If he doesn't abide by this one, it undercuts any future poll he does,"" he said.

 Elon Musk Casts Doubt on Poll Wanting Him Gone as Twitter Head 
Credit: By Sarah E. Needleman "
512,20-Dec-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Has Gone Quiet on the Twitter CEO Search—Aside From a Cryptic Tweet,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2755761482/BFD812D457A14912PQ/441?accountid=13946,"A day and half after a poll called for Elon Musk to step down as Twitter's chief executive, the billionaire has yet to directly respond to the results.
On Tuesday, though, Musk cryptically replied to a tweet about a CNBC story that said he had begun the search for a new CEO.
CNBC, citing unnamed sources , reported that the billionaire has been looking for a replacement since before the poll. Musk replied to the report with two laughing emojis.
Elon Musk has previously said that he plans to ""find somebody else to run Twitter over time.""
A poll of Twitter users resulted in 57.5% of a total of more than 17.5 million votes saying he should step down as head of the company. When Musk launched the poll on Sunday, he said he would abide by the results.
Though Musk hasn't acknowledged the outcome of the poll directly, he has said Twitter would restrict who can vote in policy-related polls for the social-media platform. Musk responded approvingly to a tweet that said only Twitter Blue subscribers should be able to vote in policy-related polls. Twitter Blue is a new version of paid membership launched under Musk's ownership.
Twitter didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.
Musk, who also serves as chief executive of Tesla (TSLA), responded to several tweets from users which suggested, without evidence, that the poll had been influenced by ""bots,"" or automated accounts.
Whether Musk will follow up on the poll remains to be seen. He has put no timeline on the potential appointment of a new head of Twitter should he step aside and tweeted Sunday that there was ""no successor"" who could keep the platform alive.
Shares in Tesla initially rose on Monday after the indication that Mr. Musk might stop running Twitter but subsequently closed slightly down, along with the wider market. Tesla was trading 6.4% lower on Tuesday afternoon.
Blue-tick members of Twitter are those who have chosen to subscribe to the platform since Musk took over in late October. Allowing only those users to vote could imply a doubling down on the policy changes introduced since his $44 billion purchase of the company.
Those changes include controversial content-moderation policies, the suspension of some journalists and an apparently reversed ban on promoting other social-media platforms.

 Elon Musk Has Gone Quiet on the Twitter CEO Search—Aside From a Cryptic Tweet

513,20-Dec-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Needs a New Twitter CEO. It's an 'Enormous Risk' for Potential Candidates.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2755714831/BFD812D457A14912PQ/479?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk is in the market for someone to lead Twitter, but the billionaire and Tesla CEO may find filling that post as much of a challenge as running the platform himself.
The billionaire said as much on Sunday, tweeting, ""The question is not finding a CEO, the question is finding a CEO who can keep Twitter alive."" That comment came shortly after he posted a poll asking users whether he should step down as head of Twitter. The final result was 57.5% of 17.5 million users voted ""yes.""
Twitter didn't return a request for comment about the poll.
During his seven-week tenure as ""Chief Twit,"" Musk showed why the skills he leveraged to succeed at Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX didn't carry over to running a social media platform that relies on advertising dollars. He should take that lesson to heart and find an executive who does have such experience.
Since Musk took over in October, the company launched, and scrapped, new features and rules changes at a rapid pace. Twitter also dramatically reduced staffing through a mix of layoffs, firings, and voluntary departures. Users banned for hate speech and spreading misinformation were given amnesty en masse, while journalists were suspended in the course of reporting on Musk's decision to ban accounts that track private jets.
Brands pulled back on advertising spending shortly after Musk took over, as marketers expressed concerns that Musk's cuts and moderation changes could make Twitter an unsafe place to put ads. Winning back brands will be a key test if Musk wants to avoid bankruptcy for Twitter.
Wall Street, Main Street, and Twitter itself were buzzing with suggestions for what kind of leader Musk should tap. The suggestions ranged from sensible to outright unrealistic.
In an email to Barron's, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives suggested former Meta Platforms Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg or former Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer. He said both built business models in the social and tech world ""that are in rarefied air."" That said, he thinks there is a slim possibility Musk will win over either executive.
Veteran marketing executive Lou Paskalis says that it is in the best interest of Musk, users, and advertisers for Twitter to install a ""professional, competent CEO, who is empowered to ignore, Elon's whims and build back resiliency in the platform.""
He gave Barron's a list of potential fits that included Twitter alums such as former CEO Dick Costolo and former Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain. Other suggestions from Paskalis include Walt Disney and Coca-Cola Director Carolyn Everson, GroupM North America CEO Kirk McDonald, Media entrepreneur John Battelle, Integral Ad Science CEO Lisa Utzschneider, and marketing executive Antonio Lucio.
""I think the problem is, however, that all of these executives would be taking an enormous risk to their already well burnished reputations in going to work for a mercurial owner like Elon Musk,"" Paskalis said. ""They would have to have ENORMOUS incentives and ironclad guarantees that Musk would give them carte blanche to do whatever they felt was in the best interest of the business without overriding them.""
Though Musk's poll made it clear his tenure was winding down, the billionaire had already expressed that his time running Twitter was temporary. In November, when Musk said in Delaware court that he planned to eventually find a new Twitter successor, the Barron's Tech newsletter offered three suggestions: 
John Legere: The irony is Musk's best candidate may have already volunteered for the job on social media. John Legere offered to run Twitter's daily business, freeing Musk to focus on where he excels: product and technology. Legere managed one of the most successful business turnarounds in modern business history when he was the CEO of T-Mobile . Musk rejected Legere with a simple ""No."" But he should reconsider. Legere has the right skill set and marketing chops. When he was appointed to run T-Mobile, the wireless carrier was in a similar position to where Twitter is today: a second tier player with a poor reputation in a saturated market. From there, he was able to nimbly transform T-Mobile using catchy marketing, improving its core service, while navigating a complex regulatory landscape. Legere laid the groundwork for T-Mobile to become the industry leader it is today and has the experience Twitter needs to spark a revival. Kevin Systrom: Not many entrepreneurs can claim to have founded a social media platform with two billion users: Kevin Systrom is on that shortlist. And he is still looking to innovate in the space. The Instagram co-founder has said that social media was ripe for disruption and there was a huge opportunity for anyone that can figure out how to make a better content discovery system that amplifies higher-quality content. By running Twitter, Systrom would have a scaled out platform of nearly 240 million users to jump start his latest vision. Twitter's new status as a private company would give him freedom to aggressively experiment with the platform. If Musk hands over the reins, he would get someone with impeccable design taste and app experience. It would be a good match. Alexis Ohanian: The co-founder of social media site Reddit, Alexis Ohanian would be an out-of-the-box choice. Reddit already has many of the features that could make Twitter a more enjoyable user experience—including crowdsourced filtering tools like voting to surface the most substantive posts. It also has a paid premium subscription service where users get limited Reddit currency to boost posts and thereby elevate the best content on the platform. Ohanian's product knowledge on what works and doesn't work in social media would be a strong foundation to improve Twitter's feature set.
Don't like our picks? Technology journalist and commentator Kara Swisher suggested two executives that plan to leave their job next month: Salesforce co-CEO Bret Taylor and Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield. She also suggested YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki.
AI researcher and podcaster Lex Fridman has offered to take the job for free.
""You must like pain a lot,"" Musk replied. ""One catch: you have to invest your life savings in Twitter and it has been in the fast lane to bankruptcy since May. Still want the job?""
He said yes. Knowing Musk, Fridman may be the most likely candidate we have mentioned. A fear that Paskalis expressed is that Musk would tap a crony or a yes-man offering up ""tone deaf observations and simplistic views"" of the platform and advertising.
""I fear it's very unlikely that Musk will 'do the right thing,'"" Paskalis told Barron's. ""He already tweeted out that 'be careful what you wish for' tweet, which tells me that there will be some retaliatory consequence for this.""

 Elon Musk Needs a New Twitter CEO. It's an 'Enormous Risk' for Potential Candidates.

514,20-Dec-22,Daily Herald,Twitter users tell Musk in his own poll he should step down,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2755839276/BFD812D457A14912PQ/648?accountid=13946,"Twitter users tell Musk in his own poll he should step down Millions of Twitter users told Elon Musk to step down as head of Twitter in a poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by. But by Monday evening there was no word from Musk on whether he’ll step aside or who a new leader might be. Twitter has grown more chaotic and confusing under Musk’s leadership with rapidly vacillating policies that are withdrawn or altered. Many of the votes for Musk to step down likely came from Tesla investors, who have grown tired of the 24/7 Twitter chaos, which they say has distracted the eccentric CEO from the electric car company, his main source of wealth.
EU accuses Meta of antitrust breaches with classified ads The European Union on Monday accused Facebook parent Meta of breaching antitrust rules by distorting competition in the online classified ads business, the bloc’s latest maneuver to curb the power of Big Tech companies. In its complaint after an investigation launched last year, the EU’s executive commission took issue with the tech company’s tying its online classified ad business, Facebook Marketplace, to Facebook. It’s also concerned that Meta imposes unfair trading conditions on rivals ""for its own benefit."" Meta disputed the allegations.
EU member countries reach compromise on gas price cap BRUSSELS — European Union ministers on Monday finalized a long-awaited deal to implement a natural gas price cap that they hope will help households and businesses better weather excessive price surges. EU member countries failed to overcome their differences at previous emergency meetings, but several EU leaders said last week that fixing a maximum ceiling to pay for gas was likely to be achieved this time.
Panel warns FDA’s beleaguered tobacco unit lacks direction WASHINGTON — A new report criticizes the Food and Drug Administration’s efforts to oversee the tobacco industry. The report issued Monday by a group of experts faults the FDA tobacco division’s lack of clear direction and priorities. It describes the FDA’s tobacco program as ""reactive and overwhelmed,"" in its effort to oversee both traditional tobacco products and a sprawling market of largely unauthorized electronic cigarettes. The assessment comes from a panel of experts convened by the Reagan-Udall Foundation, a non-profit that works on FDA issues. The group says the FDA’s inconsistent approach to regulation is at least partially to blame for the recent rise in underage vaping. FDA chief Dr. Robert Califf commissioned the report during the summer after months of criticism of the agency’s approach to tobacco.
After talks in Brussels on Monday, the Czech presidency of the European Council, which represents member countries, said a deal had been reached. ""We have succeeded in finding an important agreement that will shield citizens from skyrocketing energy prices,"" said Jozef Sikela, the Czech minister of Industry and Trade, adding that the mechanism will steer the 27-nation clear ""from risks to security of supply and financial markets stability.""
Since it could not find a consensus on the divisive topic, the Czech presidency opted for a ""qualified majority"" as the voting rule to reach the political agreement. Under EU rules, a qualified majority requires that 55% of member countries, or 15 out of the 27, vote in favor of a proposal. Such a vote also requires that those nations represent at least 65% of the bloc’s population."
515,20-Dec-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Why Petulant Oligarchs Rule Our World: [Op-Ed],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2755712226/BFD812D457A14912PQ/692?accountid=13946,"Some years ago -- I think it was 2015 -- I got a quick lesson in how easy it is to become a horrible person. I was a featured speaker at a conference in São Paulo, Brazil, and my arrival flight was badly delayed. The organizers, worried that I would miss my slot thanks to the city's notorious traffic, arranged to have me met at the airport and flown directly to the hotel's roof by helicopter.Then, when the conference was over, there was a car waiting to take me back to the airport. And just for a minute I found myself thinking, ""What? I have to take a car?""By the way, in real life I mostly get around on the subway.Anyway, the lesson I took from my moment of pettiness was that privilege corrupts, that it very easily breeds a sense of entitlement. And surely, to paraphrase Lord Acton, enormous privilege corrupts enormously, in part because the very privileged are normally surrounded by people who would never dare tell them that they're behaving badly.That's why I'm not shocked by the spectacle of Elon Musk's reputational self-immolation. Fascinated, yes; who isn't? But when an immensely rich man, accustomed not just to getting whatever he wants but also to being a much-admired icon, finds himself not just losing his aura but becoming a subject of widespread ridicule, of course he lashes out erratically, and in so doing makes his problems even worse.The more interesting question is why we're now ruled by such people. For we're clearly living in the age of the petulant oligarch.As The Times's Kevin Roose recently pointed out, Musk still has many admirers in the technology world. They see him not as a whiny brat but as someone who understands how the world should be run -- an ideology the writer John Ganz calls bossism, a belief that the big people shouldn't have to answer to, or even face criticism from, the little people. And adherents of that ideology clearly have a lot of power, even if that power doesn't yet extend to protecting the likes of Musk from getting booed in public.But how is this possible?It's not really a surprise that technological progress and rising gross domestic product haven't created a happy, equitable society; downbeat visions of the future have been staples of both serious analysis and popular culture for as long as I can remember. But both social critics like John Kenneth Galbraith and speculative writers like William Gibson generally imagined corporatist dystopias that suppressed individuality -- not societies dominated by thin-skinned egomaniac plutocrats acting out their insecurities in public view.So what happened?Part of the answer, surely, is the sheer scale of wealth concentration at the top. Even before the Twitter fiasco, many people were comparing Elon Musk to Howard Hughes in his declining years. But Hughes's wealth, even measured in today's dollars, was trivial compared with Musk's, even after the recent plunge in Tesla stock. More generally, the best available estimates say that the top 0.00001 percent's share of total wealth today is almost 10 times what it was four decades ago. And the immense wealth of the modern super-elite has surely brought a lot of power, including the power to act childishly.Beyond that, many of the superrich, who as a class used to be mostly secretive, have become celebrities instead. The archetype of the innovator who gets rich while changing the world isn't new; it goes back at least as far as Thomas Edison. But the big fortunes made in information technology turned this narrative into a full-blown cult, with wannabe or seem-to-be Steve Jobs types everywhere you look.Indeed, the cult of the genius entrepreneur has played a large role in the rolling debacle that is crypto. Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX wasn't selling a real product nor, as far as anyone can tell, are those of his former competitors who haven't yet gone bankrupt: After all this time, nobody has come up with significant real-world uses for cryptocurrency other than money-laundering. What Bankman-Fried was selling, instead, was an image, that of the mussy-haired, scruffily dressed visionary who grasps the future in a way normies can't.Elon Musk isn't in quite the same category. His companies produce cars that actually drive and rockets that actually fly. But the sales and especially the market value of his companies surely depend at least in part on the strength of his personal brand, which he can't seem to help himself from trashing ever more with each passing day.In the end, Musk and Bankman-Fried may end up doing a public service, by tarnishing the legend of the genius entrepreneur, which has done a great deal of harm. For now, however, Musk's Twitter antics are degrading what had become a useful resource, a place some of us went for information from people who actually knew what they were talking about. And a happy ending to this story seems increasingly unlikely.Oh, and if this column gets me banned from Twitter -- or if the site simply dies from mistreatment -- you can follow some of what I'm thinking, along with the thoughts of a growing number of Twitter refugees, at Mastodon.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

516,21-Dec-22,Barron's (Online),"Musk to Abdicate at Twitter, but Tesla Still Has His Premium Priced in",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2756085327/BFD812D457A14912PQ/76?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk said he'll give up on running Twitter as soon as he finds ""someone foolish enough to take the job.""
He finally acknowledged a poll on his social media site over his leadership that, surprisingly, appeared to give him an answer he didn't want to hear .
He'll certainly need to find a new CEO with a lot of confidence. If his foray into Twitter has shown anything, it's that the job of running the company can reduce someone of Musk's impressive track record from Marvel Superhero to mere mortal in just two months.
For investors, the bigger question is what it all means for Tesla. On Tuesday evening, Musk tweeted that the carmaker's share slide comes down to higher interest rates , but that doesn't explain why the stock has tanked so much more than the rest of the market.
Yet Tesla is still priced considerably higher than other carmakers. Even after a rough year, it trades at 24 times forward earnings. BMW and Ford trade at about 6 times forward earnings, and newly listed Porsche at 17 times. That suggests that investors haven't completely given up on the man–there's still a Musk premium in Tesla shares.
Throughout his career, his great talent was convincing people that they're not just buying a share of future revenues in his companies, but rather a stake in big ideas that can change the world.
Twitter has taken a lot of the shine off, and Musk may not be able to recover it. As F. Scott Fitzgerald said, there are no second acts in American lives.
Now it's up to Musk to prove that that's just another mold he can break.

Zelensky Visits Washington as Lawmakers Boost Military Spending
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's trip to Washington on Wednesday is his first spell abroad since the Russian invasion of his country. The visit comes on the heels of lawmakers finalizing a $1.65 trillion spending bill for fiscal 2023 with boosted military funding and additional aid for Ukraine and North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies.
* A meeting with President Joe Biden is on the schedule as well as an address to a joint session of Congress. Biden is expected to confirm the provision of a Patriot antimissile battery to Ukraine, an advanced air-defense system made by Raytheon Technologies and Lockheed Martin.
* Biden isn't expected to pressure Zelensky to negotiate with Russia, according to the Wall Street Journal, despite a top U.S. general last month saying the winter could provide an opportunity for peace talks. That means no short-term relief for energy inflation worries stoked by the conflict.
* The bill presented by lawmakers includes $858 billion in military spending, up about 10% from the prior year and $45 billion more than Biden had requested. Senate Republicans presented the increase as a win in negotiations, as it breaks the prior parity between increases in defense and nondefense spending.
What's Next: The bill looks set to pass with support from Senate Republicans despite the opposition of some of their House colleagues who hoped to push negotiations into next year. Military spending is on the rise in the U.S. and its NATO allies, but aid to Ukraine could become controversial under a Republican-controlled House next year.

Wells Fargo Settles with Regulator Over Loan, Account Issues
Wells Fargo reached a $3.7 billion settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over allegations of loan and deposit account mismanagement affecting 16 million accounts. The CFPB said the bank illegally assessed fees and interest charges on auto and mortgage loans and some had cars wrongly repossessed.
* The settlement comes six years after Wells Fargo's fake account scandal came to light and other problems in its lending and deposit businesses since then. ""Wells Fargo's rinse-repeat cycle of violating the law has harmed millions of American families,"" said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra.
* The CFPB ordered Wells Fargo to pay a record $1.7 billion civil penalty and $2 billion in restitution, including $205 million for illegal surprise overdraft fees, the CFPB said. Much of the latter has been paid, a bank spokesperson said.
* Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said: ""This far-reaching agreement is an important milestone in our work to transform the operating practices at Wells Fargo and to put these issues behind us,"" adding that the bank's priority is to operate in ""a more controlled, disciplined way.""
* Since 2018, Wells Fargo has been operating under a $2 trillion asset cap imposed by the Federal Reserve in response to its fake accounts scandal. That cap has been an overhang on the stock. Wall Street wants to see enough improvements in Wells Fargo operations for it to be lifted.
What's Next: Wells Fargo set aside $2 billion for regulatory and legal issues in the third quarter, and said Tuesday it expects fourth-quarter operating losses to hit $3.5 billion because of the settlement.

FedEx Reports Softer Shipping Demand as Economy Slows
FedEx's shares rose 3.6% late Tuesday despite the transportation and delivery giant offering lower-than-expected full-year earnings guidance. Domestic and international express daily package volumes dropped about 12% from last year, while ground deliveries fell about 9%—a sign the economy is slowing down.
* FedEx posted adjusted fiscal second-quarter earnings of $3.18 a share from $22.8 billion in sales, beating Wall Street's quarterly projections for profit but falling short of sales forecasts. FedEx expects to earn $13 to $14 a share for the year, while analysts forecast $14.
* FedEx said it is facing challenges from a weakening global economy and is cutting costs to try to offset any sales weakness. Management plans to reduce expenses by about $3.7 billion this fiscal year, almost 5% of total costs incurred running the business in fiscal year 2022.
* Investors were shocked in September when FedEx announced quarterly results early, saying it earned about $3.40 a share versus expectations for $5.10 a share. Management blamed a weakening economy, and its shares plunged 21% the trading day following the warning.
* In other earnings, Nike stock rose nearly 12% in after-hours after the athletic apparel maker reported stronger than expected revenue and profit and showed signs it was getting its inventory glut under control. Executives said they remained positive about consumer demand.
What's Next: Nike expects full-year fiscal 2023 revenue will be dimmed somewhat by foreign exchange effects, but despite that its outlook is higher than before. It expects full-year revenue growth in the mid-single digit percentages, compared with earlier guidance for sales growth in the low- to mid-single digit range.

3M to Quit Forever Chemicals Business by 2025
Industrial materials giant 3M, the maker of Post-it Notes and Scotch tape, will stop making and using chemicals that take a long time to break down, also known as forever chemicals , by 2025, exiting a business that's given it headaches for years. 3M expects to take charges totaling $1.3 billion to $2.3 billion to shut down the business.
* PFAS, short for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, take a long time to break down in the environment. The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed designating PFAS and related compounds as hazardous, and requiring companies to remove them from the environment.
* 3M Chief Executive Mike Roman told The Wall Street Journal that the decision was influenced by increasing regulation of PFAS chemicals, and customers looking for alternatives to the chemical used in nonstick cookware, food packaging, and other products.
* The compounds have been found in drinking water, including municipal systems and private wells, and exposure has been linked to health problems including kidney and testicular cancers, thyroid disease, and high cholesterol, the EPA said. Thousands of lawsuits have been filed against chemical companies alleging harm from PFAS.
* 3M's net sales of PFAS chemicals represent about 4% of its total annual sales, according to RBC Capital Markets. ""This is a step in the right direction for 3M,"" RBC analysts wrote Tuesday.
What's Next: 3M expects to record a $700 million to $1 billion charge in the fourth quarter of 2022. The company said about 70% to 80% of the charges are noncash. 3M could spend up to a half a billion dollars exiting the business.

Luxury Liquor Sales Surged in the Third Quarter
Sales of premium alcohol, or spirits sold at $50 or more for a 750ml bottle, have continued to surge the trend towards quality started during the pandemic. Sales of luxury spirits rose 15% in the third quarter from one year ago, according to the Distilled Spirits Council's latest Luxury Brand Index.
* Sales of American whiskey, including such brands as Brown-Forman's Jack Daniel's and Rémy Cointreau's Westland, were strongest, rising 33% from last year. Tequila consumption rose 29%, followed by Japanese whisky, up 20%.
* The Distilled Spirits Council launched the Luxury Brand Index in October 2021, but it has historic data to 2017. Compared with five years ago, luxury spirits volume sold in the U.S. has nearly tripled. Over this time frame, tequila beat whiskey, growing 44% annually to 43% for whiskey.
* Investors shifted to wine this year as an alternative investible asset. The Liv-ex Fine Wine 1000, the broadest index of the fine wine market, is up 16.1% year over year, while the benchmark Liv-ex 100 rose 3.8%.
* There are signs of a slowdown in fine wine markets after supply chain turmoil. The Liv-ex 100 recorded its first decline in 18 months in July, and again in October and November, and trade volume increased 2.4% in 2022 compared with 10.4% last year.
What's Next: Liv-ex, a global marketplace for the fine wine trade, even uncovered some ominous signs among merchants, who said in the survey they had ""neutral"" or ""quite pessimistic"" view about next year. Two respondents predicted the Liv-ex 100 Index would fall more than 25% in 2023.

 Musk to Abdicate at Twitter, but Tesla Still Has His Premium Priced in 
"
517,21-Dec-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Tesla Bears Are Sitting on $15 Billion in Gains This Year; Reversal of fortunes for Elon Musk's company has been music to the ears of the stock's many detractors,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2756099969/BFD812D457A14912PQ/139?accountid=13946,"The Tesla Inc. bears are finally feeling somewhat vindicated.
After years of wrong-way bets, investors shorting the shares of Elon Musk's electric-vehicle maker are sitting on collective gains of $15 billion in 2022, according to data from S3 Partners.
Short sellers borrow shares and sell them with the hope of profiting by buying the stock back at a lower price later.
Tesla shares have fallen 61% in 2022, including Tuesday's 8.1% drop, dinged by the higher interest-rate environment that has sent speculative stocks tumbling back to earth. Investors have also grown increasingly concerned that Mr. Musk's attention is divided following his takeover of Twitter Inc .
The reversal of Tesla's fortunes has been music to the ears of the stock's many detractors who watched in astonishment when it kicked off a monster run in early 2020, with little regard for fundamentals.
Tesla traded around $30, on a split-adjusted basis, at the start of that year and eventually peaked above $400 in November 2021. Its valuation swelled to more than $1.2 trillion, making it one of the largest companies in the U.S. by market value. The stock closed Wednesday at $137.57, a two-year low.
""It has not been an easy road being a Tesla bear,"" said Andrew Left, the founder of Citron Research who is known for betting against stocks. ""It's been a pain-in-the-ass trade.""
Of course, many Tesla bears didn't stick around. Some were forced to call off their bets and close their positions at a loss during the precipitous rise in the company's shares. Collective mark-to-market losses on the trade were a whopping $51 billion over the course of 2020 and 2021, according to S3.
Tesla has long been among the most shorted U.S. stocks. The rapid increase in the shares during the pandemic was exacerbated in part by the many short sellers who were forced to buy back shares to close their losing positions.
Short interest in Tesla peaked at more than $51 billion in January 2021, but has fallen to average $19.3 billion in 2022, according to S3. Roughly 3% of the stock's free float is currently sold short, down from an average of 10% in 2020.
Mr. Left, who was previously burned by his short position, says he promised himself at one point that he would never trade Tesla again. This summer, though, he says he began to get ""FOMO,"" or a fear of missing out, and he jumped back in. Mr. Left said he closed his position Thursday at a profit but sees room for the shares to fall further.
""It's still an expensive stock,"" he said. ""By no means is this over. As most stock traders will tell you, things don't go from expensive to fairly priced. Things normally go from expensive to cheap.""
Tesla shares are trading at 42.5 times their earnings over the past 12 months, a far cry from their peak multiple of 1,765 from January 2021, according to FactSet. The S&P 500, in contrast, trades at 17.6 times earnings.
""People are starting to pay attention to some of the facts that they didn't want to pay attention to before. Competition. Saturation. There's a lot of factors involved that people were sweeping under the table,"" Mr. Left added.
Also hurting the stock of late are Mr. Musk's own share sales. The Tesla chief executive has sold more than $39 billion in stock since November 2021, in part to help finance his Twitter acquisition. His most recent sale was last week.
Mr. Musk tweeted late Tuesday that he would step down as Twitter's chief executive as soon as he finds a replacement.
Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Musk has previously tweeted that short sellers were ""value destroyers"" and that short sales should be illegal.
Lately, the stock has been the target of everyone from hedge-fund managers to Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates.
In a series of tweets earlier this year, Mr. Musk accused Mr. Gates of shorting $500 million in Tesla shares. Mr. Gates didn't directly answer questions about whether he was personally shorting the stock at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit in May. A representative for the Gates Foundation didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Danny Moses, the investor famous for bets against the housing market who was portrayed in the 2015 movie ""The Big Short,"" said on CNBC Thursday that he is currently short Tesla and expects it to fall further.
""It's still a $500 billion company and I don't think that the fundamentals justify that valuation,"" Mr. Moses said on ""Fast Money."" ""I think a lot of the stock price has been about his brand, and we've seen that now get hit a little bit. His attention span is being compromised.""
One group has refused to abandon Tesla despite this year's sharp share-price declines: the retail crowd. Tesla has been the most-purchased stock among U.S. retail, or nonprofessional, investors this year—dethroning Apple Inc., according to data from Vanda Research. The $15.2 billion of retail purchases is a record for Tesla.
""While purchasing across the market has softened, retail investors have continued to religiously buy into Tesla,"" said Lucas Mantle, a data science analyst at Vanda Research.
If there's one thing strategists agree on, it's the difficulty of valuing Tesla given the retail interest and Mr. Musk's cultlike following.
Australian hedge-fund manager John Hempton, founder of Bronte Capital, said his firm has a small short position in Tesla but struggles to apply its traditional criteria in evaluating the stock.
""Elon breaks our model,"" Mr. Hempton said.

518,21-Dec-22,USA Today (Online),Musk claims he will resign as Twitter CEO when he finds replacement as Tesla value plunges,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2755985077/BFD812D457A14912PQ/227?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk tweeted Tuesday he will step down as CEO of Twitter after he finds a replacement. ""I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!” Musk wrote on Twitter.  With Tesla’s market value plunging since Musk announced his plan to buy Twitter in April, pressure is increasing for Musk to tap a replacement. Shareholders are in open revolt over the time commitment and negative publicity that have come with Musk’s stewardship of Twitter. Wells Fargo settlement: CFPB orders Wells Fargo to repay $2B to customers as part of $3.7B settlement Kroger's $25B acquisition of Albertson's: Here's what could stop Kroger's takeover of Albertson's Will Elon Musk step down as Twitter CEO? CEO or not, Twitter’s new owner will still call the shots. After finding a successor, Musk tweeted that he will “just run the software & servers teams."" Musk asked Twitter users over the weekend whether he should step down as CEO of the social media platform he bought for $44 billion in October. With more than 17 million votes cast, the verdict was decisive: 57.5% of straw poll respondents said he should. CEO candidates whose names have been floated include Musk pals David Sacks, a former PayPal executive, and Jason Calcanis, a tech entrepreneur. Musk said early on that he didn’t plan to remain at the helm of Twitter and reducing his time commitment was his plan all along. “There’s an initial burst of activity needed post acquisition to reorganize the company,” Musk said in November during a trial over his compensation at Tesla. “I’d find someone else to run Twitter over time.” This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Musk claims he will resign as Twitter CEO when he finds replacement as Tesla value plunges"
519,21-Dec-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk Offers Worst Job in Tech; Twitter owner hunts for new CEO, with many strings attached",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2756218803/BFD812D457A14912PQ/255?accountid=13946,"Wanted: Chief executive officer of a flailing tech company who will have no control over that company's product or distribution. Hours: All. No free lunch. Must be willing to suffer public ridicule and disdain from the company's owner .
It is not exactly the ad that is going to light up LinkedIn. But it is basically what Elon Musk is searching for in his quest for a new ""Chief Twit."" Late Tuesday, Mr. Musk said that he will resign as CEO of the social network he bought barely two months ago ""as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" He added that he still plans to run Twitter's software and servers teams.
Elon Musk, in other words, isn't going anywhere. Finding a capable someone to take over a struggling business he has managed to impair further with a few months of erratic management would be hard enough. But as Mr. Musk himself points out, a new Twitter chief won't even have control over vital aspects of the business.
And just how bad off is Twitter's business now? In a Twitter Spaces conversation Tuesday evening, Mr. Musk claimed Twitter was on track to burn an annual $3 billion before he cut costs in a situation he likened to a high-speed plane on fire spiraling toward the ground. A sharp drop in advertising has put the company on target for about $3 billion in revenue next year—43% below Twitter's trailing 12-month revenue as of the end of June, before he completed his takeover. Mr. Musk added that Twitter has a little more than 2,000 people left, which suggests three-quarters of the company's staff members have either been laid off or quit this year.
In that context, Mr. Musk's own question is apt. What kind of a leader, skilled enough to have a fighting chance at rescuing Twitter from its depths, would be foolish enough to hang himself by Mr. Musk's puppet strings? Comforting approximately no one, Mr. Musk also said Tuesday that he now believes Twitter will be ""OK"" next year, potentially breaking even based on his recent changes.
Those changes include a launched, botched and relaunched Twitter Blue subscription program, carrying prices and features that seem in near-constant flux. Citing a software developer in Berlin, the New York Times reported last month that, as of Nov. 15, Twitter Blue had amassed just 140,000 subscribers.
Even at the new premium price of $11 a month (if you sign up on IOS) and if you generously assume Blue has, say, doubled its subscribers in the weeks since, that amounts to just under $37 million. How exactly that can help repay the $1 billion-plus in annual debt repayments raised to finance Mr. Musk's purchase of the company amid a slowing advertising business will require nothing short of a wizard to work out.
Even if Twitter manages to score the right marionette and do ""OK"" next year, the bigger question for Mr. Musk is whether Tesla will be. Back in August, after stressing the importance of avoiding an ""emergency"" sale of Tesla stock should he be forced in court to go through with his purchase of Twitter, Mr. Musk sold millions of Tesla shares days after the acquisition closed. He then sold millions more Tesla shares last week.
Tesla's stock has shed 58% of its value since the day Mr. Musk announced his intention to buy Twitter . And much of that decline has come since early October, when Mr. Musk stopped trying to get out of the Twitter deal. In a tweet, Mr. Musk essentially blamed Tesla's recent stock declines on the Federal Reserve, citing rising interest rates. But the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have only fallen 18% and 10%, respectively, since the Twitter deal was announced. Even Rivian, a money-losing, cash-burning electric-vehicle maker that barely started shipping vehicles last year and has since recalled most of them , is down only 37% in that time.
Without a publicly traded Twitter, Tesla's stock has become the best barometer of how investors feel about Mr. Musk's management of the microblogging service. Tesla shares slid 16% last week, when Twitter started banning journalists who shared publicly available information on the location of Mr. Musk's private jet, or otherwise irked him in some way. Colin Rusch of Oppenheimer downgraded Tesla to a ""perform"" rating on Monday, reasoning that ""increasing negative sentiment on Twitter could linger long term, limiting its financial performance and become an ongoing overhang on Tesla."" Mr. Musk has lost more than $100 billion in net worth this year thanks to Tesla's stock slump alone. With Twitter's fate now so tightly intertwined with Tesla's , it is near impossible to imagine a show not run by Mr. Musk, no matter his official role. Mr. Musk went to all the trouble to buy Twitter precisely to control it. Anyone who believes otherwise would be a fool, indeed.

 Elon Musk Offers Worst Job in Tech

520,21-Dec-22,Barron's (Online),Elon Musk Says He Will Step Down as Twitter CEO,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2755977001/BFD812D457A14912PQ/352?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk said Tuesday night that he would step down as Twitter's chief executive.
In a Tuesday evening tweet, Musk said ""I will resign as Twitter CEO ""as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!""
The Tesla chief added that he would run the software and server teams, even after a replacement executive is found. That caveat could make the role a tougher sell for prospective executives that want full control of the company.
A recent poll of Twitter users resulted in 57.5% of a total of more than 17.5 million votes saying Musk should step down as head of the company. When Musk launched the poll on Sunday, he said he would abide by the results.
The post was Musk's first direct acknowledgement of the poll's outcome. Earlier on Tuesday, though, Musk cryptically replied to a tweet about a CNBC story that said he had begun the search for a new CEO.
CNBC, citing unnamed sources , reported Tuesday that the billionaire has been looking for a replacement since before the poll. Musk replied to the report with two laughing emojis.
Elon Musk has previously said that he plans to ""find somebody else to run Twitter over time.""
On Monday, Musk said Twitter would restrict who can vote in policy-related polls for the social-media platform. Musk responded approvingly to a tweet that said only Twitter Blue subscribers should be able to vote in policy-related polls. Twitter Blue is a new version of paid membership launched under Musk's ownership.
Blue-tick members of Twitter are those who have chosen to subscribe to the platform since Musk took over in late October. Allowing only those users to vote could imply a doubling down on the policy changes introduced since his $44 billion purchase of the company.
Those changes include controversial content-moderation policies, the suspension of some journalists and an apparently reversed ban on promoting other social-media platforms.
Twitter didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.
Musk, who also serves as chief executive of Tesla (TSLA), responded to several tweets from users which suggested, without evidence, that the poll had been influenced by ""bots,"" or automated accounts.
Musk has put no timeline on the potential appointment of a new head of Twitter should he step aside and tweeted Sunday that there was ""no successor"" who could keep the platform alive.
Shares in Tesla initially rose on Monday after the indication that Mr. Musk might stop running Twitter but subsequently closed slightly down, along with the wider market. Tesla fell 8.5% in Tuesday trading. The confirmation he will abide by the poll could be good news for Tesla investors worried that Musk has become distracted by Twitter.

 Elon Musk Says He Will Step Down as Twitter CEO

521,21-Dec-22,Boston Globe (Online),"Musk says Twitter in precarious position, defends cost cuts",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2756375052/BFD812D457A14912PQ/398?accountid=13946,"SAN FRANCISCO — Elon Musk is defending his massive cost-cutting at Twitter as necessary for the social media platform to survive next year, due in part to debt payments tied to his $44 billion takeover of the company.“This company is like, basically, you're in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don't work,” Musk told a late-night audience on a Twitter Spaces call Tuesday.That's after Musk said earlier on Tuesday that he plans to remain Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.Musk's announcement came after millions of Twitter users asked him to step down in an online poll the billionaire himself created and promised to abide by.“I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!” Musk tweeted. “After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.”Since taking over the San Francisco social media platform in late October, Musk's run as CEO has been marked by quickly issued rules and policies that have often been withdrawn or changed soon after being made public.Musk said Tuesday night that he “spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy” and trying to build a stronger paid subscription service because otherwise Twitter might be operating with $3 billion in negative cash flow next year. He in part blamed the $12.5 billion in debt tied to his April agreement to buy the company, as well as the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate hikes.Some of Musk's actions have unnerved Twitter advertisers and turned off users. He has laid off more than half of Twitter's workforce, released contract content moderators, and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors that the company formed in 2016 to address hate speech and other problems on the platform.The Tesla CEO has also alienated investors at his electric vehicle company over concerns that Twitter is taking too much of his attention, and possibly offending loyal customers.Even more unnerving for investors, Tesla shares are plummeting.Shares of Tesla are down 35 percent since Musk took over Twitter on Oct. 27, costing investors billions. Tesla's market value was over $1.1 trillion on April 1, the last trading day before Musk disclosed he was buying up Twitter shares. The company has since lost 58 percent of its value, at a time when rival auto makers are cutting in on Tesla's dominant share of electric vehicle sales.Shares fell Wednesday, as they have every day this week.A single share of Tesla that cost about $400 to start the year, can now be had for less than $140.Musk sought to defend some of his recent Twitter decisions on the Twitter Spaces call.“They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever,” Musk said. “It's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason. Not because I'm naturally capricious. Or at least, aspirationally, I'm not naturally capricious.”Musk, who also helms the SpaceX rocket company, has previously acknowledged how difficult it will be to find someone to take over as Twitter CEO.Bantering with Twitter followers earlier this week, he said that the person replacing him “must like pain a lot” to run a company that he said has been “in the fast lane to bankruptcy.”“No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,” Musk tweeted.As things stand, Musk would still retain overwhelming influence over platform as its owner. He fired the company's board of directors soon after taking control."
522,21-Dec-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Elon Musk Says He Plans to Step Down as Twitter Head After Casting Doubt on Poll; Billionaire has suggested outcome of vote he called might have been rigged,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2755971137/BFD812D457A14912PQ/419?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk said he planned to step down as Twitter Inc. chief executive officer after casting doubt on a poll he initiated on the future leadership of the social-media platform that ended up calling for him to hand over the top job .
Nearly 58% of the more than 17 million Twitter accounts that responded to Mr. Musk's poll by the time it closed Monday morning voted for him to step down as head of Twitter. Mr. Musk, who has used Twitter polls to validate his statements or decisions, had said when he launched the poll that he would abide by the results.
Mr. Musk went about 38 hours after the poll closed without addressing his plans for Twitter's leadership, before tweeting late Tuesday that he ""will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software & servers teams.""
Mr. Musk previously said that he intended to relinquish the role as head of Twitter, but without committing to a firm timeline and suggesting on several occasions that finding someone to take the job would be hard.
After the poll results came out, he engaged with several Twitter users who raised questions about the poll outcome. At one point Tuesday, Mr. Musk suggested the vote's outcome might have been affected by automated bot accounts on the platform that Mr. Musk had said he had begun to tame since buying Twitter Inc. in late October in a deal valued at $44 billion .
Mr. Musk was reacting to a poll conducted by New York-based market-research firm HarrisX that said a majority of Twitter users in the U.S. wanted Mr. Musk to remain at the top of Twitter. The company said it had asked 1,028 adults to respond, among them 429 Twitter users, and that the poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points among the general population and 5 percentage points among Twitter users.
""Interesting. Suggest that maybe we might still have an itsy bitsy bot problem on Twitter …,"" Mr. Musk tweeted in response.
On Monday, Mr. Musk started to seed doubt about the outcome. He engaged with two people on Twitter that had separately suggested the outcome might have been rigged, in each instance responding with ""Interesting.""
Twitter polls like the ones Mr. Musk frequently uses have never been statistically reliable, according to professional pollsters. Pollsters take pains to ensure that they sample representative sets of people, among other techniques to try to maximize their accuracy. Twitter polls are open to anyone who decides to weigh in—potentially including bots.
""Typically polls like these on social-media platforms are really just an extension of the echo chamber that's created by that platform,"" said Mallory Newall, vice president at Ipsos, a global market-research and public-polling company. ""You're polling your most-active users, which is not representative of the U.S. or global population as a whole.""
Larry Rosin, president of the polling firm Edison Research Inc., took issue with the short windows in which Mr. Musk's leadership poll was publicized and made open for people to vote. Respondents were most likely people who happened to be on Twitter when it was live, he said.
""Something like this isn't designed to represent all Twitter users or any full population,"" said Mr. Rosin. ""It's what we call in our world a 'convenience sample.' It doesn't mean it's representative of any group except for those who chose to participate.""
He added that foul play is also a possibility. ""People game this stuff,"" he said.
Nevertheless, Mr. Musk has repeatedly used Twitter's poll feature, even before taking over the company, often in a seeming effort to provide popular cover for decisions. Last year Mr. Musk embarked on a Tesla Inc. share-selling spree after asking people on Twitter whether he should unload stock. Mr. Musk had already committed to the preset trading plan , according to regulatory filings.
In November, Mr. Musk reinstated the Twitter account of former President Donald Trump, which had been suspended by the company in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. Mr. Musk in May had already said he would restore the account if his deal to buy Twitter went through.
On Monday, Mr. Musk suggested future Twitter polls might only be accessible to those paying for the platform's subscription service. He launched another poll Tuesday about Congress, with the voting open to Twitter users more widely.
Twitter didn't respond to a request for comment on its polling process.
The number of respondents to a poll isn't as important as the kind of people who participate, said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.

""When you get a grab bag of people, they often have extreme views,"" he said. ""They may not represent your rank-and-file Twitter user.""
The more people who opt to participate in a poll—as opposed to being selected because they meet a certain criteria—the more likely the results will be skewed, added Mr. Miringoff. ""It doesn't mean the results are necessarily bogus, but they're not dependable,"" he said.
Even before the poll closed, Mr. Musk had raised the challenge of finding someone to succeed him as head of Twitter. ""No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,"" Mr. Musk tweeted Sunday. The billionaire, who also runs the auto maker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX, last month suggested that he eventually would hand over day-to-day running of the social-media company to someone else, though that such a move wasn't immediate.
""I expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time,"" he testified at a trial about his Tesla pay package. He also said he has been spending most of his time of late focusing on Twitter. At the time, he wrote on Twitter, ""I will continue to run Twitter until it is in a strong place, which will take some time.""
Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist in Washington, said Mr. Musk has acted on every poll conducted so far. ""If he doesn't abide by this one, it undercuts any future poll he does,"" he said.

524,21-Dec-22,Hartford Courant,It's the age of the petulant oligarch,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2756039035/BFD812D457A14912PQ/679?accountid=13946,"I think it was 2015 when I got a quick lesson in how easy it is to become a horrible person. I was a featured speaker at a conference in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and my arrival flight was delayed. The organizers, worried that I would miss my slot thanks to the city's notorious traffic, arranged to have me met at the airport and flown directly to the hotel's roof by helicopter.
Then, when the conference was over, there was a car waiting to take me back to the airport. And I found myself thinking, ""What? I have to take a car?"" By the way, in real life I mostly get around on the subway.
Anyway, the lesson I took was that privilege corrupts, that it very easily breeds a sense of entitlement. And surely, to paraphrase Lord Acton, enormous privilege corrupts enormously, in part because the very privileged are normally surrounded by people who would never dare tell them that they're behaving badly.
That's why I'm not shocked by the spectacle of Elon Musk's reputational self-immolation. When an immensely rich man, accustomed not just to getting whatever he wants but also to being a much-admired icon, finds himself not just losing his aura but becoming a subject of widespread ridicule, of course he lashes out erratically, and in so doing makes his problems even worse.
The more interesting question is why we're now ruled by such people. For we're clearly living in the age of the petulant oligarch.
It's not really a surprise that technological progress and rising gross domestic product haven't created a happy, equitable society; downbeat visions of the future have been staples of serious analysis and popular culture for as long as I can remember. But both social critics such as John Kenneth Galbraith and speculative writers such as William Gibson generally imagined corporatist dystopias that suppressed individuality - not societies dominated by thin-skinned egomaniac plutocrats acting out their insecurities in public view.
So what happened?
Part of the answer, surely, is the sheer scale of wealth concentration at the top. Even before the Twitter fiasco, many people were comparing Elon Musk to Howard Hughes in his declining years. But Hughes' wealth, even measured in today's dollars, was trivial compared with Musk's, even after the recent plunge in Tesla stock. More generally, the best available estimates say that the share of total wealth by the top 0.00001% today is almost 10 times what it was four decades ago. And the immense wealth of the modern super-elite has surely brought a lot of power, including the power to act childishly.
Beyond that, many of the superrich, who as a class used to be mostly secretive, have become celebrities instead. The archetype of the innovator who gets rich while changing the world isn't new; it goes back at least as far as Thomas Edison. But the big fortunes made in information technology turned this narrative into a full-blown cult, with wannabe or seem-to-be Steve Jobs types everywhere you look.
Indeed, the cult of the genius entrepreneur has played a large role in the rolling debacle that is crypto. Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX wasn't selling a real product nor, as far as anyone can tell, are those of his former competitors who haven't yet gone bankrupt: After all this time, nobody has come up with significant real-world uses for cryptocurrency other than money-laundering. What Bankman-Fried was selling, instead, was an image, that of the mussy-haired, scruffily dressed visionary who grasps the future in a way normies can't.
Musk isn't in quite the same category. His companies produce cars that drive and rockets that fly. But the sales and especially the market value of his companies surely depend at least in part on the strength of his personal brand, which he can't seem to help himself from trashing ever more with each passing day.
In the end, Musk and Bankman-Fried may end up doing a public service, by tarnishing the legend of the genius entrepreneur, which has done a great deal of harm. For now, however, Musk's Twitter antics are degrading what had become a useful resource, a place some of us went for information from people who actually knew what they were talking about. 
And a happy ending to this story seems increasingly unlikely.

525,22-Dec-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)",Musk's Tweets Only Aggravate Tesla's Troubles: [Correction],https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2756552812/BFD812D457A14912PQ/15?accountid=13946,"The maker of electric cars faces sharp competition, plummeting shares and production woes while its chief executive is preoccupied with Twitter.Production headaches on three continents. Intensifying competition. A plunging share price. And a distracted chief executive seemingly bent on alienating some of the company's most loyal customers.A growing list of problems at Tesla, the world's most valuable car company, is puncturing its mystique as the segment's technology leader, leading analysts and investors to question whether it can continue to dominate the market for electric vehicles.At the center of investors' concern is Elon Musk, the chief executive, whose high-profile purchase of Twitter has overshadowed his Tesla role at a critical moment in the automaker's relatively short history.Tesla is straining to ramp up production at new factories in Austin, Texas, and outside Berlin. Covid restrictions and dysfunctional supply chains, a problem for all carmakers, have led to intermittent shutdowns at Tesla's factory in Shanghai.As interest rates rise and a global recession looms, demand for Tesla vehicles appears to be slackening. Only a few months ago would-be buyers had to wait months for a new Tesla. Now the cars are available within days, which analysts see as a sign of weaker demand.Yet Mr. Musk has been preoccupied with Twitter, a company he concedes he bought at an inflated price. Last weekend he asked users of the service in a ""poll"" whether he should step down as Twitter's chief executive, saying he would abide by the results. A majority of those responding said yes.On Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he would resign as chief executive of Twitter ""as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job!"" But he also said he would continue to manage the team responsible for software and servers.Managing Tesla ""is not a part-time job in these volatile and challenging times,"" said Axel Schmidt, a senior managing director at Accenture who oversees the consulting firm's automotive division.Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. Musk remains widely admired in the auto industry for the way he proved that battery-powered vehicles could be stylish, fun to drive and profitable. Tesla's success forced car-making giants like General Motors, Ford Motor and Daimler to answer with their own electric models.Mr. Musk personifies Tesla as much as Henry Ford once personified the carmaker that bears his name. As co-founder, chief executive and largest shareholder, Mr. Musk is able to make decisions quickly and has built a big lead over traditional carmakers in battery technology and software.But it is unclear who is minding the store while Mr. Musk tries to remake Twitter. Tesla publishes no management pyramid. The company's website lists only three top executives: Mr. Musk; Zachary Kirkhorn, the chief financial officer; and Andrew Baglino, a senior vice president responsible for engineering.Mr. Musk ""has such a large personality, the impression is that the company is weak without him and that nothing happens without his approval,"" said Garrett Nelson, a senior equity research analyst at CFRA, an investment research firm. (Mr. Nelson added that he disagreed with that view.)And now that the traditional automakers are selling credible electric vehicles, Tesla no longer has the market to itself.In the United States, electric vehicles from Ford, General Motors and Hyundai have chipped away at Tesla's lead. Competition will intensify this year with the introduction of models like the Cadillac Lyriq and the Nissan Ariya.In China, Tesla faces a stiff challenge from local manufacturers like BYD, which this year stopped making internal combustion models to focus solely on electric vehicles and has surpassed Tesla in the number of cars sold.In Europe, Volkswagen and its subsidiaries like Audi already sell more electric cars than Tesla, although Tesla's Model Y and Model 3 remain the most popular all-electric vehicle models.In an industry that thrives on new products, Tesla has not introduced a new passenger car since the Model Y, a sport utility vehicle, in 2020. The company has promised to begin selling its long-awaited Cybertruck in 2023. But the pickup will arrive long after competing products from Ford, Rivian and General Motors.Tesla's share price, down 66 percent at the end of trading Wednesday from the peak in November 2021, dramatizes how swiftly investors have lost faith in both the company and Mr. Musk. On Tuesday alone, the stock fell 8 percent.The decline partly reflects fear that Mr. Musk will need to sell more chunks of his stake in Tesla to pay for his Twitter takeover. To finance his purchase of the social media site in October for $44 billion, Mr. Musk has sold Tesla stock worth $23 billion, flooding the market and driving down the price. He remains the largest shareholder in Tesla.The plummeting shares are also a sign that investors no longer believe Mr. Musk's promises that Tesla will sell 20 million cars a year by 2030, as many as Volkswagen and Toyota together. It was that dream of global dominance that justified Tesla's $1 trillion valuation. (These days Tesla is worth less than half that.) Mr. Musk suggested on Twitter on Tuesday that the shares had fallen because of rising interest rates and the threat of recession.Mr. Musk has always been a mercurial boss, but his management style has vividly been on display since he bought Twitter, where he fired or laid off more than half the staff and demanded that those who remained work ""hardcore"" hours.Chaos at Twitter has eroded Mr. Musk's reputation as a genius, and his incendiary tweets risk alienating potential buyers, who skew left. He has suggested that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's chief immunologist, be prosecuted, and accused Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, of harming America after she said he was neglecting his duty to Tesla shareholders.""There was this kind of aura around Elon Musk that he could do no wrong,"" said Taylor Ogan, a hedge fund manager and YouTube presence who has owned three Teslas. ""That has finally caught up with him.""Joya Banerjee, a lead adviser focused on gender-based violence at the humanitarian organization CARE in Washington, looked at a Tesla when she was shopping for an electric vehicle last year. But even before Mr. Musk bought Twitter, she was put off by what she perceived as his ego, sexism and excessive power.""I couldn't see my money going to his C.E.O. salary,"" she said. Ms. Banerjee bought a Ford Mustang Mach-E instead.Kenneth Holecko, a retired government human relations manager who lives in Virginia and owns a Tesla, said Mr. Musk's statements about Dr. Fauci and other topics added to concerns he had about the company's credibility on matters like safety of its autonomous driving software.""I'm not going to go out and sell my Tesla because of what's going on with Twitter,"" Mr. Holecko said, ""but I would never buy another Tesla.""Survey data indicate that Mr. Musk's behavior has hurt Tesla's brand among liberals, the group most likely to buy electric cars. Tesla's net favorability rating -- the number of people who view the company positively minus those with a negative view -- plummeted to 10 percentage points in November from 31 percentage points at the beginning of the year, according to Morning Consult, a research firm.Tesla's net favorability rating among Republicans has improved slightly, to 27 percentage points in November from 21 percentage points in August, as Mr. Musk adopted some conservative talking points, according to the firm's research. But there are unlikely to be enough new Republican Tesla fans to compensate for disaffected Democrats, said Jordan Marlatt, an analyst at Morning Consult.""Increasingly, Tesla is becoming a pretty partisan brand, and that could have pretty serious implications for Tesla in the future,"" Mr. Marlatt said.Although Tesla still dominates electric vehicle sales in Germany, it has been steadily giving ground to other manufacturers. Mr. Musk's recent activities on Twitter have been headline news across the country, with Germany's Foreign Ministry joining the European Union in condemning the deactivating of some journalists' accounts on Twitter as dangerous to press freedom.The sour mood surrounding Mr. Musk is beginning to rub off on German drivers, with a clear majority saying his takeover of Twitter has had a negative effect on Tesla's image, especially among women and among people 50 or older. Nearly half of Germans who are contemplating or actively looking to buy a new car said the Twitter takeover had turned them away from considering a Tesla, according to Puls, a market research firm in Nuremberg, Germany. The firm surveyed 1,010 people in the first weeks of December.Tesla's new factory outside Berlin produced 3,000 Model Ys last week, the company said Monday on Twitter. But that is well below targets set by Mr. Musk.Mr. Musk's behavior running Twitter has been a nonissue in China, by far the largest market for electric vehicles. Like nearly all Western social media platforms, Twitter is blocked in China.On the contrary, from the perspective of China and the Communist Party, Mr. Musk has been a model foreign executive. In October, Mr. Musk won praise from Chinese officials after suggesting that Taiwan become a special administrative zone of China as a way of ceding more control to Beijing. The comment drew a sharp rebuke from Taipei.But there are signs that the cutthroat competition in China's electric vehicle market may be taking a toll. In October, Tesla cut prices for its cars in China by up to 9 percent. The company said it was doing so because production costs had come down.Tesla's sales in China through November were 59 percent higher than a year earlier, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association, but that was slower than overall growth of ""new energy vehicles"" -- a category that includes all-electric cars and plug-in hybrids. Sales of these vehicle have doubled, while BYD, the market leader, increased its sales more than threefold.Tesla has been slower than Chinese rivals to roll out new models and features. Tesla introduced the Model 3 in China almost three years ago and the Model Y about 18 months ago. In China, that lag between new models is an eternity, and an opportunity for rivals.""The target has always been on Tesla's back, but now it's bigger because they seem weaker,"" said Tu Le, managing director of the Beijing-based consultancy Sino Auto Insights. ""The competitors smell blood.""Ryan Mac contributed reporting.Ryan Mac contributed reporting.PhotographTesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, in Berlin this year.

526,22-Dec-22,Barron's (Online),"Tesla Is the Most Profitable Short Pick of 2022, With Nearly $14 Billion in Proceeds Since Elon Musk Agreed to Buy Twitter",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2756784364/BFD812D457A14912PQ/125?accountid=13946,"Tesla shares plunged for a fifth consecutive daily of declines Thursday, adding more to short sellers' returns from betting against the electric-vehicle maker.
Tesla (ticker: TSLA) shares finished down 8.9% at $125.35, dropping as much as 11% to an intraday low of $122.26 on volume of more than 200 million shares Tuesday, compared with a 52-week average daily volume of about 81 million shares. While shares did not close under the psychological barrier of $125, Tesla still finished at its lowest price since September 2020. For the week, shares are down 16.6%, which would challenge the previous week for the worst since 2020 . Tesla stock is on the road to its worst month, quarter and year on record .
Not only was Tesla the most active and worst performing stock on the S&P 500 Index Thursday, it was also the most active and worst performing on the Nasdaq 100, according to Dow Jones data.
The decline pushed Tesla's market capitalization below $400 billion, dropping it to 10th on the list of most valuable companies in the S&P 500. Visa (V) moved higher than Tesla on Tuesday, when Tesla trading put its valuation at $395.82 billion cap, below Visa's $418.17 billion. Walmart (WMT), at $383.35 billion, was sneaking up on Tesla with a chance to knock it out of the top 10.
Short sellers, whom Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has made a point of targeting previously, are having a happy holiday if they bet against Tesla this year, S3 Partners' Managing Director of Predictive Analytics Ihor Dusaniwsky said in a note. He pointed out that Tesla has been the most profitable stock to short in 2022.
""Short sellers have been backing up their TSLA short exposure for good reason, it is the most profitable short, in dollar value, of 2022,"" Dusaniwsky said. Tesla shorts are up $15 billion year-to-date in mark-to-market profits in 2022, with a gain of $4.54 billion in December alone, according to S3 data.
""Since Elon Musk's Twitter bid on 4/14/22, TSLA shorts are up $13.74 billion in mark-to-market profits,"" Dusaniwsky said.
The analyst said short interest in Tesla has been declining since April because of the price drop, but short selling has increased since August. With 3.05% of the stock's 81.8 million shares shorted, Tesla shares at $11.28 billion are the second largest short by dollar amount behind Apple (AAPL) and its $16.78 billion in short interest.
For their part, Visa shares are also the fourth largest short by dollar value at $7.75 billion, according to S3 data.
Tesla shares were under pressure Thursday after the company doubled the discount it offers to customers who ""take delivery of a new Model 3 or Model Y between December 21 and 31, 2022 for a $7,500 credit and 10,000 miles of free Supercharging,"" according to its website, raising concern that demand in the EVs is slipping. Tesla buyers are no longer eligible for a U.S. tax credit of up to $7,500 for purchasers of electric vehicles, but that incentive could return in 2023, which could be a disincentive to purchase a Tesla in the U.S. this year.
Tesla shares are off 64.4% for the year, while the S&P 500 has fallen 19.8% and the Nasdaq Composite Index is off by a third.

 Tesla Is the Most Profitable Short Pick of 2022, With Nearly $14 Billion in Proceeds Since Elon Musk Agreed to Buy Twitter

527,22-Dec-22,Los Angeles Times,BUSINESS; A downbeat outlook for shares of Tesla; Analysts reassess their forecasts over stock's tumble and modest earnings expectations.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2756550003/BFD812D457A14912PQ/216?accountid=13946,"A year ago, Tesla seemed unbeatable, with its shares near a record high amid soaring optimism for the global electric-vehicle market. Now, investors are struggling to see a bottom.
The stock was never for the faint of heart, given its volatility and the mercurial style of its chief executive, Elon Musk. Still, the magnitude of this year's rout is staggering: It has lost more than 60% through Wednesday's close, on pace for a record annual decline, and erasing about $626 billion of shareholder value.
Two years to the day after Tesla joined the Standard & Poor's 500 index, investors are confronting a new reality. Competition from established major automakers is intensifying, threatening Tesla's dominant market share. Analysts also see little in the pipeline to reignite the sort of rabid demand for the shares seen in 2020. Meanwhile, the stock is about 40% below the level at which it joined the benchmark.

""This whole narrative about Tesla being a leader in everything they do is waning,"" said Jeffrey Osborne, an analyst at Cowen & Co. who has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock. ""Tesla shares tend to work best when you can create a feverish narrative about something coming. It is unclear what is to be excited about it in the new year.""
The company's highly anticipated driving software and its battery technology are both falling short of meeting their timelines, the analyst noted. Meanwhile, the futuristic design of its Cybertruck can make it a tough sell as a mainstream vehicle. Tesla didn't reply to an emailed request for comment.
Analysts have been scrambling to reassess their outlook given the stock's free fall, more modest earnings expectations and the overall reset in valuations of growth companies: Wall Street's average price target for Tesla has now sunk to the lowest level in more than a year.
The stock fell 8.1% on Tuesday to $137.80, its weakest since November 2020, after Evercore ISI and Mizuho Securities became the latest to slash projections. On Wednesday before closing at $137.57, it briefly fell below $136.03, the level where the shares were trading in November 2020 when S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that the stock would be included in the S&P 500 index.
Given the stock's dive, the average analyst target of about $259 -- which is a far cry from the record close of $409.97 the shares touched in November last year -- implies a roughly 90% gain over the next 12 months from Tuesday's close, suggesting there may be room for that gap to narrow.
It's a stunning reversal from a year ago, when Tesla was valued at almost $1 trillion, earnings were consistently beating expecta- tions and demand for EVs seemed poised to soar with more countries announcing green-energy policies.
""Investors are projecting a phenomenal increase in revenue numbers along with an expansion in manufacturing capacity,"" said Bruce Kahn, a portfolio manager at Shelton Capital Management, which held about 236,000 Tesla shares as of the end of September. The expectation is that sales could go from 1 million cars to 3 million, but the ""reality is, not yet.""
Of course, tech shares have suffered broadly as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to tame inflation, sparking angst over a possible recession.
Tesla shares have been among the weakest, partly because of worries that a downturn could crimp demand for costly electric vehicles. Only Meta Platforms has posted a steeper decline among the 10 NYSE FANG+ index members, which include Facebook, Amazon, Netflix Inc. and Google.
Musk's purchase of Twitter made matters worse as concern grew that his preoccupation with the social media platform was reducing his focus on Tesla. He also sold off a chunk of his shares to help finance the deal.
Yet when it comes to valuation, Tesla is still the fourth-most expensive stock on the NYSE FANG+ index, trading at a multiple of 33 times estimated 2022 earnings.
The company is worth almost $440 billion, far bigger than any other major global carmaker. Japan's Toyota Motor Corp., the second-biggest, is valued at about half that. Toyota is estimated to sell 8.9 million cars in fiscal 2023, ending March 31, and Tesla deliveries for calendar 2022 are expected to be around 1.3 million vehicles, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Granted, the bulls point to Tesla's much fatter margins.
""Tesla is still trading like a tech company, as a high-growth company, whereas other auto manufacturers are not,"" said Shelton's Kahn. ""The valuation still looks rich, because people think the EV complex will grow exponentially and Tesla will be one of the major players in it.""
To some, it all suggests there's room for the stock to fall further. Momentum certainly isn't on Tesla's side. No development has managed to buoy the shares for long in 2022, including the decision to split the stock and dangling the possibility of a share buyback. Musk's Twitter poll about stepping down as CEO of that company also failed to stem the slide. And his subsequent confirmation Tuesday that he will indeed resign from the position hasn't sparked any major relief rally.
It's a time of reckoning for Tesla investors, many of whom see Musk's ability to drive the company to success as forming the foundation for its potential. That partly explains why in a year when Tesla's earnings are expected to grow more than 80% and revenue to expand nearly 55%, the dive in the shares has been so deep.
""From a brand perspective, Elon Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Elon Musk,"" said Robert Schein, chief investment officer at Blanke Schein Wealth Management, which owns Tesla shares. ""The more Elon uses Twitter in a political manner, the more he is potentially tarnishing the Tesla brand.""
Schein, who expects the company to be a leading EV player in the long term, is waiting for the stock to fall further to add shares.
""If Tesla falls 15% to 20% from here, we are buying,"" he said.

528,22-Dec-22,The Washington Post,"After poll results, Musk announces he will step down as head of Twitter",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2756516166/BFD812D457A14912PQ/488?accountid=13946,"But the billionaire intends to keep control over product decisions
Elon Musk said he would step down from the CEO role at Twitter - just as soon as he finds someone else ""foolish enough to take the job.""
Still, Musk plans to keep control of the software and servers teams at the social media company, key areas that will allow him to control product decisions.
Musk tweeted his decision Tuesday night in response to an unscientific and unrepresentative poll asking users whether he should step down as head of the company. More than 10 million people, or 57.5 percent of respondents, voted that he should leave the position.
He had previously said he would abide by the results of the informal poll, which he launched Sunday after even some of his own allies criticized some of Twitter's recent policies.
Musk's time leading Twitter has been marked by upheaval and occasionally chaos. The billionaire laid off thousands of employees, disbanded an outside group that oversaw online safety and reinstated prominent suspended accounts, including the one belonging to former president Donald Trump.
Musk's moves have been controversial with many Twitter users and advertisers, risking the company's major source of revenue. But others had cheered his free-speech agenda and urged him to stay on as chief executive.
The CEO joined a Twitter Spaces audio chat in the early morning of Wednesday, saying the company was previously on track to have a ""negative cash flow situation"" of $3 billion a year once revenue and debt servicing that came with Musk's acquisition was taken into account.
""That's why I spent the last five weeks cutting costs like crazy,"" Musk said.
He also said he had met with several Twitter advertisers and called their requests ""reasonable."" Some advertisers have been pulling back from marketing on Twitter since Musk took over as uncertainty reigned. Musk said Friday that advertisers simply want a return on their investment.
Musk said he expects that Twitter's cash flow will reach break-even next year, citing his plans to reduce expenses and charge subscribers for some services.
""That's the reason for my actions,"" he said. ""They may seem sometimes spurious or odd or whatever - it's because we have an emergency fire drill on our hands. That's the reason.""
The entrepreneur, who also leads Tesla and SpaceX, took control of the social media company in October in a $44 billion deal. Musk previously indicated he didn't intend he didn't intend a long-term tenure in Twitter's top spot.
Musk did not directly respond to the results of the poll for more than a day after it closed, but he did react to several tweets that suggested the poll could have been infiltrated by bots or that it wasn't a representative sample of what people wanted.
His tepid response to the poll Tuesday night leaves the door open to him holding on to the top spot for an undetermined amount of time.
""Accurate assessment!"" Musk responded to a tweet that asked why ""offering to take over that thankless job"" would make people upset.
Some Tesla investors had urged Musk to step aside from the social media company to focus his energies on the electric-car company, which has been struggling on the stock market. Shares of Tesla fell more than 8 percent Tuesday during trading.
Musk has used Twitter polls to make critical decisions several times since he took over the company, including on whether he should reinstate Trump. He also asked users whether the company should offer ""general amnesty"" to suspended accounts, many of which then began reappearing on the site.
Musk launched another poll Tuesday night, this time asking users whether Congress should approve a $1.7 trillion deal to fund the government.

529,23-Dec-22,Barron's (Online),"No More Tesla Stock Sales Until 2024, and Other Tidbits From Musk",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2757070931/BFD812D457A14912PQ/104?accountid=13946,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk showed up in a Twitter spaces conversation, and had several tidbits for investors including an important pledge.
Musk committed to not selling Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock for the coming 18 to 24 months, until 2024 or 2025, adding that he sold some stock recently to prepare for worst-case scenarios at Twitter.
Stock Sales
Investors have complained about his stock sales. The sales are difficult to predict and give investors pause when they think about adding to Tesla positions. They don't want to buy in front of a large stock sale from the CEO. Musk has sold roughly $23 billion in Tesla stock in 2022, and most was sold to help close his Twitter purchase.
The Fed
Musk had some concerning words about the economy and believes the Federal Reserve's interest-rate policy will push the economy into a recession, adding that deflation has arrived. Deflation is a double-edged sword for Tesla and all auto maker. Falling costs help, but falling car prices hurt. What's more, buyers can step back and wait to purchase if prices are going lower, which can further weaken demand. Musk also believes the Fed is more responsible for Tesla's stock drop than any overhang from Twitter.
Work Load: Stock sales have been part of the overhang caused by Twitter. So has the possibility that Musk is distracted or overworked after adding another company to his cache, which includes SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Neuralink, along with Tesla and Twitter.
Musk says Tesla's execution is still excellent, and that Twitter isn't too demanding of his time to run. In any case, he has already pledged to step down and name a new CEO of the social-media platform when he could find ""someone foolish enough.""
Margins
Less distraction than Tesla investors have assumed might be a positive, but his views on price and margin might cause some concern. Musk would prefer to grow volumes faster even if it came at the expense of profit margins. That's a ""risk to our 2023 [car pricing] and margin assumptions,"" wrote Canaccord analyst George Gianarikas in a Friday report. He rates Tesla stock at Buy with a $275 price target.
Falling margin assumptions will pressure earnings estimates. Investors don't like to see estimates cut. Wall Street currently projects about $5.66 in earnings per share for 2023, down from about $6 a few months ago.
The Next Plant
Tesla will eventually need more capacity to fuel growth. Musk added in his chat that Tesla is close to announcing a location for its next plant. Tesla has enough capacity to produce roughly 2 million cars a year today.
The Next Product
What products the next plant will produce weren't discussed in detail, but Musk said the product pipeline is exciting, and added that eventually Tesla wants to produce a lower-priced vehicle.
Most cars in the U.S. sell for $35,000 to $45,000. Tesla will eventually need to hit that price point to expand its addressable market.
The Aspiration
Musk was as optimistic as ever, saying again he believes that Tesla will be the world's most valuable company one day. Investors hope he's right.
Coming into Friday trading, Tesla stock is down roughly 64% year to date., while the Nasdaq Composite is down about 33%. Before Musk bought Twitter, Tesla stock was off about 36% so far in 2022, and the Nasdaq was down about 31%. Since the takeover, Tesla stock has dropped 44%, and the Nasdaq is down about 2%.
Tesla stock dropped 8.9% Tuesday. CarMax's (KMX) weaker-than-expected results impacted the entire car sector. CarMax cited declining affordability amid inflation and rising interest rates as a reason for anemic sales and earnings.
CarMax's stock price was cited by Musk on Thursday, too, when discussing the economy.
Tesla shares are down 1.3% in early trading Friday. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are both down about 0.3%.

 No More Tesla Stock Sales Until 2024, and Other Tidbits From Musk

530,23-Dec-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk's Finances Complicated by Declining Wealth, Twitter Pressures; Billionaire's borrowing power has shrunk with Tesla share decline",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2757176146/BFD812D457A14912PQ/136?accountid=13946,"Elon Musk's wealth and borrowing power are now being tested as the Tesla Inc. shares that have fueled his fortune have sharply declined while he aims to stabilize his massive personal investment in Twitter Inc.
The auto maker's share value has fallen 18% this week alone and more than 60% since Mr. Musk announced his plan to buy the social-media platform.
His ability to use his shares at Tesla to raise money, by selling or borrowing against them, has been complicated by their rapid downdraft in recent months.
Historically, Mr. Musk has been a cash-poor billionaire , depending upon so-called margin loans—borrowing backed up by his shares—for his personal expenses and business investments while holding on to his Tesla shares and benefiting from their rising value.
But Tesla's market value has fallen by about $700 billion this year, sinking his personal wealth along the way. The decline in Tesla's valuation comes after years of growth that has allowed him to easily borrow money without having to cash out his shares.
Shares in Tesla have fallen around 65% in 2022, dinged, in part, by the higher interest-rate environment. Another issue relates to the reason he may need cash: Twitter. Tesla investors have been concerned that Mr. Musk's attention is divided following his October takeover of the social-media company.
Late last year, just as Tesla's stock price peaked, he began selling Tesla shares, totaling more than $39 billion including $3.5 billion last week . What his liquidity is like is unknown after what he said would be a more than $11 billion tax bill for 2021 and putting up roughly $25 billion in cash as part of buying Twitter.
Mr. Musk's current Tesla holdings, not including exercisable options, total 424 million shares worth about $52 billion at Friday's closing price of $123.15 a share.
Simply put, if he could tap all of those shares as collateral under Tesla's rules, he would be allowed to borrow about $13 billion. That is only a bit more than he planned to borrow in April as part of the original Twitter deal using just 40% of his shares as collateral , underscoring how his borrowing power has shrunk with the collapse of the car company's share price. He later scrapped those proposed margin loans to fund the deal amid investor concerns over the risk.
Mr. Musk and Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment.
Tesla shares aren't his only asset or only avenue to raise money. He also holds shares in Space Exploration and Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, and has ownership in startups such as the Boring Co. His level of personal indebtedness isn't clear.
Mr. Musk is facing questions about whether Tesla, where he is also chief executive, is ready for a recession as he separately tries to stem losses at Twitter, cutting thousands of workers from his newly acquired social-media platform. Late Tuesday, he said drastic spending cuts at Twitter were required as the company was on track to bleed billions of dollars. His team had been seeking additional investment dollars for Twitter. ""We have an emergency fire drill on our hands,"" Mr. Musk said during a public talk on Twitter Spaces. After taking those drastic efforts, he said, Twitter could break even next year.
While Twitter has rarely been profitable in the past decade, its finances were made more challenging by the debt Mr. Musk took on to fund his acquisition and by a decline in spending by advertisers worried about the erratic changes occurring under his leadership. Analysts estimate the debt expenses alone have added more than $1 billion in cost annually to a company that last year generated $5 billion in sales, mostly from ads.
Mr. Musk has been here before—mired in debt and burning cash as the global economy teeters—and emerged successfully. Those successes and investor enthusiasm for his ventures made him rank as the world's richest person for a time. The drop in Tesla's value this year sent Mr. Musk's ranking as the world's richest man to No. 2 behind Bernard Arnault, the chairman and chief executive of luxury conglomerate LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton . Mr. Musk's fortune fell to an estimated $140 billion as of Thursday from a high of $340 billion a little more than a year ago, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
If he needs cash, Mr. Musk could always sell more Tesla shares, as he did recently. But, in the past, Mr. Musk, Tesla's largest individual shareholder, has been reluctant to sell. At Tesla, Mr. Musk lacks the kind of dual class of stock ownership that gives founders at Meta Platforms Inc. or Alphabet Inc. controlling power. Instead, Mr. Musk's large stake in Tesla, in the past, has effectively given him veto power over shareholder proposals thanks to the company's supermajority vote requirement.
On Thursday, Mr. Musk said he sold some stock to make sure he had ""powder dry…for a worst-case scenario"" and said that he was done selling until probably 2025, though he's made similar statements like that this year only to sell more.
""I'm somewhat paranoid having gone through two really intense recessions,"" Mr. Musk said.
While he had used margin loans before, the idea of borrowing billions off the backs of Tesla shares to help Twitter carries risks.
Tesla's board of directors has limited his borrowing power to essentially 25 cents on every dollar of share value, according to regulatory filings. As the shares fall in value, he must comply with the 25% limit. The risk to Tesla shareholders, as the company describes in its regulatory filings, is that he may have to unload a lot of shares at once to generate cash. He has never disclosed at what price he would need to pony up more collateral.
In recent days, Mr. Musk has swatted down the idea of margin loans altogether. In a tweet, Mr. Musk cautioned that such a move was unwise in this market. ""When there are macroeconomic risks, it is generally wise to avoid using margin loans on any company, as stocks may move in ways that are decoupled from their long-term potential,"" he wrote on Dec. 8.
As of the most recent public filing, Mr. Musk had pledged as collateral more than half of his Tesla holdings, excluding options he could exercise. Pledging doesn't necessarily indicate that actual borrowing against those shares has occurred, the filing said.

531,23-Dec-22,Barron's (Online),Big Tech's 2022 Goes From Bad to Worse. Just Look at These Data.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2757016620/BFD812D457A14912PQ/243?accountid=13946,"It's been a difficult year for the U.S. stock market and in particular its biggest tech names.
The latest slump Thursday only solidified just how bad things have been. This time it was driven by strong economic data, which renewed concerns the Federal Reserve will stay hawkish, as well as chip maker Micron's downbeat outlook. Billionaire hedge fund manager David Tepper saying he's ""leaning short"" on the stock market didn't help either.
The fallout makes for bleak statistical reading, particularly for those of Big Tech persuasion.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell another 2.2% Thursday and is down more than 33% in 2022. The index is on track to fall in all four quarters for the first time ever, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
In a year characterized by rising interest rates, among other things, Big Tech stocks have really felt the pain . FAANG stocks–Facebook's parent Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google's owner Alphabet–have lost $3.03 trillion in market cap in 2022, almost 25% of the total market cap lost in the U.S.
The stark statistics just keep coming. Amazon.com stock closed below its pandemic 2020 closing low Thursday for the first time–the shares are close to 50% down this year. It's one of 26 S&P 500 stocks currently below 2020 lows, while 45 have dropped below that level at some point.
Such drops can lend themselves to buying opportunities in the long run. However, with more rate hikes to come and a potential recession in 2023, investors may be waiting a while.

House Lawmakers Weighing $1.7 Trillion Senate-Passed Spending Bill
The Senate approved a $1.7 trillion spending bill in a 68-29 vote Thursday that would fund the federal government through September 2023. It includes fresh aid to Ukraine, reforms federal election laws, boosts military spending, and encourages retirement saving. House lawmakers were expected to approve the bill.
* Following Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's speech to Congress vowing to never surrender, lawmakers approved about $44.9 billion for Ukraine, for military needs and government and humanitarian spending. ""Your support is crucial,"" Zelensky said Wednesday, adding: ""Is it enough? Honestly, not really.""
* The spending bill includes $772.5 billion for domestic programs and $858 billion in military spending—10% more than the fiscal 2022 level, and more than Biden requested. Shares of suppliers such as Raytheon Technologies and Lockheed Martin popped when the spending bill appeared.
* The bill also updates the 1887 Electoral Count Act, making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election, and bans federal government devices from having the TikTok app, over bipartisan concerns that the China-based service or its parent ByteDance could be forced to surrender data on U.S. users.
* Other included measures: The INFORM Consumers Act targeting the online sale of counterfeit and stolen products, as well as a separate measure that ""strongly encourages"" the Securities and Exchange Commission to repeat its economic analysis for a proposed regulation for private-equity funds, MarketWatch reported .
What's Next: The legislation also extends a Dec. 27 deadline for Boeing to secure federal safety approvals for two new versions of the 737 MAX airplane. Boeing had said it might cancel newer versions of the Max jet without a waiver related to regulatory requirements that it feature modern cockpit-alerting systems.

Longtime Tesla Bull Warns of Signs of Softening Demand
Elon Musk's distraction over how to run Twitter comes at a bad time. Tesla is facing competitive headwinds in the U.S. and China which threaten to leave it missing delivery estimates for the fourth quarter and into 2023, according to Wedbush's Dan Ives, who has long been a fan of the stock.
* Tesla's fourth-quarter deliveries are now likely to be in the range of 410,000-415,000, compared with unofficial Wall Street expectations of around 435,000, Ives wrote in a research note .
* ""Musk is viewed as 'asleep at the wheel' from a leadership perspective for Tesla,"" Ives wrote. He said around 70% of the selloff in Tesla shares in recent months looks to be attributable to Musk's involvement with Twitter , with the remainder due to macroeconomic worries.
* Ives cut his target price on the stock to $175 from $250 on Tesla shares but kept an Outperform rating on the stock. He has now slashed his target from $300 since Musk took ownership of Twitter in late October.
What's Next:Musk has said he is seeking a new CEO of Twitter. Investors will be watching anxiously to see if he sticks to that commitment, as well as the potential of a stock buyback which Musk has said could depend on the severity of a possible recession.

Electric Vehicle Shares Are Down Amid Worries Over Demand
In the car stock version of demolition derby , shares of electric vehicle start-up Rivian Automotive were off 7.2%, Lucid was down 4.8%, and Tesla shares were off about 8.8% in late Thursday trading. All three are at new 52-week lows, showing investors are freaked out about EV demand.
* Tesla increased the incentive to purchase vehicles before the end of 2022 to $7,500 for select Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, up from a prior deal offering $3,750 off.
* CarMax, the nation's largest used car dealer, missed fiscal third-quarter earnings estimates saying that ""vehicle affordability challenges,"" including inflation, rising interest rates, and low consumer confidence have car buyers rethinking purchases.
* CarMax's results appeared to drag down the automotive sector Thursday. Ford Motor stock dropped 4% and General Motors shares fell 6.6%. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5% and 1.1%, respectively.
* U.S. car sales volumes in 2022 are about 25% lower than they were before the pandemic. While used-car prices have started to weaken, new-car prices are still at record levels, hitting $48,481 on average in November, according to Cox Automotive.
What's Next: Tesla CEO Elon Musk pledged in a Twitter spaces conversation not to sell his Tesla stock until 2024 or 2025, saying he sold some stock to prepare for worst-case scenarios at Twitter. He also expects battery material costs to decline and said Tesla is close to picking its next factory location.

U.S. Population Grew 0.4% Over Last Year
America's population grew at a sluggish 0.4% , to 333.3 million for the year that ended July 1. The U.S. recorded 245,000 more births than deaths, as the birthrate rose 2%, but most of the population growth came from new arrivals, the Census Bureau reported.
* The nation's historically low 3.7% unemployment rate is challenging the Federal Reserve's efforts to curb inflation. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last month that demand for workers ""far exceeds"" available supply, and that about 3.5 million people are missing from the labor force compared with before the pandemic.
* Eighteen states lost population, including New York (minus 0.9%), Illinois (minus 0.8%), Louisiana (minus 0.8%), and California (minus 0.3%). Florida saw the largest population gain (1.9%), along with Idaho (1.8%), South Carolina (1.7%), and Texas (1.6%).
* Meanwhile, U.S. life expectancy dropped for the second straight year in 2021, falling to 76.4 years, down from 78.8 years prepandemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Covid-19 remains the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and cancer.
* Drug overdose deaths reached record highs of nearly 107,000 in 2021. The pandemic ""exacerbated many of the stressors in society that make people more vulnerable to taking drugs,"" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, CNN reported.
What's Next: In contrast to Japan, Germany, Italy, Greece, and Portugal, which are seeing their populations decline, the Census Bureau and the United Nations' projections expect the U.S. population to keep growing through the middle of the century, The Wall Street Journal reported.

 Big Tech's 2022 Goes From Bad to Worse. Just Look at These Data.

532,24-Dec-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),Tesla Shares Head for Worst Year Ever as Elon Musk Focuses on Twitter; Wall Street also bristles over weakening demand for Tesla's electric vehicles,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2757278887/BFD812D457A14912PQ/8?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc. is on pace for its worst annual stock performance on record as investors bristle at Elon Musk's Twitter Inc. ownership, as well as declining demand for the car company's electric vehicles and slumps in the broader market in a higher interest rate environment .
Tesla's share slide marks a sharp reversal for the world's most valuable car company . The electric-vehicle maker had been one of the auto industry's biggest winners during the early 2020s, a period plagued by chip shortages, snarled global supply chains and shutdowns related to Covid-19.
The company has lost roughly 70% of its value since the stock hit an all-time high in November 2021. Global economic uncertainty is deepening, and consumers have a growing array of other electric vehicles to choose from, prompting concern on Wall Street that Tesla might need to sacrifice its level of profitability to maintain its pace of growth.
Tesla's stock-price decline has outpaced that of the broader market, as well as many of its rivals, though some electric-vehicle startups have fared worse.
Riding high
Tesla entered 2022 from a position of strength, buoyed by better-than-expected results throughout the Covid-19 pandemic and strong vehicle pricing.
The company has delivered more than a dozen consecutive profitable quarters, helping the electric-vehicle maker that once had a record of being starved for cash in building up a roughly $20 billion cushion , rivaling that of some legacy car manufacturers.
Wall Street jitters
Wall Street tempered its expectations for Tesla's growth this year after an extended Covid-related shutdown of the company's largest assembly plant, located in Shanghai.
Now rising interest rates and global economic uncertainty have stoked concern that demand for new vehicles might be weakening.
Readily available
As recently as earlier this year, customers faced monthslong waits for many Tesla models. No longer.
Tesla cut prices in China this fall and is offering various incentives to move cars off the lot and into customers' driveways before the new year. In the U.S., Tesla is offering buyers of certain EVs a $7,500 credit and 10,000 miles of free fast-charging if they agree to take delivery this month.
Lowered expectations
Tesla, which didn't respond to a request for comment, lowered its full-year growth expectations in October, with Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn saying the company expected to finish the year just shy of its original 2022 goal of increasing deliveries by 50%. The company delivered around 936,000 vehicles to customers in 2021. It would need to hand over more than 1.4 million this year to achieve its original target.
Mr. Musk said this month, ""There is stormy weather ahead , but then there is going to be sunshine thereafter.""
More alternatives
Drivers shopping for an electric vehicle have more options to choose from. Tesla continues to dominate in the U.S., but rivals such as Ford Motor Co. and Rivian Automotive Inc. are gaining traction.
In China, Warren Buffett-backed BYD Co. is widening its lead over Tesla.
Selling spree
Mr. Musk has sold more than $39 billion of Tesla stock since the company's market capitalization peaked. He has pointed to his Twitter involvement in explaining some of those sales. The billionaire bought the social-media company in a deal valued at $44 billion in October, with Twitter taking on roughly $13 billion in debt in the process. He said he wouldn't sell more Tesla shares through next year.
Mr. Musk's sales have rankled investors, some of whom have called on the company to repurchase its own shares for the first time. Mr. Musk said in October that a meaningful buyback was likely, floating the idea of repurchasing $5 billion to $10 billion of shares in 2023. He more recently cautioned that it would be unwise to buy back shares and then end up in a severe recession.

BUSINESS
2022 brought Twitter chaos, crypto's crash, AIS rise and a fusion revolution

For tech, 2022 was a year of serious turmoil, and a few key breakthroughs.
The tech industry celebrated a much-anticipated milestone in fusion energy and what's been hailed as the best AI chatbot tool ever made available to the general public.
But it was generally a time of disruption and uncertainty. The industry reeled from the most serious market downturn in more than a decade. There were big and unexpected challenges. Tech had to navigate fallout from a major war in Europe - and what many describe as the tantrums of a tech pioneer.
SO THIS IS WHAT A MARKET SLUMP FEELS LIKE
Big tech companies and startups enjoyed more than a decade of robust growth with some help from cheap capital and predictable markets. Suddenly, they found themselves grappling with runaway inflation, rising interest rates and a stock market in a tailspin.
Tech companies bore the brunt of the crash. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index has shed 30% year-to-date, compared to the Dow Industrial Average, which has slipped 8%. Tech powerhouses and startups - including Salesforce, Netflix, Tesla, Twitter, Coinbase and Robinhood - began letting people go, sparking a wave of layoffs the tech industry hasn't seen in years.
CRYPTOCURRENCY CRASH
After posting spectacular growth that transformed crypto into a $3 trillion market last year, the 13-year-old industry endured perhaps its worst year in 2022.
The total value of all cryptocurrencies plummeted to under $900 million. The industry reeled from a series of devastating scandals. The biggest one saw the collapse of FTX, once the third-largest crypto exchange. Last week, FTX co-founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was extradited from the Bahamas to face fraud charges. But at least, he'll be home for the holidays. After posting $250 million bail, SBF, as the FTX founder is known, was released and ordered to stay at his parents' Stanford home under arrest.
Crypto also wrestled with longtime worries the technology is good mainly for money-laundering and illicit finance. Russia's invasion of Ukraine turned the spotlight on that fear amid claims that Vladimir Putin and his allies could use blockchain technology to bypass sanctions.
ELON MUSK'S TWITTER
What happens when a trailblazing tech titan who is also the richest man in the world buys a social networking behemoth? Chaos mostly, marked by a surge in vile content and hate speech that the massive social media platform had tried to keep out.
It's still not totally clear what Elon Musk hoped to accomplish by buying Twitter for $44 billion. The Tesla CEO's Twitter takeover generated a lot of buzz for the social network giant - though in a way that also scared some key advertisers away. Still, Twitter remains huge, despite the rise of rival networks like Mastodon. Musk has strongly suggested that he will hand over the reins to someone else.
THE COMPANY
FORMERLY KNOWN AS FACEBOOK
Facebook, which changed its name to Meta in late 2021, spent a great deal of time in 2022 answering questions about what its new focus on the metaverse is all about.
CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified in a court case based on the Federal Trade Commission's attempt to block Meta's plan to acquire Within, a popular virtual reality game. The FTC has argued that Meta is trying to corner a growing market.
Team Zuckerberg had other problems. Meta's shareholders are reportedly concerned about Zuckerberg's metaverse obsession, at a time when users are starting to abandon its core business, Facebook. Meta's stock has plunged more than 60% year-to-date.
Facebook itself has been under fire for the way it managed user data. The social network just agreed to pay $725 million to settle a class action suit that claimed Facebook gave a third party access to data without users' consent.
THE COMING FUSION REVOLUTION
It wasn't all scandals and confusion in tech. Scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory unveiled a major breakthrough, the first fusion reaction in a lab setting that makes it possible to reproduce the power of the sun. Of course, the challenge is how to scale that technology in order to have a meaningful impact on the race to come up with alternative sources of energy for a warming planet.
A CHATBOT LIKE NO OTHER
Then there's ChatGPT, the AI chatbot from OpenAI, the San Francisco AI research and deployment company, which became an instant hit.
The AI tool can answer pretty much any question about any topic. It can also write, composing text in response to the quirkiest of requests like ""a Biblical verse in the style of King James bible explaining how to remove a peanut butter sandwich from a VCR.""
ChatGPT immediately became a huge hit, reaching a million users less than a week after it was released.
GOTTA BEREAL
The quest for a less toxic, more authentic social networking experience made BeReal an unexpected hit in the U.S.. The photo-sharing app seeks to make social network interactions more spontaneous - and real. Unlike more widely used apps like Instagram, BeReal users can post just once a day at a random time. A user is notified when it's time to post a photo.
Launched two years ago by a former GoPro video producer, the photo-sharing app took off in 2022, becoming the No. 1 social networking app on the Apple App Store. BeReal was even featured in a Saturday Night Live skit starring actor Miles Teller, who posts on BeReal while robbing a bank, saying, ""No more curation. I don't care who knows what I'm doing right now. I'm going to be real.""

534,26-Dec-22,The Baltimore Sun,It's the age of the petulant oligarch,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2758069975/BFD812D457A14912PQ/687?accountid=13946,"I think it was 2015 when I got a quick lesson in how easy it is to become a horrible person. I was a featured speaker at a conference in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and my arrival flight was delayed. The organizers, worried that I would miss my slot thanks to the city's notorious traffic, arranged to have me met at the airport and flown directly to the hotel's roof by helicopter.
Then, when the conference was over, there was a car waiting to take me back to the airport. And I found myself thinking, ""What? I have to take a car?"" By the way, in real life I mostly get around on the subway.
Anyway, the lesson I took was that privilege corrupts, that it very easily breeds a sense of entitlement. And surely, to paraphrase Lord Acton, enormous privilege corrupts enormously, in part because the very privileged are normally surrounded by people who would never dare tell them that they're behaving badly.
That's why I'm not shocked by the spectacle of Elon Musk's reputational self-immolation. When an immensely rich man, accustomed not just to getting whatever he wants but also to being a much-admired icon, finds himself not just losing his aura but becoming a subject of widespread ridicule, of course he lashes out erratically, and in so doing makes his problems even worse.
The more interesting question is why we're now ruled by such people. For we're clearly living in the age of the petulant oligarch.
It's not really a surprise that technological progress and rising gross domestic product haven't created a happy, equitable society; downbeat visions of the future have been staples of serious analysis and popular culture for as long as I can remember. But both social critics such as John Kenneth Galbraith and speculative writers such as William Gibson generally imagined corporatist dystopias that suppressed individuality - not societies dominated by thin-skinned egomaniac plutocrats acting out their insecurities in public view.
So what happened?
Part of the answer, surely, is the sheer scale of wealth concentration at the top. Even before the Twitter fiasco, many people were comparing Elon Musk to Howard Hughes in his declining years. But Hughes' wealth, even measured in today's dollars, was trivial compared with Musk's, even after the recent plunge in Tesla stock. More generally, the best available estimates say that the share of total wealth by the top 0.00001% today is almost 10 times what it was four decades ago. And the immense wealth of the modern super-elite has surely brought a lot of power, including the power to act childishly.
Beyond that, many of the superrich, who as a class used to be mostly secretive, have become celebrities instead. The archetype of the innovator who gets rich while changing the world isn't new; it goes back at least as far as Thomas Edison. But the big fortunes made in information technology turned this narrative into a full-blown cult, with wannabe or seem-to-be Steve Jobs types everywhere you look.
Indeed, the cult of the genius entrepreneur has played a large role in the rolling debacle that is crypto. Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX wasn't selling a real product nor, as far as anyone can tell, are those of his former competitors who haven't yet gone bankrupt: After all this time, nobody has come up with significant real-world uses for cryptocurrency other than money-laundering. What Bankman-Fried was selling, instead, was an image, that of the mussy-haired, scruffily dressed visionary who grasps the future in a way normies can't.
Musk isn't in quite the same category. His companies produce cars that drive and rockets that fly. But the sales and especially the market value of his companies surely depend at least in part on the strength of his personal brand, which he can't seem to help himself from trashing ever more with each passing day.
In the end, Musk and Bankman-Fried may end up doing a public service, by tarnishing the legend of the genius entrepreneur, which has done a great deal of harm. For now, however, Musk's Twitter antics are degrading what had become a useful resource, a place some of us went for information from people who actually knew what they were talking about. 
And a happy ending to this story seems increasingly unlikely.

535,27-Dec-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Tesla Suspends Work at Shanghai Factory,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2758231610/BFD812D457A14912PQ/43?accountid=13946,"SINGAPORE -- Tesla Inc. suspended car production at its Shanghai plant on Saturday, extending a planned eight-day production halt at its largest worldwide plant by car output, according to people familiar with the matter.
The halt follows a recent slowdown in global demand for Tesla vehicles. The decision to prolong the work suspension comes as the electric-vehicle manufacturer faces a wave of Covid-19 infections among its workers and suppliers in China, the people said.
On Saturday, Tesla told some of its Shanghai employees that it would stop car production that day, a day earlier than originally planned, the people said. The company earlier told staff that production would resume on Jan. 2, they said.
One of the people said that while it isn't unusual for auto makers to pause work on some production lines during the Lunar New Year holiday and the summer, Tesla hasn't traditionally halted all car production during the Christmas holidays.
Tesla has built up sufficient inventory and the production halt won't hurt its ability to fulfill orders, the people said. During the summer, Tesla boosted the capacity of its Shanghai plant to more than 750,000 vehicles a year. However, demand for its cars has been weaker than expected over the past two months, they said, as China's auto market turned sluggish.
Tesla buyers in China currently can receive their new vehicles within four weeks, compared with September, when the wait was up to five times as long, according to the company's website.
Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. On Sunday, the company told the Global Times, a news outlet run by China's Communist Party, that it had planned for annual maintenance of its car-manufacturing lines in Shanghai this week, and that workers would take a break during the period.
Tesla said it wouldn't shut the workshop that manufactures charging piles during this period, according to the Global Times report. Reuters earlier reported on the suspension.
Covid-19 infections have washed over China in recent weeks after Beijing eased its zero-Covid policies, taking down workers at car makers and their suppliers, as well as dealership staff.
Fewer potential customers have been visiting stores as worries of being infected remain elevated.
Tesla's Shanghai plant was forced to shut down for weeks earlier this year because of Covid-19-related disruptions, prompting Wall Street to temper its expectations for the car maker's growth this year.
Demand in the world's biggest auto market has been weak since October, as Beijing's stringent Covid-19 control measures forced businesses to shut and confined potential buyers at home. Car sales in November fell 9.2% from a year earlier, according to official data.
The China Passenger Car Association on Friday forecast nationwide car sales in December to grow by 4.5% from a year earlier, a relatively modest rate given the year-end expiration of subsidies meant to make EVs more attractive. EV sales, a growth engine for China's car market, have significantly slowed since June.
In the third quarter of the year, Tesla said it produced 22,000 more cars than it delivered globally, fueling concerns of slack demand, especially in China. The company has lost roughly 70% of its market value since its stock hit a record in November 2021, partly as a result of anxieties around weakening demand for EVs.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said Thursday on a Twitter Spaces chat that he expected the global economy to fall into a ""serious recession"" in 2023, pulling down demand for big-ticket items. He said Tesla's gross profit margin has been higher than its peers, which gives it room to maintain sales growth by slashing prices. The car maker has doubled the discounts offered on its two most popular models delivered in the U.S. this month.
Tesla's Shanghai plant accounts for more than half of the company's global car deliveries.

536,27-Dec-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"The Great Tesla Stock Repricing; It's healthy for the car maker, but can Elon Musk's finances handle it?",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2758438204/BFD812D457A14912PQ/73?accountid=13946,"How much money Elon Musk has in the bank suddenly has become a general societal concern. Fans, investors and employees of his non-Tesla businesses, including Twitter, realize that it's Mr. Musk's Tesla wealth that helps keep them afloat.
Tesla shareholders realize how much they have been supporting his other endeavors, which compete for his attention.
In the latest news about one of the strangest corporate acquisitions ever, Twitter's bankers are reportedly trying to reduce calls on Twitter's faltering cash flow. How? By having Mr. Musk personally take over some of the company's corporate debt, using yet more of his Tesla shares as collateral.
This would be a brave stand if it were really needed to preserve Twitter from bankruptcy. But things get complicated for two reasons: his board's requirement that he put up $100 of Tesla stock for every $25 of borrowing, and Tesla's epoch-making plunge, down another $14 on Tuesday.
Mr. Musk gets blame from his most loyal investors for triggering the selloff because of his Twitter engagement, his Tesla stock sales, the potential for margin calls, not to mention his off-color tweeting.
But an occasion for re-rating Tesla was coming anyway. The company has shed a monumental $900 billion in market cap and is still richly priced for a car maker with its growth prospects.
For years analysts justified its share price by saying Tesla wasn't a car company, it was another Apple. Meaning what? Apple isn't some free-spirited, uninhibited innovator spinning off new industries in all directions. It's basically one thing, an iPhone company.
Tesla is one thing, a car company. For a lot of reasons, profit margins on cars will never be as attractive as profit margins on iPhones. And just as no reason exists to believe Apple could dream up another money-spinner equivalent to the iPhone, no reason exists to believe Tesla will invent a product or service to transcend the competitive predicament of a car company.
I made myself unpopular years ago by pointing out that the established, union-employing companies dearest to politicians' hearts would also be lured into making electric vehicles by the same subsidies that lured Tesla. These companies operate under an additional political dispensation, thanks to our fuel-economy regime, which lets them lose money on EVs to preserve the inflated pickup-truck profits they earn behind a 25% pickup import tax in place since LBJ.
Political favoritism has shifted against Tesla. Small example: The subsidized charging network the Biden administration is building devalues the competitive advantage Tesla created for itself by building its own charging network.
Clearly now, Tesla won't have the electric-vehicle market to itself. Whatever growth that market affords—and fans and skeptics remain divided—will be fought over fiercely with other companies.
These makers have learned from Tesla—electric vehicles, for most buyers, are indulgence cars, like GM's giant, sold-out electric Hummer, or Ford's $56,000 Lightning pickup, or its $70,000 Mustang Mach-E GT.
They aren't the tiny runabout Nissan Leafs or Prius-like hybrids that Ohio State University guru Chris Atkinson preaches are the best use of a lithium-ion battery if the goal really is to displace CO2 emissions.
The job of stock analysts is to rationalize the stock prices the world hands us, on the reasonable assumption that prices convey meaningful information. To solve the mystery of Tesla's share price they resorted to the presumption that Mr. Musk would conjure some unforeseen source of future profits.
Government policy also is rationalized. Joe Biden, it's explained, is subsidizing electric vehicles to reduce emissions. But does this really describe either motive or effect? He and his aides may have merely identified a way voters will let him spend money and channel it to business and labor groups that support him. In obvious ways, EV subsidies actually encourage emissions: to build the cars, to mine the minerals for their batteries, to charge them up. In the great lacuna that's seldom mentioned, if EV drivers are subsidized to use less gas, it becomes cheaper for someone else to use more.
The policy bubble hasn't popped yet even if the Tesla bubble has, revaluing the car maker in a manner that is healthier and more realistic in the long run. The biggest test for Mr. Musk was always going to be the company's repricing in line with the opportunities of selling cars into a crowded and competitive car market.
The timing is bad, from a pending expected recession to China's Covid chaos, spiking minerals prices and declining consumer confidence. It isn't the best time for Mr. Musk to encumber his Tesla stake with forced sales and possible margin calls. He suddenly has a lot riding on the Cybertruck, Tesla's bid to catch a share of the protected profits that other car makers have long milked from the closed U.S. pickup truck market.

537,27-Dec-22,USA Today (Online),Mapping Elon Musk's business empire: A guide to Musklandia in the Austin area,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2758387461/BFD812D457A14912PQ/295?accountid=13946,"From Teslas to tunnel sites, it might seem like Elon Musk’s companies are in every corner of Central Texas these days. There's a very good reason for that: There is, in fact, Elon Musk-related activity almost everywhere you look in the Austin area. Musk – one of the world's richest people, CEO of electric automaker Tesla and aerospace company SpaceX and now majority owner of Twitter – said in 2020 that he had moved to Texas, although he says his main residence is in South Texas, not Austin. But there's no doubt Musk has made Austin one of the key centers for his vast business empire. Some of the moves have been well publicized. For instance, Musk moved the corporate headquarters for Tesla to Austin, on the site of the company's new $1.1 billion manufacturing facility. Welcome to Musklandia:Austin adjusts to life with Tesla and its eccentric billionaire boss Elon Musk But a number of his other affiliated companies have also quietly moved their headquarters to the Austin area, or at least opened operational centers here. Much of that has been done with little fanfare, and sometimes with no formal announcement at all, which can make it hard to keep track of for even the most informed Musk follower. So, the American-Statesman decided to compile a detailed list of all of Musk's varied companies and business interests that have shown up in the Austin metro area. Or at least, as close as we can come to mapping all of them; as we said, it can be tough to keep up with all of Musk's moves. But here's what we know right now: More:Elon Musk says Austin's not his home, but he spends a lot of time here, flight records show Tesla leads Austin-area presence Musk's best-known company is electric automaker Tesla. It has its headquarters in Southeast Travis County at the site of the Tesla gigafactory. Austin-area operations: The carmaker moved its corporate headquarters to Austin last year to the site of its $1.1 billion manufacturing facility, Giga Texas, which held a grand opening in April. Musk first announced Travis County would be home to the factory in July 2020, and the facility started producing cars in late 2021. Tesla held a grand opening and delivered the first Austin-made Model Y vehicles in April 2022, and the factory is expected to play a key role in the company's future. The facility is also expected to produce the Cybertruck and Model 3 as well as vehicle batteries, and to employ more than 10,000 workers. The Giga Texas site consists of more than 2,500 acres along the Colorado River. The facility itself is now over 10 million square feet of factory and manufacturing space and includes both vehicle and battery manufacturing. The road on which the company headquarters and manufacturing facility are located has also been renamed from Harold Green Road to Tesla Road.  Musk has also detailed vague plans for an ""ecological paradise"" on the site. In September, Musk said on Twitter that once the factory is financially on its feet the company will build out the ""ecological paradise"" on the south portion of the property. Long-term, Musk said he also wants to have ""little electric Tesla boats with a retro-futuristic Victorian design"" and a boardwalk with amenities that goes all the way to downtown Austin so you can walk, bike or kayak."" Currently, the Tesla property does not connect to downtown Austin, so it's unclear how such a project would be possible. Inside Elon's big, weird Austin party:Music, robots – and even a petting zoo The Boring Company booms in Austin area Musk's tunneling and infrastructure company quietly has moved its corporate headquarters from California to Pflugerville, and it has been rapidly growing is operations in Central Texas. What the company does: The Boring Company is involved with a number of product lines based around tunneling and underground infrastructure. It is working on loop services designed to transport passengers between stations using autonomous vehicles at up to 150 miles per hour. Nationally, the Boring Company has one operational tunnel, a 0.8-mile project underneath the Las Vegas Convention Center, and Las Vegas officials have also approved a 29-mile tunnel system containing 51 stations under the city. The company also previously had a 1.1-mile test tunnel in Hawthorne, Calif., that it recently dismantled, according to Bloomberg news service. Central Texas operations: Pflugerville: The tunneling company has a 40,000-square-foot commercial office space on Impact Way. It now shares the same address as its headquarters. Filings for the facility, along with tweets from the company in 2020, were some of the earliest hints of the company's expansion to Central Texas. Bastrop: The Boring Company is working on an 80,000-square-foot manufacturing and warehouse facility on a Bastrop County property, where it plans to test its tunneling equipment and dig ""as many tunnels as needed for research and development purposes,"" according to filings with the state. Gapped Bass LLC, an entity associated with the company, has also been buying up dozens of acres of neighboring properties. Neighbors have pushed back against the activities and even alleged this year that the Boring Company was using its Bastrop site for living quarters without proper permits. The county sent the company notices of permit violations related to the septic system. Neighbors and environmental groups are also seeking a hearing related to the company's wastewater disposal plans for the site. Proposed Austin-area projects: The Boring Company has reached out to a number of Central Texas cities and entities about potential tunneling projects and has floated the idea of a larger subterranean tunnel connecting Austin and San Antonio. Kyle Crossing project: Kyle, an Austin suburb in Hays County, confirmed in November that it has scrapped a proposal for a Boring Company pedestrian tunnel that would have connected Kyle Crossing, a mostly retail development at FM 1626 and Interstate 35, with Plum Creek, a residential, retail and commercial development. The Kyle tunnel would have allowed pedestrian traffic, along with bikes, scooters and small electric vehicles such as golf carts. The plan was halted in August after Union Pacific Railroad, which has railway tracks running through the area where the tunnel was proposed, rejected the idea of building a tunnel under its rail tracks. The city paid the Boring Company $50,000 for a development service agreement and a feasibility study, using funding from the Kyle Crossing developer. The project never advanced to the point of needing to produce a feasibility study, city officials say. Austin Convention Center project: A November 2021 filing shows the Boring Company is exploring the idea of building a ""new development with associated improvements"" near or at the Austin Convention Center. The filing gives few details but calls the project the ""Austin Loop Transportation System,"" which might suggest the project could include a tunnel similar to Boring Company projects in Las Vegas. Del Valle warehouse: The Boring Company is also planning to build a 220,000-square-foot warehouse not far from Tesla's manufacturing site in Travis County. The warehouse would be on Falwell Lane near the Colorado River and Texas 130, about 10 minutes from Tesla's headquarters, and about 15 minutes from the Austin offices of Neuralink. The filing gives few details about what the company has planned other than the size of the warehouse and calls the project a “horse ranch warehouse,"" and is under the name of a different entity, Horse Ranch LLC. Tesla tunnel: A June 2022 filing showed the Boring Company might also be considering building a tunnel near the Tesla manufacturing facility in Travis County. The project called the ""Colorado River Connector Tunnel,"" calls for a two-mile private access tunnel. SpaceX adding to Austin-area presence SpaceX, Musk's California-based aerospace company, has had a significant Texas presence for several years, with facilities in South Texas and the Waco area. The company, which makes and launches rockets and satellite communications technology, among other things, has also found its way to the Austin area. Bastrop County operations: While Musk and SpaceX have made no formal announcements, filings with the state and job postings over the past two years have indicated the company now has operations in Central Texas. In August, a filing, with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation shows SpaceX likely has plans to construct a facility in Bastrop County off FM 1209, not far from the Colorado River. The company is not listed but it does note a SpaceX employee and the company's McGregor address, under the name of “Project Echo."" It calls for a 521,521-square-foot shell building that will start construction on the site in October, with plans to complete it in July 2023 for an estimated cost of $43 million. A separate filing with the Texas Commission for Environmental Quality lists the company by the name Space Exploration Technologies Corp, the same project name as well as the McGregor address. That filing also gives few details, but it estimated construction on a project would start in June and finish in March 2023. Neuralink in the Austin area, as well Neuralink, Musk's California-based neurotechnology company, is working to develop a computer-brain interface, which is intended to let people control a computer or mobile device using their minds. Musk has described the technology as a Fitbit in your skull with wires that go into your brain. The secretive company has yet to bring a product to the market and rarely shares public updates. Austin-area operations: Documents show the Neuralink plans to build on a site in the Del Valle area of Travis County. The plans call for eight buildings on the site, with office space and multiple laboratories. Those include a 78,000 square-foot building with two office spaces and warehouse space, and a 5,850 square-foot office described as an animal vet office. During a December event, an employee said Neuralink's device manufacturing moved to Austin and the office has a double operating room and plans to build out a clinic. The company had previously posted job listings and on social media suggesting the existence of an Austin office. In Central Texas, Neuralink's site plans are listed under the name of a subsidiary or related entity, River Bottoms Ranch LLC. The Elon Musk Foundation Musk's private foundation was founded in 2001 and is focused on renewable energy, advocacy, space exploration, pediatric research, science and engineering education, and research and development around artificial intelligence. The foundation has been awarded a number of grants and keeps a bare-bones website. In the summer of 2020, the California-based foundation created an entity in Austin. The two entities then merged, and the resulting entity is now based in Central Texas. Other Musk-affiliated ventures Excession LLC: This is Musk's wealth management entity and manages his assets. The firm moved to Austin in July 2020, although it still maintains a California office. Excession is run by Jared Birchall, who is also CEO of Neuralink, a director at the Boring Company, and a board member for the Elon Musk Foundation. Ad Astra/ Astra Nova School: A self-described ""experimental school"" originally founded for the children of SpaceX employees. The school is now available to anyone ages 10-14 globally. The school started under the name Ad Astra at SpaceX in California but changed its name to Astra Nova and became an online school. It is still listed as Ad Astra on California and Texas filings. The school is now all online, and offers full-time and part-time enrollment, with class sizes of 6-16 students, and serves 185 students across its programs according to its website. The school opened in Texas in July 2021 and lists an Austin post office box as its address. Its Texas directors are listed as Jared Birchall and Elon Musk. Twitter coming to Austin? With Musk taking a controlling interest in social media platform Twitter, would he move some of the company's operations to the Austin area? It would make sense, industry analysts say. And Musk himself said in a recent meeting with Twitter employees that he would consider the idea of a dual California/Texas headquarters. Even before the Twitter deal closed, Musk was encouraged to move the company to Texas, including in April when Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted “bring Twitter to Texas to join Tesla, SpaceX, and the Boring Company.” A Central Texas rancher, Jim Schwertner, president and CEO of Schwertner Farms even tweeted an offer of 100 acres free of charge if Musk would move Twitter's corporate offices to the site in Schwertner, an unincorporated community east of Jarrell.

538,28-Dec-22,Barron's (Online),Tesla Falls to Two-Year Low. Why It May Not Have Bottomed Out.,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2758541260/BFD812D457A14912PQ/95?accountid=13946,"The decline of Tesla shares this year has been just as incredible as its meteoric rise over the past few years.
The stock fell to a two-year low on Tuesday, capping an almost 70% retreat since Jan. 1. The electric-vehicles company made Elon Musk the wealthiest man by some distance at the start of the year. Twelve months later, he is not .
You can make a long list of all the reasons for the company's devaluation, which range from small ones to big. It starts with production problems in China—most recently manufacturing being suspended at a plant in Shanghai for about a week, according to Reuters and other media. Deliveries data published next week could also weigh heavy.
Then there's concern about competition from other electric car makers, to worries about demand for cars themselves, to the grim outlook for the economy in general. On top of that there's Elon Musk himself and his dalliance with Twitter, which led to both a distraction from Tesla and repeated sales of his own stock in the company.
There are even bigger reasons to be concerned. The Federal Reserve's interest-rate hikes whacked stocks in general, especially high-growth ones that had attracted lots of money when rates were at zero and everyone was desperately searching for yield.
But despite all that, Tesla is still trading at 19 times forward earnings. Porsche is at 17 times. Mercedes-Benz trades at five times earnings, Ford at six. That may not be the best metric with which to value Tesla, but it is an indication that it remains relatively expensive.
And yet only one of 38 analysts surveyed by FactSet rate the stock Sell. It may have soared like a SpaceX rocket, but the company still hasn't returned all the way to Earth.

Southwest Reduces Flight Schedule as Airline Chaos Continues
Southwest, the low-cost airline that has been worst hit by winter storms over the holiday, will operate about a third of its schedule through at least Thursday.
* Southwest canceled 64% of its flights on Tuesday and 62% of flights on Wednesday, according to FlightAware. The company's shares slipped in premarket trading .
* CEO Bob Jordan posted an apology on the company's website on Tuesday and said the company is doing everything it can to return to normal operations. He cited the carrier's size—it's the largest in 23 of the top 25 travel markets in the U.S.— as a big reason for the problems.
* Jordan also said that, unlike most other airlines, Southwest builds its schedule around communities rather than hubs. That means if the weather shuts down just a few airports, it creates a bigger disruption for the company's network.
What's Next: Pete Buttigieg, the secretary of transportation, said Tuesday that the company will be held accountable for the mass cancellations.

Russia's Putin Bans Oil to Nations Imposing Price Cap
Russia's President Vladimir Putin has banned oil sales to countries imposing a price cap, The Wall Street Journal reported. The ban begins Feb. 1 and lasts through July 1. He can make exceptions, but didn't lay out the criteria for special permission.
* The ban, which came Tuesday in response to what Putin described as unfriendly actions of the West that contradict international law, is designed ""to protect the national interests of the Russian Federation,"" the Journal reported.
* The European Union and the U.K. have banned the import of seaborne Russian crude, and the Group of Seven has capped other sales by barring Western companies from insuring, financing, or shipping Russian crude at more than $60 a barrel .
* Brent crude , the international standard, rose 0.41% to $85.03 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate , the U.S. standard, rose 0.38% to $79.61. China comprises nearly half of the projected 2023 growth in daily oil demand, about 1.7 million barrels.
What's Next: ""A combination of lower Russian oil supply and OPEC+ supply cuts means the global oil market is expected to tighten over 2023,"" ING analysts wrote in a research note. They project Brent crude prices to average $104 a barrel in 2023 and WTI to average $101.

Home Prices Slid for Fourth Straight Month
Home prices nationwide dropped in October—a seasonally adjusted 0.3%—for a fourth straight month, according to S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Indices. The trend of dips should keep going in the coming year as higher mortgage rates dent sales volumes.
* Price gains slowed to 9.2% year over year, from 10.7% in September. The steady decline comes after ""very strong price increases"" in late 2021 and the first half of 2022, said Craig Lazzara, managing director of S&P Dow Jones Indices, which publishes the Case-Shiller numbers.
* Case-Shiller's 20-city composite, tracking the nation's largest metropolitan areas, fell a seasonally adjusted 0.5%. Las Vegas, Phoenix, and San Francisco had the biggest drops; prices in Chicago, Seattle, and Portland, Oregon, fell the least month over month.
* Surging mortgage rates have ended the pandemic-driven housing boom that pushed up sales prices. Existing-home sales dropped for the 10th straight month in November. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.27% as of Dec. 22, up from 3.05% last year, according to Freddie Mac .
* The median existing-home price rose 3.5% from last year to $370,700 in November, the National Association of Realtors said. Miami home prices grew at the fastest annual rate at 21%, followed by Tampa's 20.5%, and Charlotte's 15%, The Wall Street Journal reported.
What's Next: Slowing home price growth and lower sales volume ""will likely continue into 2023, with prices expected to decline annually by the second quarter,"" said Selma Hepp, CoreLogic's deputy chief economist. ""But, if mortgage rates continue to fall, renewed optimism could reinvigorate the housing market in 2023.""

 Tesla Falls to Two-Year Low. Why It May Not Have Bottomed Out. 
"
539,28-Dec-22,Barron's (Online),Add Taxes to the Many Reasons Why Tesla Stock Is in Free Fall,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2758529938/BFD812D457A14912PQ/116?accountid=13946,"Tesla stock is in free fall, on pace for its worst year ever. Investors are selling over fears related to electric-vehicle demand, Tesla's own stock chart , and certain choices made by CEO Elon Musk . There's also another reason the shares have been dropping in December: Taxes .
Investors can always sell some of their losers at the end of any year to generate capital losses they can then use to offset capital gains taxes generated by selling winners in the same year.
That tax-loss harvesting can have a real impact. Academics have looked at stock price movements near the end of years for, well, years and found that tax planning can explain part of why stocks do some of what they do in December and January.
Along with the formal research there are anecdotes. General Electric (GE) had a difficult 2018, culminating in the removal of one CEO, John Flannery, and the appointment of Larry Culp , the first CEO to come from outside the company.
Culp had a tall task turning the conglomerate around and cut the GE quarterly dividend shortly after he arrived on Oct. 30, 2018, to a penny . After the cut, GE stock was down about 40% for the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up about 1% over the same span.
The Culp hiring and the dividend cut — made to preserve GE's cash and help repair its ailing balance sheet — were both seen as mostly positive by Wall Street. Still, GE stock fell another 25% the rest of 2018, while the Dow only dropped about 6%.
Harvesting some tax losses played a role in that continuing slide for GE. Just look at what happened in January. Shares rose 34% for the month while the Dow added about 7%. The stock ended January 2019 at almost the exact same level it closed following the dividend cut.
Maybe Tesla investors can take some solace from the GE example. They could use some comforting. Coming into Wednesday trading, Tesla shares have dropped about 61% over the past three months and have plunged about 69% this year. It's the worst year ever for Tesla — by a lot.
Tesla stock dropped in 2016 by about 11%. Excluding 2022, it's the only year Tesla stock has dropped on a full-year basis. Tesla held its initial public offering in 2010.
There are many reasons for the drop in Tesla shares this year. Tesla stock was down about 36%, or roughly $130 a share, from the end of 2021 until Elon Musk took over Twitter in late October. The Nasdaq Composite was off about 31% over the same span. Most of Tesla's loss, until that point, could be explained by the market's unease over rising interest rates and inflation.
Then Tesla stock dropped another 25%, or about $60 a share, from the takeover to just after Elon Musk's derogatory tweet about Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on Dec 11. Perhaps investors can use that drop to judge the impact Twitter has had on their Tesla positions.
Shares have fallen another 35%, or roughly $60 a share, since the Fauci tweet to today. That drop can be partly blamed on weakness in electric-vehicle demand. Musk himself sounded the demand alarm when talking to Twitter users and investors on a Twitter Spaces chat Dec. 22.
Will all that's going on, it's difficult to predict a GE-like level that Tesla stock can go back to in January 2023. The stock chart looks like there is some support at $100 a share. At $100, shares would be trading for about 20 times Wedbush analyst Dan Ives bear case 2023 earnings estimate of about $5 a share. That price-to-earnings ratio ratio is less than the 25 times PepsiCo (PEP) trades for. (Tesla just sold semi-trucks to PepsiCo .)
At 25 times $5 a share, maybe Tesla goes back to $150 in January. Only time will tell.
As for tax-loss harvesting, there are rules. ""You can't deduct a loss from the sale of stock or securities if, during the 61-day period beginning 30 days before the sale, you've acquired, or entered into an option or contract so to acquire, substantially identical stock or securities,"" said accounting expert Robert Willens .
Complicated rules are one reason it's always a good idea to have a financial advisor who is well-versed in tax details which are difficult for investors, with day jobs, to stay on top of.

540,28-Dec-22,USA Today (Online),Here's why Tesla stock is on track for its worst year and why it could recover in 2023,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2758713586/BFD812D457A14912PQ/222?accountid=13946,"Once the darling stock of many investors' portfolios, Tesla is now a source of anguish.  At the end of 2021, Tesla was a $1.1 trillion company. But as of Dec. 28, it was worth $353 billion, a 68% decline. The stock is down over 70% year-to-date and it's on track for its worst month, quarter and year ever.  It's hard to believe that shares of the same company skyrocketed by more than 1,100% from the beginning of 2020 to the end of 2021. How did Tesla go from a lucrative safe bet to a seemingly loss-churning machine? And is the stock capable of turning a corner in 2023? Mapping Elon Musk's business empire: A guide to Musklandia in the Austin area Did Elon Musk fire himself?: Twitter users vote in poll to expel CEO from his position Elon Musk's Twitter 'side-hustle'  As if being the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX wasn't enough to keep Elon Musk busy, the billionaire bought Twitter for $44 billion and became its CEO in late October. Over the course of 2022, Musk sold $23 billion worth of Tesla stock to help fund the purchase of the social media company. ""It's put a massive albatross over Tesla,"" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. He estimates that 70% of Tesla's selloff is ""Musk-Twitter driven."" If Musk didn't buy Twitter Ives said Tesla shares would be hovering around $200. Shares closed at nearly $113 on Wednesday. Musk regularly posts divisive tweets like the following:  ""There are brand issues related to that,"" Ives said. ""The last thing you want to do is alienate 50% of the population when you're selling to the masses,"" he added, referring to Musk's staunch alignment with Republican ideology. Musk suspends journalists on Twitter: Outlets impacted include CNN, New York Times, Washington Post More Twitter suspensions: Twitter @ElonJet account that tracks Elon Musk's private jet flights suspended again Tech stocks got slammed in 2022 Tesla's selloff this year didn't occur in a bubble. Tech stocks were one of the hardest-hit sectors in 2022 due to the macroeconomic headwinds ushered in by the Federal Reserve's massive rate hikes aimed at taming inflation.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is on track for a 35% loss for the year compared to the more diversely allocated S&P 500 that's on track for a 20% loss. (Tesla is included in both indices.) Musk's declining net worth: After Tesla stock slide, Elon Musk is no longer richest person in the world, Forbes says 'This is a dicey moment': Amazon, Apple, other tech giants lose billions in value as market wobbles But the tech selloff is all the more reason why shareholders ""need a steady pilot to get Tesla through this storm and not a Ted Striker,"" said Ives, referencing a character in the film ""Airplane!"" who is a former pilot that develops a fear of flying. Tesla suspends production at Shanghai plant To make matters worse for Tesla shareholders, the company recently suspended vehicle production at its Shanghai plant. The suspension came as COVID-19 cases surged after the Chinese government reversed its restrictive zero-infection policies, Reuters reported.  Additionally, Reuters reported that the plant will halt production from Jan. 20-31, an extended break from the Chinese New Year which is not common practice for the car maker. The Shanghai plant accounts for the majority of Tesla's production. The suspensions likely won't result in a shortage of Teslas since inventory is likely piling up, causing the company to discount vehicles, according to Ives. Will Tesla stock recover? Analysts are optimistic that Tesla will stage a recovery in 2023. It's a good sign that Musk is searching for someone to replace him as CEO of Twitter, Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said in a recent note. CFRA views Tesla as a ""strong buy"" and has a 12-month price target of $225 a share. Ives said he's ""bullish on Tesla."" However, he has one of the most conservative price targets of $175 a share among bullish Tesla analysts surveyed by FactSet.

""Don't be too bothered by stock market craziness,"" Musk wrote in an email to staff that was reported by CNBC. ""As we demonstrate continued excellent performance, the market will recognize that. Long-term, I believe very much that Tesla will be the most valuable company on Earth!""
Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the memo.
The messages came as an addendum to a note congratulating Tesla employees on their hard work over the past year. The value of the electric-vehicle maker has plummeted this year amid rising interest rates and Musk's purchase of social-media site Twitter, which has taken up a lot of the CEO's time.
On Wednesday, Tesla stock snapped a record streak of seven straight days of losses. The stock has lost almost 70% of its value this year and 61% over the past three months. The declines have pushed Tesla out of the top 10 most valuable companies and ousted Musk from his perch as the world's wealthiest person.
Separately, about 10,000 Twitter users reported experiencing problems accessing the service on Wednesday, according to the website Downdetector. That would be the first widespread outage since Musk took over the company. Musk, when asked on Twitter about the problems, tweeted that ""it works for me.""

542,29-Dec-22,"Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition",Tesla Suffers December Selloff --- EV maker shares are trading at August 2020 levels after steep fall in recent months,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2758949249/BFD812D457A14912PQ/128?accountid=13946,"Tesla Inc.'s stock has endured a bruising December as shares in the car maker that are headed for their worst-ever year have stumbled on new demand concerns and a shutdown at its China factory.
Elon Musk's electric-vehicle maker is cruising toward its worst December stock performance and endured a seven-day losing streak through Tuesday's close. It was Tesla's longest losing streak since September 2018 when the company was struggling to get its new Model 3 into customer hands.
Tesla gave up almost a third of its value during the recent seven days of losses, trading back at August 2020 levels. Shares recovered somewhat Wednesday, closing 3.3% higher.
Despite the company's delivering consistent earnings and being on-pace for its biggest ever annual profit, Tesla investors have been spooked by a variety of factors, including Mr. Musk's pursuit of Twitter Inc., which has kept the car maker's chief executive focused on buying and then turning around the social-media platform.
Adding to investor worries have been questions about demand amid rising interest rates, which have stung once-triumphant growth stocks across the market. Those intensified in recent days as Tesla offered large discounts to get shoppers to take vehicles before year-end. It is the kind of move more closely associated with traditional auto makers than with Tesla, where Mr. Musk has often poo-pooed the marketing gimmicks employed by legacy car companies.
Despite deploying some old-school car-making sales tricks, Tesla, the largest auto company by market value, still sports valuations that outstrip its traditional Detroit, European and Asian rivals. Even after its recent tumble, Tesla trades with a price-to-earnings ratio of around 19.4, compared with roughly 16.7 for the S&P 500. Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp., by comparison, recently traded at around 6.4 times and 8.5 times their projected earnings.
Tesla isn't the only once-hot auto stock to sharply go into reverse. Shares in smaller EV rivals Rivian Automotive Inc. and Lucid Group Inc. both have fallen more than 80% this year.
Mr. Musk added to demand concerns last week when he blamed high interest rates for weighing on vehicle demand. He also said recession fears could weigh on Tesla's decision to pursue a share buyback that some investors for months have been clamoring for. Mr. Musk in October said a meaningful stock repurchase was likely.
The company's dramatic stock plunge this year has lured investors in to bet on a further decline. Bearish Tesla investors have made around $17 billion in 2022, their first gains on record, according to S3 Partners data.
""I would expect more short selling in the stock until we see a firm priced floor established,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, a managing director at S3.
Tesla also has been grappling with production issues. Earlier this year China's strict Covid policies temporarily idled the car maker's Shanghai plant, its largest factory by volume. Later, Mr. Musk lamented that new factories in Texas and Germany were ""gigantic money furnaces"" Production concerns were rekindled this month in China when the company again suspended car production at its Shanghai plant on Saturday, extending a planned eight-day production halt at the facility, people familiar with the matter have said.
Mr. Musk has been upbeat about Tesla's operational performance, repeatedly praising teams for their execution.
Tesla shares have fallen 68% this year.
In recent months, Tesla's brand image also has taken a hit, in part from Mr. Musk's tumultuous involvement in Twitter and some of the commentary he has made on the platform, according to brand surveys
Still, individual investors have been doubling down, purchasing a net $16 billion of Tesla stock this year, according to data from Vanda Research. That makes it the most popular buy among individuals this year, dethroning Apple Inc. as the most-purchased stock by individuals. On Wednesday, for example, Tesla shares were the most popular buy among individual investors on the Fidelity brokerage platform.
Institutional and individual investors have also dished out more for options tied to Tesla than any other stock, according to Cboe Global Markets data as of Dec. 15.
""It's one of the most popular stocks out there,"" said Viraj Patel, global macro strategist at Vanda Research, who follows retail investing. The selloff ""draws bargain hunters.""

Analysts fear CEO's antics are 'killing the company'

Everybody's talking about Twitter. But what about Tesla?
Remember the last scene in ""Thel-ma and Louise""? That's how some analysts and investors view what Elon Musk is doing to Tesla with his Twitter antics - pedal to the metal, roaring the electric car company toward that cliff as it sheds an astounding $600 billion off its market cap.
Musk triggered chaos on Twitter after buying the social network. Analysts now warn the Twitter turmoil could cause serious harm to the trailblazing, iconic electric-car company he created.
The company's stock has fallen steadily due to production disruptions and worries about the global economy. But investors are also selling off due to the fallout from its CEO's tumultuous reign at Twitter.
Analysts and investors are increasingly fearful that Twitter has become a serious distraction for the Tesla chief, and that the turbulent and eccentric way he's leading the social media giant could be hurting the electric car company's image.
Daniel Ives, managing director at Wedbush, said that unless Musk ""course corrects"" in the next four to six weeks, the damage to Tesla could be irreparable.
""Musk is the heart and lungs of the Tesla story,"" said Ives. ""This self-inflicted Twitter trainwreck has taken, in our opinion, $600 billion off the market cap alone. This is a historic sell off.... It's a five-alarm blaze that no one could put out.""
Tesla shares did rise 3% Wednesday, although some market observers speculated that the rally was a dead-cat bounce. (The stock started edging lower after hours.)
There's so much uncertainty around Tesla, Yahoo Finance Editor Brian Sozzi quipped, ""it maybe easier to change a tire on a Model S in under 10 minutes than to try to call a bottom in Tesla's battered stock.""
In a note to clients, Ives said that the Tesla CEO is ""viewed as 'asleep at the wheel' at a time when the company needs to deal with ""this Category 5 storm.""
Tesla had been on a roll late last year when propelled by strong demand for electric cars the company's stock price hit more than $1,000 a share and its market cap exceeded $1 trillion.
Musk was still bragging about Tesla's momentum in October shortly before the Twitter sale closed, telling analysts on the company's earnings call that ""I see a potential path with Tesla worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined."" ""I think we've got the most exciting product portfolio of any company on Earth,"" Musk said.
But Tesla investors were already jittery about the company's prospects. The automaker's stock had been falling since late March as the company grappled with what Ives called ""dark macro clouds,"" including a production shutdown in China. The company plans to scale back producing at its Shanghai plant in January, according to a Reuters report.
Then Musk took over Twitter, setting off pandemonium on the social network.
Musk has been accused of upending controls put in place to manage hateful and vile content on Twitter. Musk himself has joined the fray, endorsing false conspiracy theories about and mean-spirited attacks against presidential health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci. ""My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci,"" he tweeted recently.
In fact, Musk's new public image is not exactly that of the comic, bumbling but affable hero in ""Airplane."" Instead, he's increasingly viewed as an unhinged tech executive who morphed into a right-wing provocateur.
It didn't take long for Musk's controversial pronouncements and actions to prompt some Tesla's investors to speak.
National security analyst Joe Cirinci-one tweeted, ""I'm a Tesla investor and I want Elon Musk to get off Twitter. The value of my shares has been cut in half since he made his move to take over this platform. I love my Model 3, but he is killing the company with his antics.""
While Tesla is clearly dealing with issues related to a slumping global economy, ""Elon blaming Tesla decline on macro is disingenuous,"" Gary Black, co-founder of The Future Fund, said in a tweet.
""There's apiece that's due to macro,"" he added. ""But [the] vast majority is self-inflicted,"" adding that Tesla shares have also fallen due to ""Twitter noise.""
Musk has said that he plans to ""reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time."" But that hasn't eased investor worries.
""It's a white-knuckle period for Tesla investors,"" Ives said. ""The problem is he continues to double down and he goes to the beat of a different drum. That's part of his genius, but if s also nowbeen part of the downfall.""
Ives told clients that despite the harm caused by ""the Musk-Twitter circus show,"" there's still time for Tesla to bounce back.
""It's a moment of truth,"" Ives said. Musk could either ""focus back on the golden child, Tesla. Otherwise, this could get a lot uglier.... The Twitter spiderweb - it's really an albatross for Tesla's stock that continues to grow.""

544,29-Dec-22,Wall Street Journal (Online),"Elon Musk and Cathie Wood Are Almost Right About the Fed; The two are correct in that higher rates are dragging down tech, but that is hardly the whole story",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2758979038/BFD812D457A14912PQ/421?accountid=13946,"Some of tech's biggest losers this year, including Elon Musk and Cathie Wood, haven't exactly been poster children of successful investing lately. But, especially as tech stocks are starting to look pretty cheap, investors might want to heed at least some of their advice.
Both Mr. Musk and Ms. Wood have publicly blamed rising interest rates for their assets' poor performance. Ms. Wood published an open letter to the Federal Reserve back in October warning that the central bank's hawkish stance raised the risks of a ""deflationary bust."" Replying to an investor's gripe in a tweet earlier this month over Tesla's recent stock drop, Mr. Musk similarly called the Fed ""the real problem."" As the return on risk-free Treasurys rises, he explained in another tweet, the value of owning more-risky equity assets drops.
The underperformance of Ms. Wood's exchange-traded funds and Mr. Musk's largest asset can't be entirely blamed on the Fed. The ARK Innovation ETF has fallen 67% this year, while Tesla's stock is down 65%. The Nasdaq-100, a tech-heavy index that includes only nonfinancial companies, is down 33%.
But the phenomenon these tech celebrities describe has broadly been true of late. A report published last year by Nasdaq Investment Intelligence on the interest-rate sensitivity of major indexes shows a negative correlation between the Nasdaq-100 and the average yield change of 10-year Treasury notes in 2021—a dynamic that continues to exist. This fits with what is taught in business schools and accepted across Wall Street: The valuation of growth stocks is tied to their future earnings potential, and as yields rise, the present value of those future earnings should diminish in value.
Of course, reality hasn't always been quite so simple. Nasdaq Investment Intelligence actually found that the Nasdaq-100's performance has been positively correlated with the yield on 10-year Treasurys over the past 30 years, except when rates get to a high range and keep rising. That could be because early on in rate-hiking cycles, the economy is performing strongly. What this suggests is that investors need to keep an eye on many macroeconomic factors, not just rates.
Even as we look forward to another year of potentially rising rates , some tech stocks are set to end the year looking almost irresistibly cheap. Take Facebook owner Meta Platforms, whose shares are currently fetching 14.8 times forward earnings, versus an average of nearly 29 times across the past 9½ years. Over the past few months, Meta has taken steps to right its business in a declining ad environment, laying off 13% of its workforce and cutting noncore projects. Indeed, JPMorgan upgraded shares of Meta to Overweight earlier this month, citing more-favorable risk/reward and valuation.
Ditto that for such stocks as Amazon.com, Airbnb and DoorDash, all of which have materially underperformed broader indexes this year, despite being businesses that, in aggregate, are still growing even on top of their respective pandemic surges.
To tech enthusiasts, these kinds of sales might look something like a New York City penthouse selling for under $5 million or an Hermès Birkin bag for a ""mere"" thousand bucks.
Just because something is cheap doesn't necessarily make it a great investment. If the Fed suspends rate increases next year as many market watchers expect, tech stocks would be due for a bounce. But contra Mr. Musk and Ms. Wood, that isn't the only thing weighing on the sector. Other macroeconomic factors need to be taken into account.
Meta said in October that it expects its largest-ever year-over-year revenue decline in the fourth quarter, down around 7% at the midpoint of its outlook. The company was clear that some of its performance is ""just going to depend on the broader economy."" In particular, the company stressed that worsening foreign-exchange rates would weigh on its top line.
Amazon similarly was clear on its third-quarter conference call that the broader economic environment would play a big role in its fourth-quarter earnings. The company highlighted ""broad-scale inflation"" and rising fuel and energy costs leading consumers to reassess their purchasing power, and corporations to reconsider their technology and ad spending.
Over the past two years, investors have been punished for forgetting that company fundamentals matter. Next year, they could be punished for forgetting the bigger story, too.

But lo, the Biden Administration is coming to Mr. Musk's aid with a new plan to use the renewable fuel program in a way that subsidizes Teslas and other already subsidized EVs.
Congress's ethanol mandate offers a case study in the political difficulty of weaning industries off government support -- and how regulators can revamp programs to serve new political ends. Politicians of both parties rallied around the renewable fuel standard (RFS) in 2005 as a way to boost U.S. energy independence and reduce CO2 emissions. It has done the opposite. The RFS requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels into their products. Refiners keep crashing into the so-called blend wall -- the amount of ethanol U.S. vehicles and energy infrastructure can handle. Ethanol blends higher than 10% can corrode engines and gas-station tanks. As vehicles have become more fuel efficient, it has become harder for refiners to comply. Large refiners have started producing ""advanced"" biofuels while smaller ones must buy credits known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs). Increasing compliance costs have driven several small refiners to shut down. A refining shortage, especially on the East Coast, is a major reason prices for gasoline and diesel shot up early in the summer far more than for crude.  The Biden EPA's back-door EV subsidy will compound these problems. EPA is proposing to increase the overall RFS to 22.68 billion gallons in 2025 from 20.63 billion this year. The cellulosic ethanol component -- which EPA in the past has repeatedly revised down because production has fallen far short of its ethereal mandates -- will climb to 2.13 billion gallons from 630 million.
Here's the kicker: Refiners will be allowed and by necessity required to comply with these mandates by buying ""eRINs"" credits from EV manufacturers. ""While the production of liquid cellulosic biofuel has remained limited in recent years,"" EPA says, ""the inclusion of eRINs into the program affords another opportunity for dramatic growth of cellulosic biofuel.""
Not really. The proposal is one more way to boost EV margins at the likes of Tesla, which lobbied for inclusion in the RFS. As EPA explains, the new eRINs credits will ""incentivize activities that can increase electrification of the fleet, which could include lowering the cost of EVs and/or increasing the availably [sic] of public access charging infrastructure.""
The details of the scheme would win a Rube Goldberg award. Electricity isn't a renewable fuel per se, but EPA says that methane digesters from landfills and dairy farms can generate ""biogas"" that can generate electricity that can power EVs. EPA, however, concedes there's no way to distinguish electricity made from cow manure and trash from coal or solar power.
So EPA proposes that auto makers submit data on their EV fleet size, typical drivers' mileage and battery charging efficiency, among other things, for the agency to plug into an algorithm that spits out eRINs to sell to refiners. Tesla is expected to be the program's biggest beneficiary because it has the most EVs on the road.
The more EVs that auto makers sell, the more credits they will generate. Meantime, the Administration's rising fuel economy mandates will make it harder for refiners to comply with the increasing renewable-fuel mandates. That means refiners will have to buy more eRINs and will pass on the costs via higher gas prices.
In sum, the Administration is proposing another huge wealth transfer from folks who drive gas-powered cars to Tesla and other makers of electric vehicles.

547,30-Dec-22,"New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast)","It Was a Bad Year for Stocks, and a Worse Year for Tesla",https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2759362983/BFD812D457A14912PQ/182?accountid=13946,"FILE — Tesla vehicles charge at the One Paseo mall in San Diego, Calif., July 21, 2021. Tesla remains the most valuable car company and the only major automaker regarded as a growth stock. (Roger Kisby/The New York Times)

In a down year for stocks, the 65% drop in Tesla’s share price stands out for the scale of wealth vaporized and the unorthodox behavior of its CEO, Elon Musk.
The collapse of Tesla’s stock price destroyed about $672 billion in market value. And Musk, once hailed as a genius who remade the car industry, appears increasingly distracted by his acquisition of Twitter and is using the social network to vent his frustrations. He insulted one of his critics this week by describing him as having “tiny testicles.”
The spectacle has stunned investors and analysts. And many are asking what will happen to the stock, the company and Musk in 2023. The answer largely depends on Musk and Tesla’s board of directors.
Will he return his attention to Tesla and its myriad challenges? Or will he remain camped out at Twitter? Will Musk sell more Tesla shares to keep Twitter going after spending $44 billion to buy that company, despite promising not to? Will the Cybertruck, Tesla’s first new passenger vehicle in three years, finally be available for sale? And perhaps most importantly, will Tesla’s board do anything to rein in Musk?
In a deteriorating economy, these uncertainties have forced investors to fundamentally reevaluate Tesla’s prospects. It remains the most valuable car company and the only major automaker regarded as a growth stock. But investors are no longer convinced that Tesla can dominate the auto industry the way that Apple dominates smartphones or Amazon rules online retailing.
“The promise of Tesla was that at some point, all of the cars in the world would be electric vehicles, and Tesla would play a major role in that,” said Efraim Benmelech, a professor of finance at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.
But, he added, investors have since reassessed that view and now seem to think that traditional carmakers like Ford and General Motors will be able to pose a credible competitive challenge to Tesla.
“Some of those companies have been around for 100 years,” said Benmelech, who uses Tesla as a case study in his classes. “They have good engineers, good management. One should not underestimate the role that competition plays.”
Benmelech points out that by most standard measures, Tesla is doing pretty well. The company has reduced its debt and has some of the highest profit margins in the business. It reported a net profit of $8.9 billion in the first nine months of 2022, more than General Motors earned.
This week, there were signs that the share price was stabilizing. The shares rose to $123 Friday from a two-year low of $109 Wednesday.
Because many investors compare Tesla to technology companies, it must fulfill loftier expectations than more established automakers. That is why it is still worth roughly $389 billion, compared with about $226 billion for Toyota.
In retrospect, it is clear that Tesla’s stock market valuation of more than $1 trillion at the beginning of the year was overblown, analysts say. Some of the spectacular rise in Tesla’s share price in 2020 and 2021 was probably driven by investors hoping that the company would make them as rich as it had others who bought shares in the company in 2017 when it was worth $40 billion (and considered by some skeptics at the time to be wildly expensive).
“There are times when Tesla looked like it could make someone a millionaire in short order,” said William Goetzmann, a professor of finance at the Yale School of Management who studies asset prices.
That optimism became more difficult to sustain as a series of problems emerged during 2022. Temporary shutdowns at Tesla’s factory in Shanghai because of rising COVID cases, along with intense competition from BYD and other Chinese automakers, cast doubt on Tesla’s chances to dominate electric car sales in that country, the world’s largest auto and electric car market. The Shanghai factory is Tesla’s largest, accounting for 40% of its total production.
Tesla is expected to release its fourth-quarter and full-year car sales data in the next few days. Wall Street analysts are expecting the company to deliver 420,000 cars in the last three months of the year, up from 343,000 in the third quarter. That would be impressive but would not be enough for the company to meet the company’s goal of increasing sales by 50% for the full year.

Rising interest rates were a problem for all automakers, and especially companies like Tesla whose vehicles typically sell for more than $50,000. Higher rates mean higher monthly payments that many buyers cannot afford.
Even if rate increases by the Federal Reserve and other central banks were beyond Musk’s control, analysts faulted him for not paying enough attention to Tesla at a critical moment.

Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has long been optimistic about Tesla’s prospects, probably spoke for many investors when he suggested 10 things Musk could do to revive the company’s share price. High on the list: name a new CEO of Twitter and “focus attention back on Tesla, not on Twitter.”
Investors and analysts are divided on how much Musk’s utterances on Twitter have tarnished Tesla’s image among the left-leaning consumers most likely to buy an electric car. Even putting those concerns aside, Musk’s behavior has highlighted the lack of checks and balances at Tesla. The company’s board of directors, whose members include the CEO’s brother, Kimbal Musk, has largely been silent.
Last month, when several directors testified in a Delaware court in a lawsuit challenging Elon Musk’s giant compensation package, they said they were unconcerned about how much time the executive was spending at Twitter. “He will do whatever he needs to achieve the results,” Robyn Denholm, Tesla’s chair, said on the witness stand.
Tesla, Musk, Denholm and Kimbal Musk did not respond to requests for comment.
Len Sherman, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School who previously worked as a consultant to the auto industry, said Tesla’s board has been exceedingly deferential to Elon Musk.
“You have no effective governance to rein in his worst impulses,” Sherman said. “He runs his show the way he wants to run it, and no one can stop him.”
Sherman, who drives a Tesla and previously owned Tesla stock, is among those who have begun to question whether Musk is the right person to run the company as it becomes a mature carmaker. He noted that there had been no mention recently of plans to build a $25,000 car that would attract more customers and drive up sales.
“That’s not how you go from where Tesla is now to becoming the next GM or Volkswagen,” Sherman said. “For all his admirable traits, being the only human being on the planet to accomplish what he did, he’s not ideal for the kind of leader Tesla needs going forward.”

With its visionary leader seemingly disengaged, Tesla is being scrutinized according to more conventional standards like revenue and profits and less according to dreams of world domination.
“Now that the cars are ubiquitous,” Goetzmann of Yale said, “it had to make a transition at some time in its history to not being based on long-term prospects but on sales figures and things like that.”

Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion, and has begun suspending the accounts of journalists and others.Social media's disinformation problems only got worse. National security concerns continued to mount over TikTok, the Chinese-owned viral video app. And the entire cryptocurrency industry plunged into crisis.I spoke with The New York Times's technology editor, Pui-Wing Tam, about her takeaways from these major tech stories in 2022, and what she and her team will be paying attention to in the coming year. Here's our conversation, lightly edited:Let's start with crypto. Late last year, the Staples Center was renamed the Crypto.com Arena, seemingly a reflection of how much cryptocurrencies were dominating the business zeitgeist. But things feel very different a year later.The price of all of these coins had been going through the roof in 2021. NFTs had become super popular. Everyone was talking about crypto like it was the next big thing that was going to take over the world.Then in May this year, a popular cryptocurrency called Luna basically lost all of its value, which had a bit of a domino effect on the rest of the market because it exposed how fragile these so-called currencies really are. That led to some crypto companies filing for bankruptcy. And most recently, FTX, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, filed for bankruptcy last month. FTX owes about $8 billion to its customers. So all of that has very much been a wake-up call as to how real this industry is.Do you see crypto coming back from this?The industry is tremendously volatile. It rises like crazy, then it totally crashes. There's a bit of a pattern of this. But it's not going away. It's much more mainstream than it used to be, even though there are a lot of people who would never buy this stuff.Amazon , Meta, DoorDash, Lyft and many other companies announced layoffs this year. What's driving that?Tech had been one of the most resilient parts of the economy -- pandemic hiring had been through the roof. Then this year, as things slowed down, a lot of these tech companies said they had overexpanded during the pandemic and needed to correct that. That's sort of changed the tenor of what's going on in Silicon Valley.The caveat is that tech is still much bigger and more robust than it was a decade ago. So even though there's a slowdown, it's far from the end of the world for the tech industry. It's just a shift in growth and in expectations, and it's a bit more of a sober time, but tech is still humongous. It's still incredibly rich.Is there more to the economic slowdown beyond layoffs?Hiring is the most evident, but at Amazon, for example, they've decided to put the brakes on some of the expansion of warehouses. So these companies are looking at costs writ large -- it's not just people, it's expansion plans, experimental initiatives, property, etc.The epitome of that, obviously, is what Elon Musk has done at Twitter, where he's cut thousands of employees, more than 50 percent of the company's staff. He's just cutting costs left, right and center. I don't want to place it exactly in the middle of this tech slowdown story, because it obviously has its own dynamics. But if you look at what he's done, it's not that far off from other companies -- they're not making as severe a number of cuts, but they're making cuts.Speaking of Musk, is he going to continue to dominate tech news in 2023?Musk was definitely one of our big themes over the past year, and obviously a lot of that had to do with Twitter, but it also became much broader than that. It was about Starlink, Tesla, SpaceX -- he was sort of everywhere. He's upending the way that management of tech companies is being done. Of course we're going to be watching that -- and how he influences free speech -- going forward.For more:This week, Twitter suspended the accounts of roughly half a dozen journalists, as well as more than 25 accounts that track the planes of government agencies and billionaires -- including one that followed the movements of Musk himself.A tech industry trade association sued the State of California on Wednesday in an effort to halt a new children's online safety law.""Luddite"" teens don't want your likes.If you read one story, make it thisThe New York Times Magazine published a special project about child gun deaths.The rest of the newsU.C. strikes: Teams of striking U.C. graduate student workers are willingly getting arrested in acts of civil disobedience to push for higher wages, CalMatters reports.Rooftop solar subsidies: California regulators voted unanimously to significantly reduce how much utilities have to pay homeowners with rooftop solar panels for power they send to the electric grid.Drought: The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California declared a regional drought emergency as the state faces the potential of a fourth consecutive dry year, The Los Angeles Times reports.Southern California conservationists are also planning to install water stations in inland desert regions that are home to bighorn sheep, The Associated Press reports.""My Kevin"": Former President Donald Trump has been working the phones, personally pitching right-wing lawmakers on voting to make Representative Kevin McCarthy the speaker of the House.Fentanyl epidemic: Humboldt County had another record-breaking year in fentanyl overdoses in an epidemic that officials are struggling to contain and working to alleviate, The Lost Coast Outpost reports.Police misconduct: San Francisco Police Department officers who are accused of committing a variety of crimes have been working office jobs in the department, The San Francisco Standard reports.What we're eatingCheck out the most read food stories of 2022.Where we're travelingToday's tip comes from Victoria Edwards, who lives in Sierra Madre.

Ringo's mother struggled with addiction and her father was sick, so the girl was spending a lot of time indoors alone.She and Frumkes started hiking together in Marin, and sometimes the older woman would make cookies for them to share. ""I remember feeling the sun shining through the madrone or manzanita trees, the air smelling good, like fresh outdoor air,"" Ringo, now in her 30s, told The Mercury News. ""This person treated me like I had potential"" and ""like I was worthy of love and kindness.""But after Ringo's father died in 2001, she didn't see Frumkes again. Until this year.In August, Ringo, who is completing a doctorate in English at U.C. Davis, found an old photo of her and Frumkes together, but couldn't remember Frumkes's name to try to contact her. So she turned to Twitter, posting the photo and asking for help finding the woman in the picture. She had ""saved my life when I was an at-risk youth enduring extreme trauma and abuse,"" Ringo tweeted. ""I want to tell her thank you.""Within 24 hours, one of Frumkes's friends had spotted it and contacted Frumkes, who works as an executive assistant in Marin. When she saw the photo, memories of those times ""started flooding back,"" Frumkes said.The two women connected and spoke on the phone. The conclusion? ""Let's go for a hike.""Thanks for reading.

550,31-Dec-22,The Washington Post,These tech moguls lost a combined $433 billion this year,https://www.proquest.com/usnews/docview/2759509189/BFD812D457A14912PQ/341?accountid=13946,"Tech billionaires have lost hundreds of billions of dollars this year as stocks slid and many companies slowed their decade-long streak of constant growth.
It's been a dreary year for tech stocks - and also for the massive wealth buckets of the executives and founders whose net worths are so closely tied to their company's fortunes. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who once ranked in the top 10 richest people in the world, lost nearly $81 billion in net worth this year.
But the billionaires are far from destitute. Zuckerberg, for example, is still worth nearly $45 billion, or more than the GDP of Iceland. And several of the billionaires are actually worth more than they were in 2019, as the market's accelerated growth during the early phase of the pandemic padded their portfolios before their wealth plunges this year.
Tech stocks fell dramatically in 2022 as the pandemic sales bump that boosted many of them waned. Tech giants, which have grown at breakneck paces for the past decade, began hiring freezes and massive layoffs.
Not all tech executives felt the financial pinch this year. Chinese internet entrepreneur Zhang Yiming, founder of TikTok's parent company ByteDance, has seen his fortune rise by more than $10 billion to a net worth of nearly $55 billion. A few tech moguls in the United States suffered financial losses but to a lesser degree: Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, shed $16 billion this year but remains the seventh-richest person in the world; Michael Dell of Dell Technologies saw his net worth shrink by about $7 billion, keeping him just ahead of Zuckerberg on the list of the top 25 wealthiest people.
The broader markets also nosedived this year as investors and companies grappled with war overseas, rising inflation and interest rates and increasingly budget-strapped consumers. Billionaires who made their fortunes in non-tech industries also shaved fortunes from their net worths.
But some of the most significant drops have hit tech moguls. See how much several tech leaders lost this year:
Elon Musk

Total loss: $132B


Current net worth: $139B

Elon Musk lost $132 billion in net worth in 2022, a loss that exceeds the fortunes of each of the other wealthy men on this list.
The CEO of Tesla, SpaceX and Twitter was the richest person in the world for much of this year. But Musk, who holds much of his wealth in Tesla shares, lost that crown as Tesla stock spiraled downward, plunging nearly 70 percent throughout the year.
Tesla stock has felt the brunt of concern that demand for the electric vehicles is weakening in China, a major market for the company. Tesla also faced challenges tied to the rising cost of supplies to make the vehicles.
Some investors have also been wary about Musk's focus on Twitter. He sold Tesla shares to help fund his $44 billion takeover of the social media company, and his short reign at the helm of Twitter has been marked by upheaval. The turmoil has made some Tesla investors uneasy, and they've urged Musk to once again focus on the car company.
Jeff Bezos

Total loss: $84.1B


Current net worth: $108B

Jeff Bezos lost $84.1 billion this year as tech stocks tumbled from their stratospheric heights and Amazon shares plunged nearly 50 percent, marking one of its worst years ever on the market.
The founder and chairman of Amazon stepped down from his role as CEO last year, but he remains its largest shareholder.
Amazon grappled with high inflation and slowing growth, as the huge bump in sales it experienced during the coronavirus pandemic waned this year. The company has not been immune to layoffs hitting the tech industry, and it is in the process of cutting about 10,000 people from its corporate divisions.
Bezos is also the founder of space travel company Blue Origin and owns The Washington Post, which he bought for $250 million in 2013.
Mark Zuckerberg

Total loss: $80.7B


Current net worth: $44.8B

Mark Zuckerberg's net worth plunged nearly $81 billion this year. The Facebook founder slid from the sixth-richest person at the end of last year to No. 25, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
It's been a trying year for Facebook, which announced it was changing the name of its parent company to Meta last year. Zuckerberg, who still leads the company he founded as a college student, has orchestrated the company's shift to focus more on the metaverse, a take on an interconnected digital world.
Meta reported its first two quarterly revenue drops this year as the company faces increased competition from TikTok and other, smaller social media apps, and a tougher digital advertising environment. The company warned it planned to lose even more next year as it builds out the metaverse. Meta announced it planned to lay off 11,000 workers this fall as it sought to cut expenses.
Larry Page and Sergey Brin

Page Total loss: $44.6B


Brin Total loss: $43.4B


Page Current net worth: $83.8B


Brin Current net worth: $80.2B

Sergey Brin and Larry Page lost a collective $88 billion this year. The founders of Google and current board members of parent company Alphabet stepped away from their executive roles in 2019, but they still hold major sway over the business through a special class of voting shares. Page had served as chief executive while Brin was president of Alphabet.
In a punishing year for digital advertising, even industry giants such as Alphabet have not been spared. Alphabet has slowed its hiring and has shuttered its cloud streaming service for video games, Stadia.
Earlier this year, Brin filed for a divorce from his wife, although the ultimate financial breakdown of the split will probably remain out of public view, after the couple took steps to shield details of the breakup.
Bill Gates

Total loss: $28.7B


Current net worth: $109B

The entrepreneur, philanthropist and co-founder of Microsoft lost nearly $29 billion in 2022. Gates's roughly 20 percent fall nearly matches the decline of the S&P 500 this year, meaning the billionaire's losses have largely tracked with a broad barometer for the overall market and a gauge of the economy. In fact, he beat out the Nasdaq composite index.
Gates's investments are diversified, with large stakes in multiple companies, opulent real estate and huge swaths of farmland. But his most valuable single holding remains shares of Microsoft, which shrank by nearly 30 percent this year. While revenue for Microsoft's cloud services increased by 24 percent during the company's most recent quarter, sales for its Windows operating system fell by 15 percent. And Microsoft said it expects slowing growth for its cloud revenue next year, which sent Wall Street into selling mode.
The immensity and complexity of Gates's vast wealth played a notable role in the widespread interest in his divorce from Melinda French Gates last year.
Steve Ballmer

Total loss: $20.2B


Current net worth: $85.5B

The former chief executive of Microsoft and owner of the Los Angeles Clippers lost more than $20 billion this year as the tech giant's slide ate into his net worth.
Most of Ballmer's wealth is tied up in shares of Microsoft, where he served as CEO from 2000 to 2014. While the company has fared better than other tech titans that rely more on advertising and consumer spending, the Windows maker still shed more than a quarter of its value this year. In addition to forecasting slower cloud growth, Microsoft has warned investors that it expects weak PC sales to extend into next year, and advertisers pulling back on spending will diminish revenue for LinkedIn and search ads.
After retiring from Microsoft in 2014, he purchased the Clippers for $2 billion. He's shelling out even more money to build the league's premier arena, the Intuit Dome, outfitted with a 44,000-square-foot oval scoreboard and an abundance of toilets to reduce bathroom wait times during games.
