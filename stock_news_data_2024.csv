Smith,"The best jobs for introverts, according to new research—some pay over $100,000","If you're introverted, you might not want a job that requires constant meetings or working in large groups of people.

While some jobs might be more tailored to extroverts, dozens of high-paying roles allow introverts to leverage their natural tendencies and unique strengths.

Resume Genius recently curated a list of 15 high-paying jobs with strong job growth projections that are well-suited for introverts.

To compile the list, researchers looked at recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and O*NET Online and identified roles that are compatible with common introverted traits and preferences including creative thinking, deep engagement, autonomy and meaningful interactions. Then, Resume Genius picked out jobs that paid a minimum annual salary of $56,240 and had strong 10-year outlooks, according to BLS data.

Whether you're someone who prefers to work in quiet environments or simply want the flexibility to work independently, consider pursuing one of these careers:

1. Database architect

Median annual salary: $134,870

2. Software developer

Median annual salary: $127,260

3. Actuary

Median annual salary: $113,990

4. Information security analyst

5. Data scientist

6. Computer systems analyst

Median annual salary: $102,240

7. Mechanical engineer

Median annual salary: $96,310

8. Digital (UX) designer

Median annual salary: $63,520

14. Millwright

Median annual salary: $59,470

15. Graphic designer

Median annual salary: $57,990

While jobs in tech or finance are big draws for introverts, as these industries are conducive to introverted tendencies such as independent work and creative problem-solving, other non-tech roles are equally suitable for this personality type, Eva Chan, a career expert at Resume Genius, tells CNBC Make It.

That includes millwrights, who install, maintain and repair construction machinery, as well as occupational health and safety specialists, who conduct assessments and analyze data related to workplace safety.

""Introverts have a unique professional strength: when they need to learn something new, they're often happy to dive in and require little supervision or external help,"" Chan says. ""This capacity to self-start and carry out independent research not only distinguishes introverts from other personality types but also makes them highly valuable in any job that emphasizes autonomy and initiative.""

To land one of these roles, Chan recommends using ""introvert-friendly"" job search methods like networking online in forums or groups on LinkedIn and Slack that align with your interests and career aspirations.

When it comes to networking, introverts don't have to stretch too far outside of their comfort zone, Chan adds. Instead, you should focus on ""quality over quantity"" by looking for smaller, more intimate networking opportunities (like a one-on-one informational interview) with colleagues and industry peers, which can make it easier to forge genuine relationships.

You can also use your resume or cover letter to highlight specific instances where your independent actions at work led to tangible outcomes, such as solving a complex problem, innovating a process or contributing to a project's overall success.

Smith,Wednesday's analyst calls: Nvidia price target increases and an alternative trade for the '2nd wave of AI',"(This is CNBC Pro's live coverage of Wednesday's analyst calls and Wall Street chatter. Please refresh every 20-30 minutes to view the latest posts.) Analyst chatter on Wednesday featured Nvidia and another possible way to capitalize on the artificial intelligence craze. Several analysts raised their price targets on Nvidia after the company's GTC Conference, in which the chipmaker unveiled a new graphics processing unit. Elsewhere, Barclays reinstated coverage of Broadcom, noting the stock could be an alternative AI play. Check out the latest calls and chatter below. All times ET. 8:23 a.m.: Citi upgrades International Paper after new CEO named A new CEO could bring improvements to International Paper , according to Citi. The bank upgraded the packaging and paper products company on Tuesday to buy from neutral and raised its price target to $46 from $36, suggesting nearly 19% upside from Tuesday's close. International Paper on Tuesday named Andy Silvernail its new CEO, effective May 1. The stock popped 11% on the news.The company has been long burdened with an overly complex portfolio and has chronically underperformed, Citi analyst Anthony Pettinari said in a note to clients. ""While outgoing CEO Mark Sutton made major strides in simplifying IP's portfolio (White Paper spin, China/India/Russia exit, asset sales), we view the job as partly done. Mr. Silvernail is an outsider and a potential change agent,"" he wrote. Pettinari believes priorities include divesting underperforming assets and fixing its box business. He also expects Silvernail to address the performance gap with competitor Packaging Corp of America. — Michelle Fox 8:08 a.m.: Telsey Advisory Group upgrades Best Buy, sees more than 20% upside ahead Telsey Advisory Group upgraded Best Buy to outperform from market perform on Wednesday, a day after meeting with the retailer's management, including CEO Corrie Barry. The firm also hiked its price target to $95 per share from $85, suggesting nearly 23% upside from Tuesday's close. ""Our meetings with Best Buy increased our confidence in the business showing signs of stabilization and improvement after nine consecutive quarters of negative comps, as the replacement cycle kicks in,"" analyst Joseph Feldman wrote in a note to clients. In fact, Best Buy is already seeing positive comparables in select categories like laptops, he said. Product innovation is also on the rise, which should help attract consumers and fuel growth, he added. In addition, the company is being cautious on capital spending, he said. Shares of Best Buy added more than 2% in premarket trading. — Michelle Fox 7:57 a.m.: Citi upgrades Tencent Music to buy after fourth-quarter report Tencent Music Entertainment may have found a path to steady growth and a higher stock price, according to Citi Analyst. Alicia Yap upgraded the Chinese entertainment stock to buy from neutral after Tencent released its fourth-quarter results. Tencent's total revenue for the fourth quarter was down year over year, but its subscription business grew. ""We believe TME's steady/resilient subscription music business with expanding capabilities of music value chain and ramp-up of long-form audio and diversified use case scenarios across multi-channels/devices would support sustained growth outlook,"" Yap said in a note to clients. Those subscriptions are expected to continue to be the key driver for the business moving forward. ""For 2024, management is confident that the online music business will maintain solid growth with subscription services serving as a primary driving force while continuing to explore new opportunities in advertising and artist merchandise to grow the business,"" the note said. Citi hiked its price target on Tencent Music to $13 per share from $9. The stock closed at $11.04 per share on Tuesday. — Jesse Pound 7:43 a.m.: Mizuho names Chevron a top pick, highlights delayed acquisition of Hess as catalyst A delayed acquisition has opened up a good entry point for shares of Chevron , according to Mizuho. The bank maintained its buy rating on the multinational energy giant and called Chevron a top pick. Analyst Nitin Kumar also raised his price target to $200 from $195, implying a 28% increase from the stock's Tuesday closing price. Chevron stock has added 5% so far this year. Kumar noted that the stock began the year outperforming its peers due to strong fourth-quarter earnings, until the company filed its proposed acquisition of Hess. ""Since then the stock has underperformed peers by ~6% as investors are concerned whether the deal will be completed since XOM and its partners are moving to,"" he wrote. Kumar's base case assumption still shows the deal going through, just with a Sep 30 close date versus June 30. Additionally, the analyst expects total production for Chevron to grow at a compound annual growth rate of between 10% to 11%, assuming that the Hess acquisition closes at the end of the third quarter. He also sees the company's current net asset value as looking attractive. ""Although the HES acquisition is ~7% accretive to NAV in our opinion, we still see value in standalone CVX especially given the recent underperformance compared to peers,"" Kumar wrote. — Lisa Kailai Han 7:38 a.m.: Needham upgrades Carmax to buy Carmax could soon be the upswing once again as the used car market begins to look more like it did before the Covid pandemic, according to Needham. Analyst Chris Pierce upgraded the stock to buy from hold, saying in a note to clients that the used car market could be on the road to recovery after a rocky few years. ""We see potential for a multi-year recovery, with interest rate relief and rising used vehicle supply pushing down [average selling prices] and monthly payments. We are confident in our above-consensus FY25 and FY26 retail unit estimates, which assume KMX's share gains resume and its omni-channel investments pay off as units grow,"" the note said. And even with concerns about the U.S. consumer weakening, the Carmax loan book appears to be in good shape, Pierce said. ""KMX's December loan default commentary was a positive surprise, with higher value loans on higher ASP vehicles seeing elevated early defaults, but subsequently reverting toward expectations as the loans season,"" the note said. Needham set a price target of $99 per share for Carmax, which is about 22% above where the stock closed Tuesday. — Jesse Pound 7:34 a.m.: Chipotle shares can continue rising amid strong growth, Deutsche Bank says Deutsche Bank sees more room to run for Chipotle shares as the fast-casual Mexican chain continues growing. Analyst Lauren Silberman raised her price target by $200 to $3,300 per share, which now implies an upside of 18% over Tuesday's close. Silberman also reiterated her buy rating. In a note titled ""Guac Costs Extra and So Does Growth,"" Silberman said she has high conviction in the near-term and long-term growth outlooks for the stock. The analyst said a premium multiple is deserved, given that there's few high-quality U.S. companies with clean balance sheets, strong fundamentals and the potential to see upside to performance metrics. ""CMG has been among the best-performing restaurant stocks and we expect fundamental strength to continue to drive outperformance,"" she wrote to clients. Silberman also praised Chipotle for its visibility into the path to 30% on margins. Its ""best-in-class"" unit economics offer another quality to like, she said. On Tuesday, Chipotle said its board approved a 50-to-1 stock split . The change is expected to go into effect in June if approved by shareholders earlier that month. Shares of Chipotle rose more than 6% in Wednesday premarket trading. The stock has climbed more than 22% this year. CMG YTD mountain CMG year to date — Alex Harring 7:31 a.m.: Spotify shares could still gain nearly 25%, according to Bank of America Bank of America is increasingly confident in Spotify's long-term potential. The firm maintained its buy rating on the streaming company and also raised its price target by $50 to $315, which suggests shares could climb 24.6%. The stock has already jumped more than 35% this year. ""The company is now at an inflection point which is driving share price performance over the last ~18 months and we are confident in the sustainability of this momentum driven by: 1) subscriber growth, 2) monetization opportunities (e.g. price increases), 3) scaling of advertising driven in large part by podcasting, 4) continued operating leverage,"" analyst Jessica Ehrlich wrote in a Wednesday note, adding that first-quarter earnings should come out at least in line with guidance. Spotify is on track to see positive gross margins, operating income and free cash flow, according to Ehrlich. The company's free cash flow trajectory and strong balance sheet pave the way for it to initiate a share repurchase program, which could boost shares higher in the second half of this year, the analyst added. — Pia Singh 6:48 a.m.: JPMorgan upgrades bitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms, forecasts more than 35% upside Investors should look to bitcoin mining company Riot Platforms after the recent increase in bitcoin prices, according to JPMorgan. Although shares on Tuesday declined to their lowest level, $11.09, since the Securities and Exchange Commission's bitcoin ETF approval, analyst Reginald Smith remains optimistic and upgraded the stock to overweight from neutral. His $15 price target assumes a $60,000 bitcoin price and suggests 35.2% potential upside for the stock. Smith cited the Riot's decline as a result of the stagnant hashrate growth, equity dilution and broader industry profit taking. ""We like Riot's unique combination of industry-leading power contracts, scale and liquidity (Riot last reported ~$600M in cash and $470M worth of bitcoin), and think shares offer the best relative upside among the three largest and most liquid U.S.-listed mining stocks,"" Smith wrote in a Wednesday note. Riot shares are down more than 28% year to date. RIOT YTD mountain RIOT in 2024 — Pia Singh 6:23 a.m.: Citi downgrades Wells Fargo Citi downgraded Wells Fargo to neutral from buy, saying the bank's valuation has already priced in the potential for earnings per share revisions. Analyst Keith Horowitz raised his target price by $6 to $63, however, which implies the stock could gain 10.5% from Tuesday's close. Shares are up 15.8% year to date. ""We continue to see tailwinds from fixed asset repricing, growth across fee categories and improved efficiency, but our estimates are not too far above the Street. With WFC trading at a premium relative to peers on our implied cost of equity metric, we believe the risk/reward is fairly balanced,"" analyst Horowitz wrote in a Tuesday note, saying Wells Fargo has been one of his top picks among the G-SIBs, or global systemically important banks. — Pia Singh 6:03 a.m.: Netflix shares should 'trade at a premium,' according to KeyBanc KeyBanc Capital Markets thinks Netflix can grow consistently going forward. Analyst Justin Patterson maintained his overweight rating and upped his price target by $125 to $705, suggesting shares of the streaming giant could gain 13.6% over the next year. He also increased his earnings per share estimates for this year and 2024. ""We continue to see signs that: 1) Netflix's content quality is improving; and 2) in our view, this creates a clear catalyst path as engagement should drive a monetization ramp (both in price increases and ad revenue),"" Patterson wrote in a Tuesday, anticipating Netflix to have a more balanced growth between subscribers and monetization over the medium term. ""Given more recurring revenue, an emerging ad revenue stream, and consistent 20%+ EPS growth, we believe NFLX should trade at a premium to peers."" Netflix shares are up 27.5% so far this year. — Pia Singh 5:55 a.m.: Analysts think Nvidia is still a buy after GTC conference Several analysts remain bullish on Nvidia after the darling chipmaker's artificial intelligence GTC conference this week, during which CEO Jensen Huang gave a two-hour keynote speech about Nvidia's growing lineup of software and hardware products. Here's what some of them had to say: Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer raised his price target on the stock to $1,100, implying upside of 23%. ""Nvidia has transformed from a graphics company to a premier leading AI computing platform company. GPUs were initially used for graphics in video games and film. Given its parallel processing capabilities and thousands of computing cores, GPU are now optimized for deep learning AI algorithms in datacenters."" Piper Sandler hiked its price target to $1,050 from $850, noting: ""We view the new architecture as an expansion of the already dominant market positioning of NVDA's hardware offering. We maintain that NVDA is the leading company in offering the full hardware and software stack to address the decade long transition to accelerated computing and generative AI."" The new price target implies upside of 17.5%. Bank of America reiterated its buy rating and $1,100 price target, naming Nvidia a ""top compute pick"" following the conference. Blackwell's pricing should allow Nvidia to sustain mid-70% gross margins, and adoption of the new chips could be among the fastest in company history given its affordability across various customer bases, analyst Vivek Arya said. Nvidia shares closed at $893.98 on Tuesday. The stock — which is up 80.5% for the year — traded 0.2% lower in premarket trading. — Pia Singh 5:55 a.m.: Broadcom a strong play for '2nd wave of AI', Barclays says Looking for another way to capitalize on the artificial intelligence craze? Barclays thinks investors should look no further than Broadcom . The bank reinstated coverage of the semiconductor stock at an overweight rating. Its price target of $1,405 implies upside of nearly 14%. ""The company joins our preferred names this year as another way to play the 2nd Wave of AI via a best-in-class data center silicon portfolio,"" analyst Tom O'Malley wrote. ""In the near term, AI is all that matters and the custom silicon/switching businesses are driving a significant portion of near-term growth (we forecast a mid/high-20% range next year and for it to accelerate longer term)."" ""Outside of AI, the company is seeing many of the same cyclical downturns as Semi peers but a growing software business helps boost profitability and [free cash flow] generation,"" he said. Broadcom shares are up 10% year to date, lagging Nvidia — which has soared 80%. That said, Broadcom is outperforming the S & P 500's 8.6% gain.

3,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/06/northern-ireland-united-ireland-in-focus-with-sinn-feins-michelle-oneill.html,AOS,A. O. Smith,The prospect of a united Ireland emerges as a republican leader takes office in Belfast,"BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND - FEBRUARY 3: First Minister Michelle O'Neill speaks during proceedings of the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont on February 3, 2024 in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

LONDON — A referendum on Irish reunification could be in the cards within a decade, according to Northern Ireland's first-ever nationalist first minister, who took office at the weekend.

Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill was appointed as first minister on Saturday, the first Irish nationalist to hold the office since Northern Ireland was founded as a Protestant-majority state in 1921. The Democratic Unionist Party's Emma Little-Pengelly was appointed deputy first minister.

It came after the Northern Ireland Assembly, the country's devolved parliament, reconvened for the first time in two years on Saturday after the U.K. loyalist DUP reached a deal with the British government to end a boycott over post-Brexit trade arrangements.

The island to the west of England is divided in two; Northern Ireland is part of the U.K., whereas its neighbor, the Republic of Ireland, is an independent nation and a member of the European Union.

Until now, Northern Ireland's first minister has always come from a British unionist party, but Sinn Fein, which advocates for Northern Ireland to rejoin the Republic, won the most seats in the assembly for the first time in 2022.

The DUP, Northern Ireland's largest British unionist party, boycotted the assembly in February 2022 in protest over post-Brexit trade rules and refused to return for two years, leaving the country of 1.9 million people without a functioning administration. The deal that secured its return includes a contribution of more than £3 billion ($3.8 billion) from the British government for Northern Ireland's public services.

The power-sharing rules of the assembly, enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement — a landmark 1998 peace deal that brought an end to three decades of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland — mean that the executive, which runs the country, must include both unionist and nationalist representatives.",2/6/2024,1,0.012779332,0.800066769,0.005429716,0.158878878,0.020460995,0.002384289

While some investors have voiced their concerns over lofty valuations, Dunn, the co-head of value equity at Morgan Stanley Investment Management and a portfolio manager on the Eaton Vance Value team, told CNBC in a recent interview that he's been keeping an eye on Micron and Accenture . Both stocks represent businesses with good returns, he said. Micron benefits from the consolidation of the memory business, while Accenture is capital light. Accenture is profitable, while Micron is not too far behind. Dunn believes that semiconductor manufacturer Micron could benefit as demand for memory chips begins to outpace supply once again. ""With AI, you need more memory,"" he said. ""I think we're going to go back to a period where memory is tight, and Micron has really good new technology that's also going to soak up excess capacity."" In February, the firm announced that it had started production of its HBM3E, or High Bandwidth Memory wafer. These chips would be comparable with Nvidia's graphic processing units for AI capabilities, while also requiring less power and acting at higher speeds, Dunn said. Meanwhile, Micron could also be a beneficiary of the U.S.'s desire to have more of a domestic presence in the semiconductor chip market. ""Effectively, MU will be getting paid by the U.S. government to build in-country capacity,"" Dunn said. Shares of Micron have rallied 9% so far this year, but Nvidia has gained 77% over the same time period. The portfolio manger cautioned that while Micron shares have had a big runup — it's gained 77% since hitting a 52-week low last March — and may be at risk of a modest pullback, the stock's long-term fundamentals look to be very strong. MU 6M mountain MU 6-month chart Dunn also listed professional services firm Accenture as a potential AI beneficiary. Shares have added 7% so far this year, as of Friday's close. Accenture is likely to rally as firms begin to adopt AI and large language learning models into their business operations, Dunn said. ""Businesses will need help in understanding how AI should be used and the eventual implementation of those technologies,"" he said. ""Accenture is positioned to provide this. This is likely an inflection point for them that will define the intermediate trends for them.""

6,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/11/a-dreaded-death-cross-chart-pattern-points-to-even-more-losses-for-this-struggling-software-stock.html,ADBE,Adobe Inc.,A dreaded 'death cross' chart pattern points to even more losses for this struggling software stock,"Adobe showed all the technical characteristics of a top performer during the second half of 2023. After a key breakout in May of last year, ADBE pounded out a clear pattern of higher highs and higher lows, along with consistently strong momentum and impressive relative strength. But 2024 has been a dramatically different year, with almost every bullish factor listed above reversing to a more bearish reading. This week, ADBE flashed the dreaded ""death cross"" signal — a pattern that typically points to further downside — with the 50-day moving average crossing down through the 200-day moving average. Is this just the beginning of a protracted downtrend for this software name? The technical evidence would suggest further downside is very much a possibility. Adobe created a classic double top pattern in January, when the stock retested the December 2023 high around $630 and failed to break above this resistance level. Price momentum has shifted to a bearish range, with the relative strength consistently below 50 over the past two months. It's worth noting that the death cross observed this week happened only after the stock had established a clear downtrend of lower highs and lower lows. This sort of moving average technique is very much a lagging indicator, meant to confirm a downtrend that has already begun. In fact, the last time Adobe flashed a death cross was in January 2022. The stock was already down about 25% from its November 2021 high when the pattern appeared, and ADBE lost another 45% in value after that bearish signal. What downside objectives can we identify based on the current setup? Let's incorporate Fibonacci retracements as a way to anticipate potential support levels, assuming this downtrend continues. Now we can see that the gap lower in March, after the Q1 earnings release, dropped the price right down to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. This support level, just below $500, aligns well with the September 2023 price low. Although ADBE experienced a brief bounce higher after that downside gap, the bears regained control in recent weeks. Now that the first Fibonacci level has been broken, this would suggest further downside with potential support at the 61.8% level around $411, along with secondary support at the 50% level around $453. Back in 2022, a similar death cross resulted in an additional 45% drop for Adobe before the eventual low was established. While a repeat of that sort of extreme downtrend may seem unlikely, the bearish configuration of price action, moving averages, RSI, and relative strength suggests that investors should treat this stock as guilty until proven innocent. -David Keller, CMT marketmisbehavior.com DISCLOSURES: None THE ABOVE CONTENT IS SUBJECT TO OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND PRIVACY POLICY .

American semiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices has failed in getting a made-for-China AI chip past U.S. regulators and will need to apply for an export license, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

The report said AMD designed the chip to have lower performance than its premium products in order to comply with U.S. export restrictions. But Bloomberg reported the Commerce Department did not clear the chip for sale in China because it was still too advanced.

AMD will now have to obtain a license from the department's Bureau of Industry and Security, the report said.

It's not clear if the company will apply for the license. AMD and the Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.

While the U.S. has restricted sales of products containing the nation's most advanced semiconductor technologies to China, citing national security concerns, American companies have continued to sell mature or less advanced technologies to the massive market without licenses.

Intel has survived an effort to halt hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of chip sales to Huawei, two people familiar with the matter said, giving one of the world's largest chipmakers more time to sell to the heavily sanctioned Chinese telecoms company.

""No American company, especially those receiving taxpayer funding, should be fueling its innovation,"" he said, referencing Intel's expected grant from the Commerce Department to expand its U.S. chip production.

Republican Senator Marco Rubio called on the Biden administration to revoke Intel's license to sell to Huawei ""immediately"" following the Reuters report.

It has also allowed Huawei to keep a small but growing share of the global laptop market, while AMD was deprived of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of sales to the Chinese sanctioned firm, data showed.

Intel's ability to hang on to a license to sell chips while a rival could not obtain similar permission demonstrates the uneven and uncertain terrain companies face as the U.S. seeks to limit Beijing's access to sophisticated American technology, especially to a heavily sanctioned company like Huawei.

The push came from Intel rival Advanced Micro Devices , which argued it was unfair that it did not receive a license to sell similar chips to Huawei and from China hawks, who are seeking to stop all sales to the Chinese firm.

U.S. President Joe Biden has long been under pressure to revoke a license, issued by the Trump administration, that allows Intel to ship advanced central processors to Huawei for use in laptops.

Intel has survived an effort to halt hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of chip sales to Huawei, two people familiar with the matter said, giving one of the world's largest chipmakers more time to sell to the heavily sanctioned Chinese telecoms company.

Intel, Huawei, the Commerce Department and the White House declined to comment. AMD did not respond to a request for comment. Describing the curbs on Huawei as economic bullying,"" the Chinese Embassy in Washington urged the United States to ""stop overstretching the concept of national security"" to ""suppress Chinese companies.""

Huawei, a symbol of the years-long technology war between Washington and Beijing, was added to the trade restriction list by the Trump administration in 2019 over alleged sanctions violations. Huawei has previously denied wrongdoing.

Being added to that list usually bars U.S. suppliers from selling anything to the targeted company.

But in late 2020, just before former President Donald Trump left office, the Commerce Department granted some U.S. Huawei suppliers — including Intel — special permission to sell certain items to the telecoms equipment giant.

AMD applied for a license to sell similar chips in early 2021 after President Joe Biden took office but never received a response to its application, a source said.

Reuters could not determine why Intel was granted its license and AMD was not. But the impact on CPU chip sales to Huawei was immediate, with the share of sales of Huawei laptops containing AMD chips plunging from 47.1% in 2020 to 9.3% in the first half of 2023, an internal AMD presentation with data sourced to NPD and GfK showed.

Intel's share of sales of Huawei laptops containing its chips soared during the period from 52.9% to 90.7%, according to the presentation.

That left the two companies with upwards of a $512 million dollar ""estimated revenue discrepancy"" by early 2023, according to the presentation.

Circana, the company created last year from the merger of NPD and IRI, and GfK, which is now owned by NIQ, declined to comment.

The push to revoke licenses appeared likely to bear fruit last year when a government official said publicly that Huawei's licensing policy was under review and privately told companies the Commerce Department would fix the licensing discrepancy, sources said.

But by late last year, the agency had shelved plans to revoke licenses, without providing a reason, said a person familiar with the matter and a U.S. official, who stressed the plan could be revived at a later date.

Reuters could not learn why the Commerce Department shelved its plans to revoke Intel's license.

But the action came as Washington took pains to reset relations with Beijing, including reestablishing military-to-military talks, after a Chinese spy balloon's discovery in U.S. airspace last winter soured relations between the two superpowers.

Intel's license is expected to expire later this year, and is unlikely to be renewed, sources said. Meanwhile, Huawei continues to rely heavily on Intel chips for its laptops, its website shows.",3/13/2024,-2,0.089785464,0.690821767,0.004815103,0.162793934,0.047823217,0.003960425

SMCI 1Y mountain Super Micro Computer over the last year ""SMCI is very well positioned to serve demand from AI CSP's over the next few years, but serving enterprise AI infrastructure demand in the years after likely will be more competitive, particularly given more enterprise-focused IT hardware suppliers such as DELL and CSCO,"" Ng wrote, referencing cloud services providers. Super Micro Computer has grown to nearly $60 billion in market capitalization and is slated to join the S & P 500 later in March. The stock has more than doubled in the first eight weeks of the year, soaring more than 278% in 2024 after climbing 246% in all of 2023. That's why further upside looks limited. Among his reasons for no more than a neutral opinion, Ng highlighted that Super Micro Computer currently trades in line with Nvidia on a price-to-earnings basis. Beginning next year, he said, he expects revenue growth to slow to 51% from a 61% compound annual growth rate between 2021 and 2024.

Firms from Appaloosa Management to D1 Capital reduced or vacated positions in many popular 2023 stocks, locking in profits ahead of the new calendar year, recent securities filings show. The moves came after a stellar year for the sector in the wake of a crushing 2022. The S & P 500 Information Technology Index surged 49% in the past 12 months, boosted by optimism surrounding the introduction of artificial intelligence and the contribution it's expected to make to profits. Take a look at how Wall Street played the tech group in the final months of last year. Profit-taking in AI darling Nvidia Chipmaker Nvidia dominated investor enthusiasm in 2023, rallying 239% as market participants bet on its advanced AI processors. That share price appreciation inspired some investors to take profits before year-end. D1 Capital's Dan Sundheim zeroed out his more than $60 million position in the semiconductor stock during the fourth quarter, while billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller shrunk his position by nearly 30%. David Tepper's Appaloosa Management trimmed its stake by about 23%, while Phillippe Laffont's Coatue Management and Tiger Global's Chase Coleman sold about 5% and 13% of their respective Nvidia positions. Still, Nvidia shares rallied 14% in the fourth quarter, extending a 3% gain in the September quarter. The Jensen Huang-led chipmaker locked in the majority of its profits in last year's first half, but is already up 47% year to date. Nor was Nvidia the only semiconductor maker that hedge funds cut back on in the fourth quarter. Along with Nvidia, Tepper reduced stakes in Advanced Micro Devices , Intel and Qualcomm , while halving his position in Taiwan Semiconductor . Coatue slashed its holding in TSM, a semiconductor manufacturer and foundry by 87%, while Viking Global's Ole Andreas Halvorsen liquidated an entire stake in chip designer Arm Holdings , which went public in September. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF surged about 21% in the fourth quarter as the sector capped off its best year since 2009. Reducing exposure to the rest of Magnificent Seven Hedge funds also took profits in a handful of other popular Magnificent Seven stocks that helped power 2023's AI-fueled market rally. Google- and YouTube parent Alphabet was one. During the fourth quarter, shares rose about 7%, capping off a year when it climbed a total of 58%. The company spent the latter part of the year battling it out with Microsoft for the top chatbot and overcoming the perception that it had fallen behind in the AI race. Duquesne Family Office's Druckenmiller ditched a nearly $113-million stake in Alphabet and a roughly $19 million Amazon position, while Baupost Group's Seth Klarman reduced his Alphabet position by nearly a quarter. Coatue's Laffont slashed his stake in Alphabet Class A and Class C shares by 64% and 74%, respectively. Third Point's Dan Loeb also dumped an Alphabet position worth about $120 million , while paring back stakes in Amazon and Microsoft by about 10% ad 9%, respectively. The latter two, however, remained among Third Point's top three holdings at the end of the quarter, totaling more than $600 million each. D1's Sundheim reduced stakes in Microsoft and Meta Platforms by more than 62% and 26%, respectively, while Coatue cut about 9% of its Meta stake. D1 Capital's Microsoft sale brought the fund's stake to less than $242 million. The moves in Meta came in a quarter in which the Instagram owner surged 18%. The stock is already up 33% in 2024 after jumping 194% in 2023, with investors rewarding the social media provider's focus on efficiency. Viking Global sold its entire roughly $1 billion Microsoft stake and slashed its Amazon position by 44%, while Berkshire Hathaway trimmed its Apple stake. Corvex Management liquidated its position in the iPhone maker. Beyond the most prominent companies, hedge funds also made key reductions in other popular technology and semiconductor bets last quarter. Starboard Value's Jeffrey Smith , for example, reduced its stake in Salesforce by 11% after taking an activist stake in the software company in 2022, while Sundheim's D1 Capital sold out its entire position. Shares of Marc Benioff -led Salesforce have risen 10% this year after nearly doubling in 2023. Appaloosa's Tepper also reduced its stakes in Uber and Chinese technology giants Pinduoduo and Baidu , while liquidating entire stakes in Arista Networks and JD.com . Fresh bets on technology To be sure, a handful of hedge funds opened or raised their bets on some technology stocks even as they pulled back or exited positions in others. Alphabet was a new bet for a handful of hedge fund leaders, including Viking Global and Scion Asset Management 's Michael Burry. Burry, known for calling the subprime mortgage crisis, also opened a $4 million position in Amazon totaling more than $4 million, and a stake in Oracle . He also beefed up existing positions in China-based technology providers Alibaba and JD.com. D1 Capital's Sundheim also hiked positions in Amazon and Alphabet, while Druckenmiller amped up his Microsoft holding by 7%. Tepper increased the size of his positions in Microsoft and Amazon and established a new one in Oracle. Third Point's Loeb increased his bet on Meta Platforms, even as Tiger Global and Viking Global trimmed their positions. Elsewhere, Coatue opened fresh stakes in Salesforce, Apple and ServiceNow , while lifting his Netflix position by 14%. Away from Nvidia, Taiwan Semi and Arm, other semiconductor companies attracted new attention. Viking Global opened a fresh position in Advanced Micro Devices , and Coatue's Laffont expanded his holding in the chipmaker a hair and revealed a new bet on Intel. For his part, Tiger Global's Coleman lifted his holding in Taiwan Semiconductor by 48%, or about $94 million, while unveiling a more than $203 million position in Broadcom . — CNBC's Alex Harring and Yun Li contributed reporting",2/19/2024,-2,0.000840374,0.997372627,0.000438169,0.000562044,0.000287038,0.000499798

""We think this provider of server and storage solutions will be a beneficiary of AI-driven demand growth ( > 50% of revenues now tied to accelerators like GPUs),"" the analyst said. ""We believe the market for AI servers is much larger than is factored in Street models."" Recent stock performance notwithstanding, Nvidia, the leading provider of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) with 80% of the global market, dwarfs Super Micro.

SMCI 1Y mountain Super Micro Computer shares over the last year Super Micro popped 13% during Thursday's session, approaching $1,000 per share. The call from Bank of America comes amid a period of rapid strength for the maker of GPU server systems. Super Micro's already attracted the attention of the investing community, nearly doubling since reporting strong earnings at the end of January. Shares have more than tripled already this year year after soaring 246% in 2023. Despite the runup in the stock, Bank of America argues that investors may still be overlooking Super Micro's potential, citing its accumulating backlog and capacity expansion, and partnerships with Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel . ""We expect the market for AI servers to grow, on average, 50% CAGR over the next three years, vs. historical growth of the overall server market (5.5% CAGR over the past 17 years), and we expect Super Micro's revenue to grow even faster driving market share gain,"" Bhattacharya said, referrring to compound annual growth rates. SMCI YTD mountain Year to date stock performance Bank of America's price target reflected 18% upside from Wednesday's close and is the highest on Wall Street, according to FactSet. Super Micro already trades far above the consensus analyst price target of $683. Bhattacharya added that Super Micro's ability to build ""server technology from the ground up"" gives it a strategic boost. ""This allows it to develop the highest performing customized solution for clients,"" Bhattacharya said.

What's driving these astounding moves is a confluence of factors including a scarcity in shares, sudden retail investor enthusiasm and a potential short squeeze. That's all on top of a strong quarterly print and an ongoing frenzy for AI. ""That's just created this once-in-a-decade momentum,"" said Mehdi Hosseini, an equity research analyst covering the stock at Susquehanna International Group. The UK-based company, which designs and sells the instruction sets that allow customers like Apple , Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to develop chips, is up 64% since reporting results and nearly tripled since its public market debut in September. While the company posted robust results and guidance, analysts have cast doubt over the magnitude of recent stock moves, which include a 48% post-earnings rally and a 19% drop during Tuesday's session. The action's also driven up Arm's price-to-earnings ratio to 86 times on a next-twelve month basis, putting it at a premium to AI chip darling Nvidia. ""The numbers did come up, fundamentals did seem a little bit stronger than people thought, but does that warrant doubling the stock price? Probably not,"" said Needham analyst Charles Shi. ""There's a lot of other stuff that's not fundamentally driven going on here."" ARM mountain 2024-02-08 Arm since reporting earnings One key factor at play is the limited number of shares in the marketplace. SoftBank , which took the company public last year , owns 90% of outstanding shares and is barred from selling those shares until its 180-day post-IPO lock-up period expires in March. That's stifled supply and driven up a higher bid for shares. While the share demand problem may seem short-term, Ryuta Makino, a research analyst at GAMCO Investors, said there's no guarantee that SoftBank even sells those shares next month. In fact, he suspects that SoftBank may hold on to stock in a similar fashion to what it previously did with Alibaba . SoftBank may retain a majority of its stake as a ""strategic asset"" and ""poster child"" for its AI portfolio, he added. Retail traders getting involved Arm seemingly came out of nowhere to become one of the most popularly traded names among retail investors in recent sessions. It ranked as the fifth most highly traded name across stocks and ETFs over a recent five-day period, behind Nvidia, Tesla and Advanced Micro Devices , according to data from Vanda Research. Options activity is also on the rise, and suggests heightened bullish sentiment, the firm said. Then comes the whole short-interest predicament. The number of shares being sold short in Arm is up 26% since the start of February, according to data from predictive analytics firm S3 Partners. Traders typically buy shares short as a bet that the price of an asset will fall. Hosseini suspects that the recent activity in Arm could be a product of a short squeeze akin to 2021's meme stock craze, when a slew of heavily shorted companies surged as retail traders piled into the stocks and forced short sellers to cover their losses. The move typically fuels a stock rally and can lead to other market participants buying shares due to a fear of missing out. The unwavering excitement around AI that's driven an investing frenzy over the last year may also be a factor at play with Arm. Needham's Shi noted that while the company isn't a ""pure play"" AI trade, and offers very limited exposure to the theme, investors have grouped it into that bucket given its ties to several technology leaders. ""The narrative is in their favor because they keep talking about AI in their story,"" he added. ""But I think this is a part of the mania.""",2/15/2024,-2,0.000573388,0.996323109,0.00041141,0.000989993,0.000611867,0.001090223

""We are completely convinced the consequences will be extraordinary and possibly as transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years,"" Dimon said in his April 8 annual letter to shareholders. ""Think the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, computing and the Internet, among others.""

JPMorgan Chase began using AI over a decade ago, Dimon said in the letter. The firm employs over 2,000 AI and machine learning experts and data scientists and uses the technology across a number of divisions, including marketing, fraud and risk. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase invests $12 billion annually in a wide variety of technologies, including AI.

Dimon likening AI innovation to the invention of the internet suggests the tech's impact may be felt beyond the business world. And he's not alone in that opinion.

In May 2023, billionaire investor Mark Cuban told CNBC Make It that the potential impact of tools like OpenAI's viral AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT are ""beyond anything I've ever seen.""

18,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/the-fcc-is-investigating-amazon-over-the-alleged-marketing-and-sale-of-outlawed-products.html,AMZN,Amazon,The FCC is investigating Amazon over the alleged marketing and sale of outlawed products,"The Federal Communications Commission said Wednesday that it is investigating Amazon and other retailers for the alleged marketing and selling of unlawful electronic devices, including radio frequency jammers.

The Federal Communications Commission said Wednesday that it is investigating Amazon and other retailers for the alleged marketing and selling of unlawful electronic devices, including radio frequency jammers.

The FCC does not always disclose ongoing investigations. It did so in a statement to NBC News after the news organization reported that some retailers and drone technology companies were marketing jammers online, despite FCC warnings that jammers are illegal.

""We have several ongoing investigations into retailers, including Amazon, for potential violations of Commission rules related to the marketing and sale of equipment without proper FCC authorization,"" FCC spokesperson Jonathan Uriarte said in the statement. He said he had no further details to share immediately.

NBC News reported earlier Wednesday that a variety of companies were marketing signal jammers online. They included Amazon third-party sellers, separate online stores based in China and small domestic companies that specialize in drone-related equipment.

Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday regarding the FCC's statement about its investigations.

Jammers have many possible uses, including to keep away unwelcome drones, disable security cameras and block Wi-Fi networks.

But they can also interfere with emergency communications, normal phone use and critical infrastructure such as airport navigation systems, according to the FCC and outside experts. The FCC says the manufacture, importation, sale or offer for sale of jamming equipment violates the Communications Act of 1934. Not even local police are allowed to use them.

NBC News found nine independent sellers on Amazon recently offering ""jammer"" devices for sale. All nine product listings disappeared from Amazon within two days after NBC News contacted the Seattle-based retailer. Amazon confirmed in an email earlier this month that its policies prohibit jamming devices and said it continuously monitors its marketplace to prevent third-party sellers from listing banned products.

Amazon did not offer an explanation for how the nine sellers got past the company's monitoring.",3/21/2024,-1,0.0106056,0.009475088,0.001058731,0.863019049,0.114586934,0.001254587
19,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/26/ford-falls-amazon-advances-pharmacy-pursuits-and-disney-board-member-speaks-our-takes-the-news.html,AMZN,Amazon,"Ford falls, Amazon advances pharmacy pursuits and Disney board member speaks – our takes the news","Ford Motor kept its 2024 guidance unchanged Tuesday. Meanwhile, Amazon 's pharmacy efforts added another wrinkle and Disney 's newest board member weighed in on the proxy fight underway at the entertainment giant. Here's a closer look at these headlines and our takes on each. F YTD mountain F stock performance year-to-date. The news: Ford CFO John Lawler on Tuesday reiterated the company's 2024 operating guidance at the Bank of America Securities Auto Summit. Ford still expects to earn between $10 billion and $12 billion in adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT; generate adjusted free cash flow between $6 billion and $7 billion; and spend between $8 billion and $9.5 billion on capital expenditures — just as the company offered in early February alongside its 2023 fourth quarter results earlier this month. Club take: Shares of Ford were hit hard Tuesday, falling 3.6%, even though rival General Motors advanced 1% in the session. The divergence in stock performance was not great to see. At the time Ford first issued its guidance, we perceived it as upbeat. The fact it was reiterated Tuesday suggests management's efforts to cut about $2 billion in costs are on track, and its scaled-back EV investments and intensified focused on hybrids are going as planned. Indeed, Ford's February sales figures showed plenty of momentum in the hybrid market. Ford got back on track with its February earnings report, but going forward we still need to see consistency in profits, cash flows and quality control, while managing losses in its electric vehicle division. Following Ford's fourth-quarter earnings print, we raised our price target on Ford shares to $15 from $13. ""It's time for Ford to break out,"" Jim Cramer said in Monday's Homestretch. Investors are set to get another update on Ford's business strength April 24, when the automaker reports its 2024 first quarter numbers after the close. AMZN YTD mountain AMZN stock performance year-to-date. The news: Amazon on Tuesday launched same-day delivery of prescription medication for customers in New York City and the greater Los Angeles area. The service — offered through Amazon Pharmacy launched in 2020 — is part of the company's efforts to provide ""the fastest and most convenient service for the home delivery of prescriptions,"" said Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, in a press release. Medications for flu, diabetes and other common conditions are available through the service, Amazon said. To help offer the swift delivery, Amazon said it is leveraging artificial intelligence ""to help pharmacists fill prescriptions quickly and accurately."" The e-commerce giant plans to expand same-day medicine delivery to more than a dozen cities by year-end. The service has been available to customers in Seattle, Miami, Indianapolis, Phoenix and Austin, Texas. Club take: Amazon's expansion of same-day delivery of prescription medication is another sign of the company's focus on innovating in health care. And we're always encouraged by efforts to boost the value of a Prime subscription. Financially, Tuesday's announcement is not really a needle mover. Nevertheless, the ability to offer same-day delivery for prescriptions spotlights Amazon's logistics and delivery prowess. For its traditional e-commerce business, the company has wisely streamlined its fulfilment network to reduce delivery times and overall cost of delivery, helping it make more money. In general, we feel good about our Amazon position, particularly in light of its relationship with Nvidia on AI, as Jim detailed in his Sunday column . DIS YTD mountain DIS stock performance year-to-date. The news: The newest member of Disney's board, Morgan Stanley Executive Chairman James Gorman, offered his perspective on the entertainment company's proxy fight in an interview with CNBC. ""A lot of this fight seems to be looking backwards. I'm more interested and why I joined the board in looking forwards,"" Gorman said. His comments come ahead of Disney's annual meeting, set for April 3, where Trian Partner's Nelson Peltz is seeking a board seat along with former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo. When pressed with Disney's stock underperformance against the broader market and its competitors in recent years, Gorman's justification was the ""period of major disruption in this industry"" from linear to streaming while navigating through the challenging post-pandemic environment. With CEO Bog Iger back at the helm, the company is ""turning that around. Its evidenced by the performance in the stock,"" Gorman explained. Shares of Disney are up nearly 33% year to date, but the stock has dramatically underperformed the S & P 500 over a five-year period. In that time frame, its cumulative total return is 9.7% compared with 100.2% for the S & P 500, according to FactSet. Club take: We've been supporting Peltz in his push to have two seats on Disney's board. We believe Peltz will be critical in creating shareholder value and reviving losses in Disney's underperforming businesses given his governance experience at consumer companies over the years such as Procter & Gamble , Wendy's , Heinz , and Unilever . In our minds, the pressure Peltz has been putting on Disney through this proxy battle has already helped motivate management and contributed to the stock's strong performance lately. Shares of Disney made a new 52-week high Tuesday and closed at just under $120 apiece. As discussed on Monday's Morning Meeting, we would consider trimming our position if we weren't restricted, given the stock's year-to-date gains. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long F, AMZN, DIS.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy loves to talk about how much his company is benefiting from the artificial intelligence boom. On Wednesday, Amazon got an AI boost in a different way.

Shares of Astera Labs , which sells data center connectivity chips to cloud and AI infrastructure companies, soared 72% in their Nasdaq debut, closing at $62.03. That gives Astera a market cap of close to $9.5 billion.

Astera's IPO plays into Wall Street's thirst for all things AI. Founded in 2017 by former Texas Instruments executives, Astera counts Nvidia , AMD , and Intel among its customers. It's also selling heavily to Amazon.

The company got a major vote of confidence in 2022, when it struck a deal with Amazon that gave the tech giant warrants allowing it to buy up to 1.5 million shares of Astera's stock at $20.34 apiece. The following year, the agreement was amended, giving Amazon a warrant to buy more than 830,000 additional shares. As of the end of last year, Amazon controlled 232,608 shares, according to a securities filing.

Based on Wednesday's closing price, Amazon's shares and warrants are worth a total of almost $144 million.

But in order for Amazon to vest the rest of its shares and fully benefit from the price pop, it must purchase up to $650 million worth of Astera's products in the coming years, according to the agreement. That's a lot of money for Astera, which recorded total sales last year of $115.8 million, up from $79.9 million in 2022.

The three types of products Amazon has agreed to buy are are all designed to address ""critical bottlenecks in AI infrastructure,"" according to Astera's IPO prospectus.

Astera is joining the public markets as investors eagerly await social media company Reddit's planned New York Stock Exchange debut Thursday. The tech IPO market has been largely dormant since late 2021, with Arm Holdings , Instacart and Klaviyo among the very few that have held offerings over that stretch.

Woo is a 42-year-old ex-corporate consultant and Montessori school administrative director who lectures at the University of California, Irvine, runs an online emotional intelligence course and freelances as a business consultant.

She also has a side hustle called Mind Brain Emotion where creates emotional intelligence-focused card games — 11 of them so far, on topics ranging from relationship skills to job interviews — and sells them on Amazon. The games brought in $1.71 million in revenue last year, or an average of $142,700 per month, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.

The side hustle's success is due, at least partially, to a three-step process Woo followed, she says: Keep testing your idea after you've launched it, use the feedback to inform your next project and repeat the cycle.

DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to earning passive income online

Woo's first game was meant to help teachers and kids learn the basics of emotional intelligence, so she spent three months testing it in local schools before listing it on Amazon, she says. Once sales started coming in, she kept researching and testing the game — but instead of updating it, she used the feedback to create new versions for different topics and audiences.

Donaldson's past videos range from trapping himself in solitary confinement for seven days, attempting to destroy a Lamborghini with a train and running his own version of Squid Game.

Donaldson said in an interview on ""The Colin and Samir Show"" podcast that his videos on YouTube can cost between $4 million and $5 million each, and the new show will have an even bigger budget. News outlet Puck estimated the deal between Donaldson and Amazon to be about $100 million.

""It's like our normal videos, but just 20 times better,"" Donaldson said on the podcast. ""Money's not a constraint on the show. And so I can also just do anything, which is like a lot more freeing than you would think and so mind-blowing.""

Donaldson said that working with a streaming service allows him to break free of the algorithms and values that perform better on YouTube like thumbnails, video length and title. However, MrBeast videos can net between 300 million and 500 million views each, and there are only 80 million active Amazon Prime Video households in the U.S., per Amazon.

""Beast Games"" is not the first time a creator has made content for a streaming service, and the news is part of a trend of creators expanding their content beyond social media platforms in order to diversify revenue. YouTube group ""Sidemen"" released a Netflix documentary earlier this year, for instance, and the family of TikToker Charli D'Amelio just aired the third season of their reality show on Hulu.

""We're reinventing everything,"" Donaldson said on the podcast. ""This will probably be six-plus hours of content, where my normal videos are 20 minutes long. The character building, the storytelling, will be out of this world compared to our normal videos.""",3/18/2024,-1,0.005405436,0.955468893,0.002336679,0.027916329,0.007127076,0.001745687

The "" Big Spring Sale ,"" which starts Wednesday and runs through March 25, is expected to ""drive stronger growth and defend its [Amazon's] competitive position,"" analysts at JMP Securities wrote in a note to clients. Bank of America estimates it could provide some upside to revenue for the quarter ending March 31, with incremental gross merchandise volume of $1 billion to $2 billion. Zev Fima, an analyst at the Investing Club, says a sales event on its own isn't a reason to buy the stock. ""But we agree that any increase in volume is going to help margins because fixed costs are going to be spread out over more units, therefore increasing operating leverage,"" he said. The inaugural event, which is not restricted to Prime members, will feature daily deals for all customers, with spring fashion, fitness products, and outdoor furniture among the categories that will be discounted. Prime members, who pay $139 per year, or $14.99 a month, in the U.S., will enjoy exclusive access to special deals. Fima said the sale is likely to add more Prime subscriptions, which include free, fast shipping, video streaming, and access to Prime Day deals. Despite scheduling the event during a slower retail period, Bank of America said it could be a move to get ahead of the competition for selling spring products. The firm said Amazon is interested in increasing its share in the home goods category. Amazon assured customers can ""shop confidently"" and rely on the company's swift delivery service during the sales event. This spring sale mirrors the two-day Prime Big Deal Days event Amazon hosted in October 2023 to kick off the holiday shopping season. This spring event comes during an uncertain economic environment. Retail sales had a modest 0.6% growth in February after falling 1.1% in January. The lower-than-expected increase shows consumers have become more cautious with their spending. Adjusted for seasonal variation, spending at health and personal care stores dipped 0.3% for the month, while shopping at clothing stores dropped roughly 0.5%. To be sure, consumers have some wiggle room for discretionary purchases and spending on experiences. Electronics purchases and spending at restaurants and bars rose 1.5% and 0.4%, respectively, from January to February. However, it's worth noting that retail sales are not adjusted for inflation , which increased 0.4% in February. Increases in both energy and shelter costs accounted for more than 60% of the monthly increase in the consumer price index for all items, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With this uncertain economic environment, Amazon said it will be offering up to 50% off select items including beauty products, electronics, apparel, and home products. A key factor for Amazon's success will be the company's regionalization strategy , which has not only increased shipping speed while driving costs down but has also led to market share gains. Amazon last year reached the fastest delivery speeds ever globally, with more than seven billion units arriving either the same day they were ordered or the next day. Management plans to get even faster in 2024 as it prioritizes efficiency in its fulfillment network while utilizing artificial intelligence to better predict which fulfillment center items should be placed according to customer demand. Amazon management said it will further reduce costs, allowing it to reinvest in speed improvements, lower prices, and improve profitability. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AMZN.

Amazon will host a spring sale next week with discounts on seasonal items, and this one is not restricted to Prime members.

Amazon said Thursday that the event, which it's calling the ""Big Spring Sale,"" will run for six days starting March 20, in North America. Unlike the Prime Day discount bonanza typically held in the summer, next week's event will be open to shoppers who don't pay for a Prime membership. The subscription program costs $139 per year, or $14.99 a month, in the U.S., and perks include free, speedy shipping; video streaming; and access to exclusive Prime Day deals.

Spring fashion, fitness products, outdoor furniture, Amazon-branded devices and other ""warm weather essentials"" are among the categories that will be discounted, Amazon said. It's the first time Amazon has held such an event in the first quarter.

In recent years, Amazon has added shopping events, including a ""Prime Big Deal Days"" in the fall, a 48-hour ""Pet Day"" and a beauty-focused sale ahead of the holiday shopping season.

The company is launching its spring event as shoppers, grappling with high inflation, remain hungry for discounts. Inflation has receded from its 40-year highs in mid-2022, but it remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% goal. Consumer prices rose more than expected last month, increasing 3.2% in February from a year earlier, the U.S. Department of Labor said Tuesday.

Amazon also faces rising competition from low-cost retailers Temu and Shein, which have been on an ad-spending blitz to attract American shoppers. Shein mostly offers deeply discounted apparel and accessories. Temu is akin to an online flea market and has seen its popularity boom due to its rock-bottom prices and a gamified shopping experience.",3/14/2024,1,0.028080754,0.568495452,0.004927522,0.336399615,0.060062181,0.002034456

Just before midnight on May 4, 2023, police were called to an Amazon warehouse in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to investigate a reported theft. They were met by a loss prevention employee, who directed them to a warehouse worker named Noah Page, the suspected culprit, according to a police report of the incident that was obtained by CNBC. When confronted by police, according to the report, Page admitted that he'd marked a customer's order in Amazon's internal system as returned even though the products were never actually sent back to the company. Page received $3,500 for his part in the scheme, the report said. Page didn't know the customer but had chosen to call him ""Ralph,"" the report said. Ralph, it turned out, was part of a group named Rekk, an expansive refund fraud organization that targeted major retailers and recruited company employees by promising them a cut of the profits, Amazon alleged in a lawsuit. Refund fraud, which involves tricking retailers into refunding a customer for a purchase without an item being physically returned, has become so pervasive that groups now market their services on Reddit, TikTok and Telegram. Type in ""refund method"" — or ""r3fund,"" to skirt content moderators — on TikTok and videos will pop up of users showing off piles of cash, sneakers and iPhones. One video has the caption, ""me after realizing you can get a refund on any Rick Owens if the 'package never came,'"" referring to the minimalist fashion brand. The clip shows a hand endlessly tossing shoes to the ground. Fraud groups are taking advantage of retailers' lenient return policies, experts told CNBC, which often include unlimited free returns and sometimes even a preference that customers keep the items. It's ballooned into a massive problem for retailers, costing them more than $101 billion last year, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation and Appriss Retail. The figure includes multiple forms of fraud, such as sending back clothing after it's been worn, known as ""wardrobing,"" and returning shoplifted merchandise, the survey said. In December, Amazon filed a lawsuit against Page and 47 other people across the globe with alleged ties to Rekk, accusing them of conspiring to steal millions of dollars worth of products in a refund fraud operation. Amazon described these services as ""illegitimate 'businesses'"" that look to ""exploit the refund process for their own financial gain to the detriment of honest consumers and retailers who must bear the brunt of increased costs, decreased inventory, and service disruption that impacts genuine customers."" Amazon also suffered more than $700,000 in losses at the hands of another alleged fraud ring in which 10 people were indicted last year, according to documents from a suit filed in 2023.

An Amazon spokesperson said the company is addressing the issue ""head on"" through specialized teams and machine learning tools that detect and prevent refund fraud. Amazon says its work with law enforcement has led to arrests, the dismantling of organized retail crime groups and civil lawsuits. ""We continue to make progress in identifying and stopping fraud before it happens, as well as dismantling the groups that attempt to damage the integrity of our store and the stores of retailers across the retail industry,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. Here's how it works: A shopper buys a product online and sends the order information to a group such as Rekk, which then poses as the customer in requesting a refund. Amazon refunds the money to the customer, who then pays the fraud group usually between 15% and 30% of the refund amount, often via PayPal or with bitcoin . That means the customer ends up buying the product for what amounts to a huge discount. The fraud group then pays the conspiring employee at the retailer, typically a certain amount for a batch of packages the employee scans as returned. Retailers and law enforcement agencies are catching onto the trend. In September, a 25-year-old man in Michigan, Sajed Al-Maarej, was arrested and charged with conspiracy, wire fraud and mail fraud after he allegedly ran a return fraud service called Simple Refunds that targeted more than 50 retailers. The following month, 10 men were indicted in Oklahoma, and charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud for allegedly operating a refund fraud service named Artemis Refund Group. And a 24-year-old U.K. man was convicted of fraud in December after running the KeptSecrets refund service, which targeted retailers including Amazon, Walmart and Wayfair , according to court documents. Following the Rekk scheme, Page was arrested when police showed up at the Chattanooga warehouse in May, and he was charged with theft of property worth more than $60,000. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced in November to three years of probation, as well as ordered to pay Amazon $5,000. Page didn't respond to requests for comment.

A thriving refund fraud market

For every refund fraud service shut down by law enforcement, swarms of similar groups remain open for business. CNBC viewed several active refund fraud services on encrypted messaging app Telegram, each with thousands of followers. Updates are posted almost daily of new stores on their services, or new retailers that have been successfully targeted. Amazon and Apple are frequently hit, along with Nike, eBay, Saks Fifth Avenue and Ralph Lauren. Some groups even offer their services for DoorDash and Uber Eats orders, claiming users can ""eat for free."" The groups are highly organized and run like businesses, providing customer service, cataloging orders and creating fake shipping labels. Some sell how-to guides.

Fraudsters employ multiple strategies. A common one is to claim a package never arrived so that the retailer issues a refund. According to Amazon's lawsuit, a Rekk user received a full refund for two MacBook Air laptops after filing a police report falsely claiming the products never arrived. Mail-in fraud involves a user filling out a company's return form, but instead of sending back the purchased product, users will mail an empty box or a package filled with junk. In the case of Simple Refunds, Al-Maarej, the man who allegedly operated the group, sent an unnamed retailer ""an envelope filled with plastic toy frogs"" instead of the tools he claimed he was returning, prosecutors said. Al-Maarej also recruited employees at UPS and the U.S. Postal Service who either manipulated a package's tracking history or input false ""return to sender"" notices to fool the retailer into thinking an item couldn't be delivered or that it was sent to the wrong address, according to court documents. Chris Black, an attorney for Al-Maarej, declined to comment. Amazon said its own internal investigation identified Al-Maarej's scheme and contributed to the eventual indictment. The company didn't respond to questions specifically about how it monitors and handles bribery of its employees by ORC and refund fraud groups. Rekk allegedly used bribes, offering Amazon staffers thousands of dollars a day to approve customer returns for products that were never sent back. In a text message last year to Page, a Rekk representative said they'd been working with two other Amazon employees for about two months and offered them $4,000 for 30 orders marked as returned, according to court documents. ""They usually do 30 scans per day per shift,"" the Rekk user wrote. ""Sometimes they choose to do more. So at least 12k a week."" According to the complaint, Rekk also recruited one of Page's colleagues at CHA1, Amazon's name for the Chattanooga facility. Between February 2023 and May 2023, the CHA1 employee allegedly approved product returns for 76 orders at Rekk's request, causing Amazon to refund over $100,000 to customers, and netting $3,500 from the scheme.

Amazon said it has tried to address the bribery problem. In its lawsuit against Rekk, the company said it has an internal customer protection and enforcement team made up of attorneys, former prosecutors, and analysts investigating organized crime schemes such as refund fraud. The company has also reportedly fired employees who were allegedly bribed to leak confidential data on third-party sellers. Cyril Noel-Tagoe, a cybersecurity expert who has studied refund fraud extensively, said the economic incentive for low-wage workers to get involved with these schemes creates a perpetual challenge for retailers. ""If you're offering an employee much more than they're getting paid, then it's quite hard to combat that,"" Noel-Tagoe, who works as a principal security researcher at bot detection software company Netacea, told CNBC.

'All you need is a phone'

Those on the lookout for moneymaking opportunities will find no shortage of promotional videos across social media. For a fee, you can learn how to play the game. One TikTok video on the topic shows bags of Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Apple products and reads, ""[Point of view]: You mastered the art of r3funding and started to teach others."" TikTok clips often serve as advertisements for a user's Telegram channel that's linked in the bio of their account. Similar tactics are used on Reddit. In the ""Illegal Life Pro Tips"" forum on Reddit, which is no longer active but counts 1.1 million members, refund scammers shared their tips and tricks. In recent days, Reddit banned an offshoot of that subreddit, called ""illegallifeprotips2,"" saying it violates the site's rules ""against transactions involving prohibited goods or services."" Users quickly resurfaced on a new subreddit, ""ELegalLifeProTips."" After CNBC flagged ""ELegalLifeProTips,"" Reddit took down the subreddit for violating its ban evasion policy. In the past, such illicit behavior ran rampant on the dark web and required VPNs and a special browser, said Brittany Allen, a trust and safety architect at fraud detection software company Sift. These days the perpetrators regularly discuss their activities openly on forums and in messaging apps, which Allen described as the ""democratization of fraud."" ""You don't need to be that specialist that can figure out how to find these deep web groups,"" Allen said. ""All you need is to have a phone that can go to Reddit, or a TikTok account you're already on, and you'll potentially be exposed to fraud that doesn't take as much uplift to participate in."" Remi Vaughn, a spokesperson for Telegram, told CNBC in an email that the company moderates ""harmful content"" on its platform, including posts that promote fraud. ""Moderators use a combination of proactive moderation on public parts of the platform and accept user reports in order to remove content which breaches Telegram's terms,"" Vaughn added. A Reddit spokesperson said it uses a combination of automated tooling and human moderators to enforce its content policies, which prohibit users from soliciting or facilitating any transaction that involves fraudulent services. After CNBC provided TikTok with examples of videos about refund fraud, the company said it removed them for violating its community guidelines. It said it also blocked hashtags that were used to promote refund fraud. The use of mainstream apps in these schemes has made it easier for investigators to do their work. Noel-Tagoe referenced a case in which a retailer was able to track down an individual whose email address was in an Instagram post. Allen said she's been able to identify fraudsters through ""vouches,"" or screenshots of successful fraudulent returns. Some of the images show order numbers, store pickup locations or cart items, according to Allen, all useful intel for retailers investigating return fraud. David Johnston, vice president of asset protection and retail operations at the National Retail Federation, said an increasing number of companies are ""tightening up their return policies"" in response to customer abuse and fraudulent activity. Delivery workers, for example, are encouraged to photograph a package once it reaches its destination, and retailers are looking more closely for suspicious behavior in analyzing returns. ""There are some retailers that monitor the number of returns you make in-store, and if you return too much too frequently, they might put you on pause,"" Johnston said. ""We're starting to see more of that now on the e-commerce side.""

Outstanding student loan debt in the U.S. exceeds $1.6 trillion, and burdens Americans more than credit card or auto loan debt. The average loan balance at graduation has tripled since the 1990s to $30,000 from $10,000. Additionally, about 7% of student loan borrowers are now more than $100,000 in debt. Voters support forgiving at least some student loan debt by a 2-to-1 margin, according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll. Less than a third oppose the policy. Here's what the GOP presidential contenders say about student debt forgiveness.

Former President Donald Trump has a long record of opposing debt cancelation. Trump also sided with the Supreme Court in its ruling striking down Biden's plan. ""Today, the Supreme Court also ruled that President Biden cannot wipe out hundreds of billions, perhaps trillions of dollars, in student loan debt, which would have been very unfair to the millions and millions of people who paid their debt through hard work and diligence; very unfair,"" Trump said at a campaign event in June 2023.

Ron DeSantis

Vivek Ramaswamy

In a written statement to CNBC last summer, the tech entrepreneur said America had a bad habit ""of paying people to do the exact opposite of what we want them to do: More [dollars] to stay at home than to work, more [dollars] to be a single mother than married, more [dollars] for those who fail to repay loans than those who do."" Ramaswamy added that the Supreme Court's ruling to block forgiveness ""helps reverse that trend.""

Nikki Haley

The former South Carolina governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under Trump tweeted last June that ""a president cannot just wave his hand and eliminate loans for students he favors, while leaving out all those who worked hard to pay back their loans or made other career choices."" ""The Supreme Court was right to throw out Joe Biden's power grab,"" Haley wrote.

Utilities, favored by income investors for their steady dividend payments, dropped more than 10% in 2023. The Federal Reserve's rate-hiking regime was a key culprit, as rising interest rates increase refinancing costs for utilities. They also made the stocks' dividend payments less attractive compared to the risk-free yields on Treasurys. But now these stocks are priced to move, according to Barclays analyst Nicholas Campanella. ""The backdrop of the sector being one of the worst [Global Industry Classification Standard] performers in '23, along with a declining cost of capital narrative, should allow for utilities to outperform for 1H24,"" he wrote in a report Tuesday. XLU .SPX 1Y line Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund vs S & P 500 in past year Campanella's team raised its industry view on utilities to positive from neutral, citing a -19% price to earnings discount to the S & P 500 based on forward P/E multiples. ""Outside of disappointing price performance for 2023, we see utilities poised to benefit from similar tailwinds from grid investment opportunities and load growth in 2024, which are maintaining momentum while still adapting to the ever-changing financing and regulatory environment,"" Campanella said. Key factors Aside from utilities having fallen to an attractive entry point, other factors in the sector's favor include a waning cost of capital as the Fed anticipates three rate cuts in 2024. ""Widening interest rates have been a major source of negative EPS revisions for the last 2 years for the group and the potential for stabilization is a noteworthy positive,"" the analyst said. Barclays also expects electrical demand to rise, driven by data centers, the onshoring of industrial services and opportunities around electric vehicles. Transmission companies, such as American Electric Power and Dominion Energy , are also expected to benefit from higher load outlooks and offshore wind connection, said Campanella. There are still risks hanging over the sector. For instance, state elections could put consumers' bills in focus. Utilities must go through a regulatory process, known as a rate case, to raise prices. ""We continue to push investors to screen on breadth of regulatory exposure, preferring jurisdictions which are generally constructive from a return standpoint and with higher median incomes relative to rates and usage,"" the analyst said. This year's picks This week, Barclays upgraded its rating on Evergy to overweight from equal weight, noting that the company has moved past a key headwind: its recent rate case in Kansas. Evergy reached an agreement with Kansas regulators in November , which will result in a 3.54% rate increase for customers in the eastern third of the state. However, customers in the Kansas City metro area will see a rate decrease of about 4.53%. ""The stock currently trades at a ~12% discount to large-cap peers,"" the analyst said. Evergy pays a dividend yield of 4.8%, but six out of the nine analysts covering the stock rate it a hold, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. Barclays is also bullish on PG & E Corporation , naming it a top overweight for 2024 and noting its ""recent 70bps [return on equity] adjustment providing higher confidence in 9-10% EPS growth."" Roughly 62% of analysts covering PG & E rate it a buy or strong buy, per LSEG. PG & E recently declared a nominal one-cent per share dividend, payable Jan. 15. Duke Energy is another name Barclays favors, naming it a top overweight pick this year. ""We still like the stock,"" Barclays said, pointing to upside to consensus earnings per share as one of the factors behind its call. Duke offers a dividend yield of 4.2%, but 12 out of the 20 analysts following the stock rate it a hold, per LSEG. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",1/4/2024,0,0.251200885,0.683457375,0.004485609,0.046823874,0.011681292,0.002351041

How to pay a mortgage with a credit card

Lenders don't typically accept mortgage payments by credit card because they would have to pay a credit card transaction fee, which can be as high as 3.5%. You'd also be paying a secured debt with an unsecured debt, possibly with a higher interest rate. There are ways to indirectly use your card to pay your mortgage, however. Third-party payment platform Some vendors will make a payment to a lender on your behalf. Plastiq, for example, charges a 2.9% fee and the funds can be sent via cash, check or bank transfer. Plastiq will only process mortgage payments for cards on the Mastercard and Discover network, however, not Visa or American Express. Check with your issuer about any additional restrictions and to see if transactions are processed as purchases or cash advances. Cash advance If your card has a cash advance option, you could use it to pay your mortgage. There is typically a service fee for a cash withdrawal, however, and most card issuers start charging interest as soon as the advance posts on your account, rather than at the end of the billing cycle. The annual percentage rate (APR) on cash advances is considerably higher than on regular purchases: The APR on regular purchases on a Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card (see rates and fees), for example, is 19.99% to 29.99% variable (see rates and fees). The rate on cash advances, though, is 29.99% variable (see rates and fees).

A cash advance on the Venture card also comes with a service fee of 3% or $10 (whichever is greater; see rates and fees) and cash advances are not generally included in 0% APR introductory periods or rewards programs. Balance transfer check Some card issuers provide account holders with paper checks linked to their account that can be used to buy items, get cash or pay someone for services. Fees for these checks can range from 2% to 5% and transfer checks typically have a higher interest rate than purchases. If you're approved for a Chase Freedom Flex℠, you may receive balance transfer checks that can be made out to your mortgage provider. The fee for a balance transfer made within 60 days of opening a Freedom Flex card is $5 or 3%, whichever is more. (After the intro period, it goes up to $5 or 5%, whichever is higher.) In addition, Freedom Flex cardholders may qualify for a 0% intro APR on purchases and balance transfers for the first 15 months from account opening. After that, the base APR ranges from 20.49% to 29.24% variable.

Benefits of paying your mortgage with a credit card

There are upsides to using a card, though financial advisors suggest only doing it if you have the money to cover the payment on time and in full. Welcome bonus or rewards Since housing typically makes up the largest chunk of Americans' monthly expenses, charging your mortgage can help you get the most out of your card's rewards program. If you're hoping to take advantage of a welcome bonus, though, you'll have to get approved for a new card and use it within a limited window. The Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card (see rates and fees) has a welcome bonus of $200 when you spend $500 within the first three months from account opening. If your mortgage payment is $1,500, you'd make more than $150 after paying Plastiq's 2.9% service fee.



You'd also get 1.5% cash back, or $22.50, as part of the card's rewards program.

As a welcome bonus for new members, Discover will match all the miles you earn at the end of your first year.

The fee from Plastiq would be about $522, so you'd net a modest $18. But the card also comes with a 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases (17.24% to 28.24% variable APR afterward). That could give you some flexibility with making payments. Just be sure to pay off the total before the intro period expires or you'll be paying a much higher interest rate than your mortgage has.

Risks of using a credit card to pay your mortgage

There are fees associated with using a card to cover your mortgage payment, especially if you don't pay the balance in full by the end of the billing cycle. Interest and transaction fees If you carry a balance, the interest could wipe out any gain from your card's rewards program. Even if you pay in full before the end of the billing cycle, there's still the service fee from Plastiq. The Capital One Savor Cash Rewards Credit Card comes with a $300 welcome bonus if you spend $3,000 within three months of account opening. The fee for a $1,000 mortgage payment on Plastiq would be $29 (2.9% of $1,000), leaving you with a tidy sum of $271.

The APR on purchases for the Capital One Savor card starts at 19.99%, though, so if you don't make a full payment right away you'll wind up in the red pretty quickly. In addition, the payment to Plastiq isn't eligible for Savor's top cash-back categories — which include 5% cash back on hotels booked through Capital One Travel, 4% cash back on dining and 3% cash back on groceries. Impact on credit score and credit utilization ratio On-time payments are the largest factor in determining your FICO credit score. So you could seriously damage your credit if you don't pay the credit card bill by the due date. Even if you do pay it on time, your credit utilization ratio could take a temporary hit. Because issuers can be slow to report to the credit bureaus, there tends to be a lag between your current card balance and the balance on your credit report, according to Experian.

FAQ Can I use a credit card to pay my mortgage? While most mortgage lenders don't accept credit card payments, you may be able to charge the amount to a third-party company like Plastiq, which will send it in the form of cash, check or bank transfer for a fee. Can I earn points by paying my mortgage with a credit card? You can accrue points and other rewards by charging your monthly home payment to a third-party payment platform. Be sure, however, that the cash value of any benefits outweighs the fees and interest you could pay. Cash advances and balance transfers don't earn rewards. Can I get Bilt Rewards on my mortgage? Currently, the Bilt Mastercard (see rates and fees) can only be used to pay rent. The company indicated in January 2024 that it is looking into adding mortgage payments to its offerings.

Bottom line

Since lenders typically don't accept credit cards, you can usually only make a mortgage payment on your card via a third-party platform. Paying one debt by adding to another is a risky maneuver, however, and you should only consider it if you can afford to cover the payment in full. Even then, be sure the cash value of any credit card rewards outweighs the fees and interest you might accrue.

Annual fee The Amex Hilton Business Card's annual fee is increasing by $100, from $95 to $195 (see rates and fees). The increased fee goes into effect today for new applicants, however, it won't apply to existing cardholders until their first anniversary date that's on or after July 1, 2024. Increased welcome bonus Now through June 5, 2024, new card members can earn 175,000 Hilton points (an increase of 45,000 points over the previous welcome bonus) after spending $8,000 in eligible purchases on the card during the first six months after opening the account. Experts generally value Hilton points at 0.6 cents per point, which makes this bonus worth more than $1,000 in Hilton stays. With 175,000 Hilton points, you can book a variety of push hotels such as the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills, which typically costs 120,000 Hilton points or $1,000 a night.

New benefits

Hilton Business Card members will receive a handful of new features. Starting today, you'll have access to: 5X Hilton points on the first $100,000 in purchases per calendar year (then 3X points) outside of the card's other bonus categories

The ability to earn up to $240 back each year for eligible Hilton purchases (up to $60 back per quarter)

Free National Emerald Club Executive status, which gives you benefits such as free rental days and priority service (enrollment required)

Benefits that are ending or changing

With these changes, the Hilton Business Card will lose its Priority Pass airport lounge benefit 6X bonus earning categories. Cardholders will also no longer earn Free Night Rewards with the card. Lounge access end dates Here's how the 10 free Priority Pass lounge visits benefit will be phased out for existing cardholders: If you enrolled in Priority Pass on or before June 30, 2023, your membership will expire on July 1, 2024.

If you enrolled in Priority Pass between July 1, 2023, and June 30, 2024, your membership will expire on April 1, 2025. These dates allow current cardmembers to make the most of their airport lounge access before that feature disappears. Free night awards end date Before these changes, you could earn up to two Free Night Rewards each year with the Hilton Business card, but it took a lot of annual spending. You had to drop $15,000 in a calendar year to earn the first free night and $60,000 in total in the same year to earn the second free night. After June 30, 2024, this option is going away. But any eligible purchases you make with your Hilton Business Card before that date will qualify toward earning the Free Night Rewards. If you spend $15,000 on your card on or before June 30, 2024, you'll earn a free night and if you spend an additional $45,000 on the card ($60,000 in total) before the same date, you'll receive a second free night. 6X bonus categories end date Previously, the Hilton Business Card earned 6X points on purchases at: U.S restaurants

Airfare booked directly with an airline or through American Express Travel

Rental cars booked directly from select car rental companies

U.S. gas stations

U.S. shipping services

U.S. wireless telephone services New cardholders will not earn 6X points in these categories, but existing cardholders will continue to earn at that rate through June 30, 2024. After that date, these purchases will earn 5X points on the first $100,000 (then 3X points) in purchases per calendar year. Benefits that will stay the same Hilton Business Card holders will continue to receive these benefits and perks: Complimentary Hilton Gold status

What this means for you

The Hilton Business Card's overhaul is significant, some cardholders will see this as a small win and for others it's a big loss. Who benefits the most Travelers who stay at Hilton properties multiple times a year might find that the new $240 in Hilton statement credits more than offsets the increased $195 annual fee (see rates and fees). But that's only if they time their trips in a certain way — you can only earn $60 per financial quarter, so you'd need to stay with Hilton at least four times a year (with each booking spread out to once every three months) to get the full $240 statement credit. If you book two stays a year (with at least 3 months between each trip), you'd earn $120 in statement credits, effectively lowering the card's annual fee to $75 (which is less expensive than the pre-overhaul $95 fee). Cardholders who didn't spend much in the card's 6X bonus categories might also earn more rewards now that all spending (outside of those made directly with hotels and resorts in the Hilton portfolio) will earn 5X on the first $100,000 of purchases each calendar year (then 3X). Before the overhaul, cardholders would only earn 3X points on popular categories such as groceries. Who might lose some value If you have this card for airport lounge access, you'll likely want to consider an alternative since the Priority Pass benefit is vanishing. In addition, anyone who spent heavily on this card will miss the opportunity to earn Free Night Rewards. Before the overhaul, you had to spend $60,000 each year on the card to earn two free night awards but with those awards you could book nearly any Hilton hotel or resort, even if it cost $500 or $1,000 a night. By taking away the ability to earn Free Night Rewards, Amex is also removing one incentive to rack up a lot of spending on the Hilton Business Card.

Schulz-Sonoma County Airport in Santa Rosa on April 28, 2021. Patrick T. Fallon | AFP | Getty Images

In the nearly four years since the Covid-19 pandemic upended air travel, the largest U.S. airlines have returned to profitability. The CEOs of two upstart airlines that launched in the middle of the pandemic say they're about to join them. Avelo and Breeze Airways, two low-cost carriers that debuted in 2021 when U.S. air travel demand was more than 30% below pre-pandemic levels, have both grown their operations rapidly. They've launched dozens of new routes across the country, and their founders say their strategy of linking cities where there's less competition from large carriers is paying off. Think Los Angeles' Hollywood Burbank Airport, rather than Los Angeles International, or Islip, Long Island, over New York City. ""When you have Goliaths, and you're just David, it's really hard,"" said Avelo Airlines CEO Andrew Levy. Delta, American, United and Southwest together control about three-quarters of the U.S. market, according to Cirium data. Avelo says it flew 2.3 million customers in 2023, and that its planes were more than 80% full on average. Breeze flew more than 2.8 million travelers last year, and its flights were 77% full, according to the company. The carriers are still tiny. For comparison, Southwest Airlines, the largest domestic carrier, flew more than 137 million passengers last year. Yet, Avelo reported its first profitable quarter in the last three months of 2023, and a company spokesperson said the airline will likely turn an annual profit in 2024. It brought in revenue of $265 million for the full year 2023, up 74% from the prior year. Levy said he had expected the airline to turn a profit sooner, but high fuel costs during a period of broad inflation and Russia's invasion of Ukraine two years ago pushed back the timeline. Breeze is also on track for its first profitable year in 2024, said CEO David Neeleman.

It typically takes two to four years from launch for airlines to turn a profit, said Henry Harteveldt, president of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry consulting firm. Avelo and Breeze each faced additional challenges that have weighed on the entire industry, including a jump in oil prices, supply chain snarls and shortages of pilots and air traffic controllers. ""The fact that the airlines are both still operating is a credit to [Levy's and Neeleman's] visions, their leadership, but also the dedication of their employees,"" Harteveldt said.

Skipping hubs

Both airlines have staked a claim in the low-cost carrier segment, which also includes Frontier and Allegiant , which offer base fares, add-ons and secondary airport flights. Avelo flies to about 50 destinations and operates out of six bases including Connecticut's Tweed-New Haven Airport and Delaware's Wilmington Airport. Many of its destinations are from the Northeast to popular vacation destinations in Florida and South Carolina, but it also serves destinations in California and other western states in the U.S. The carrier moved beyond the continental U.S. in 2023 when it launched service to Puerto Rico and will likely expand to international destinations this year, Levy said. Breeze, which Neeleman founded after also starting JetBlue Airways and Brazilian carrier Azul , mostly eschews major hubs and flies out of about 50 airports such as New York's Westchester County Airport and Akron-Canton Airport in Ohio. It flies to standard vacation destinations, but also offers cross-country flights from cities such as Hartford, Connecticut or Charleston, South Carolina, to destinations including Las Vegas and Los Angeles. It hopes to launch international service by 2025. Avelo and Breeze have both continued to announce new routes and destinations this year. Avelo had 11 routes shortly after launching in the summer of 2021 and now has about 75, while Breeze flew about 16 routes that summer and is currently selling roughly 180.

Breeze and Avelo sell base fares — some as low as double digits — and charge fees for checked luggage and advanced seat assignments, upcharges that have become common not just among budget airlines, but most large carriers, too. Breeze's lowest-fare option allows travelers to bring on only a personal item, but the airline also sells first class seats and extra legroom options with more amenities. Neither airline's base fare includes a carry-on bag.

Operational costs

Offering low airfares has made industry-wide cost increases all the more daunting for Avelo and Breeze. The nationwide shortage of pilots following the pandemic and rising labor costs, for example, have posed a challenge. Large airlines, which can offer pilots big salaries, have hired away pilots from smaller carriers in recent years to staff up after the pandemic. ""What you really want to watch with pilots is attrition. … We had an attrition rate that was higher than we liked, and now it's where we want it,"" said Neeleman. The carrier has many first officers who are poised to be upgraded to captain, helping alleviate the shortage, he added. Airlines have also struggled with late deliveries of aircraft and difficulties getting thousands of replacement parts.",3/2/2024,0,0.004511067,0.987175167,0.001073568,0.0050013,0.001346866,0.000891966

Palestinian keffiyehs and signs that read ""Abandon Biden"": Arab American demonstrators in Warren, Michigan, made no secret of their anger at the president in early February as he visited the key swing state that helped carry him to victory in 2020. As voters head to the polls in Michigan's Democratic primary on Tuesday, there is a local campaign urging Democrats to choose ""uncommitted"" on the ballot as a form of protest vote again the administration's support for Israel in its war in Gaza. In January, Biden's reelection campaign manager, Julie Chavez Rodriguez, canceled a meeting with Arab American activists in Dearborn because of backlash over the administration's policies. The U.S. has sent billions of dollars in advanced weapons to supply Israel before and since the terror attack led by Palestinian militant group Hamas on Oct. 7. The assault killed some 1,200 people there and took a further 240 hostage, according to Israeli authorities. The Israeli military's response, which has been sharply criticized by numerous world leaders and aid organizations, has displaced some 1.9 million people in Gaza, according to the United Nations, and killed nearly 30,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas. The U.N. says that half a million people in the besieged enclave face starvation.

Dearborn, Michigan, is home to the largest Arab American population in the U.S. At the time Rodriguez's Dearborn meeting was canceled, the city's mayor, Abdullah H. Hammoud, tweeted: ""Little bit of advice – if you're planning on sending campaign officials to convince the Arab American community on why they should vote for your candidate, don't do it on the same day you announce selling fighter jets to the tyrants murdering our family members."" A spokesperson for the White House wasn't immediately available when contacted by CNBC. The primary vote on Tuesday will essentially be a referendum on what many of the state's Democratic voters feel about Biden, and will be a harbinger of just how worried the Biden campaign should be about its level of support in Michigan when it comes time for the general election. Michigan's Arab American community voted overwhelmingly for Biden in 2020, helping him carry the state and defeat then-incumbent President Donald Trump. But its population could be the determining factor in whether Biden takes the state this year, and its crucial 15 Electoral College votes with it.

""The U.S. election for President Biden could swing on two or three states,"" Fred Kempe, CEO of the Atlantic Council, told CNBC. ""Take one of those states, Michigan, [which] Biden won by fewer votes in the last election than there are Arab American votes that could go against him, because of what's going on in the Middle East. So it's an international situation for Biden, it's also a deeply domestic political situation."" Biden has voiced support for the creation of an independent Palestinian state, and has asked Israel to do more to protect civilian life in Gaza — but critics say the words are meaningless if the administration refuses to use its leverage to force the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to change course. The U.S. has consistently voted against every cease-fire measure put forward at the U.N. since the war began. Senior White House officials met with community leaders in Michigan on Feb. 8, during which U.S. deputy national security advisor Jon Finer vocally acknowledged the administration's actions and ""missteps"" with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the war in Gaza.

""We are very well aware that we have missteps in the course of responding to this crisis since October 7,"" Finer said in recordings of the closed-door meeting published by The New York Times. ""We have left a very damaging impression based on what has been a wholly inadequate public accounting for how much the president, the administration and the country values the lives of Palestinians,"" he continued. ""And that began, frankly, pretty early in the conflict."" Finer added that he did not ""have any confidence in this current government of Israel."" Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has warned voters against the ""uncommitted"" campaign, stressing that ""any vote that's not cast for Joe Biden supports a second Trump term,"" which she said would be ""devastating"" for the Muslim community.

Previously the central bank's deputy governor, Karahan's resume features years spent in prominent American institutions and companies. He received both a master's degree and doctorate in economics at the University of Pennsylvania, spent nearly a decade as an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, worked as a part-time lecturer at Columbia University and New York University, and served as a senior economist at Amazon.

It is hoped that the 42-year-old economist's experience will serve him well as he heads the institution working to tackle the eye-watering inflation and cost-of-living crisis that has hit Turkey's population of 85 million. The country's currency, the lira, is down 38% against the dollar year to date and has lost more than 80% of its value against the greenback over the last five years.

Turkey's consumer price index print came out Monday showing a roughly 65% increase year on year for the month of January. Its central bank has made eight consecutive interest rate hikes since May 2023 — for a cumulative 3,650 basis points — in an effort to rein in soaring inflation. The latest rate increase, on Jan. 25, raised Turkey's key interest rate by 250 basis points to 45%, though its leaders signaled at the time that the hiking cycle was at its end.

While painful for the country, investors and economists say that the rate hikes have been necessary and that continuity in monetary policy priorities will engender confidence in the new central bank chief.

In his statement posted to the Turkish central bank's website Sunday, Karahan stressed ""price stability"" as his team's main priority, vowing to ""ensure disinflation"" and ""maintain the necessary monetary tightness until inflation falls to levels consistent with our target.""",2/5/2024,0,0.001906213,0.987546146,0.000896884,0.005961555,0.002873656,0.000815546

The Department of Justice's landmark antitrust case against Apple could affect how consumers pay for everything from coffee to clothes. In their nearly 90-page suit filed last week, state and federal prosecutors say that Apple's alleged monopoly over the smartphone market extends to its handling of digital payments. As more people tap their phone screens at retail registers and pay for e-commerce purchases through wallet apps, the iPhone's features for consumers and policies toward developers create an unfair advantage for Apple, the DOJ claims. The tech giant rejects that view and has vowed to contest the government's allegations in court — a process that will likely entail years of legal wrangling. But with the nature of smartphone transactions in play, here's what could eventually change if prosecutors get everything they want.

More wallet apps

Antitrust enforcers want to give smartphone users more options and control over how they pay with their devices. Apple currently restricts outside developers from creating their own digital wallets. The Justice Department argues that the policy limits users' payment options and traps them within the Apple Wallet, the iPhone app that lets users load their debit and credit cards onto their devices. Authorities want to allow developers and banks to create wallet apps of their own that could operate on both Apple's iOS platform and rival ones like Android. That would let users transition more seamlessly to non-Apple devices, the suit says, because users could take their digital wallets and financial data with them — potentially spurring greater competition to develop better consumer financial apps and features. The lawsuit also challenges Apple's practice of charging banks up to 15% for credit card transactions on Apple Pay, its digital payments platform, arguing that the fees cut into lenders' ability to invest in improving the mobile banking experience.

Jamaica pulls U.S. boys from troubled teen school after allegations they were abused

Guns found at Sean 'Diddy' Combs' L.A. and Miami properties during federal searches, sources say In digital payments and elsewhere, Apple has argued its successes were won fair and square, attested by its huge, loyal customer base. A spokesperson pointed to the statement the company released following the DOJ lawsuit, highlighting Apple's product design that it said emphasizes privacy, security and seamlessness. The antitrust suit ""threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,"" the company said. ""If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple — where hardware, software, and services intersect.""

Tap-to-pay in more places

The battle over Apple's digital payments has also put a spotlight on contactless transactions, the method of paying at restaurants and retailers that has become a fixture of consumers' brick-and-mortar spending. As part of its restrictions on third parties, Apple limits developers' access to the iPhone's near-field communication (NFC) capabilities, the technology that enables the frictionless experience users enjoy with Apple Pay. The DOJ wants Apple to release its hold on NFC, which the agency says would result in a ""proliferation of other payment apps"" to compete with Apple Pay. ""It's increasingly an important way that we transact,"" said Matt Platkins, the attorney general of New Jersey, one of 15 states and Washington, D.C., that joined the DOJ's case and the state where authorities filed the suit. ""And yet Apple has decided to prohibit you from using it, except on their specific wallet, which is only available on an iPhone."" ""All of that is hurting consumers,"" Platkin said, ""and limiting their choices in ways that we think violates the law."" Some of the changes U.S. prosecutors are seeking have already been won in the European Union, where regulators successfully pushed Apple to allow third-party developers direct access to the iPhone's NFC functionality. That was the only E.U. case mentioned in the DOJ's sprawling suit. ""It is not an accident that iPhone users can only use one type of digital wallet to tap to pay,"" said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group. ""Apple did not invent the near-field-communication technology that powers tap-to-pay, but they are trying to use its iPhone platform to be the exclusive provider for it in digital wallets inside its ecosystem."" Despite its concessions on NFC access in other parts of the world, Apple has said it remains concerned about users' security under that approach.

43,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/28/apples-bad-quarter-and-what-history-says-will-happen-next.html,AAPL,Apple Inc.,Apple's bad quarter and what history says will happen next,"Apple is wrapping up a rough quarter, but history and Wall Street analysis show there is reason to expect a bounce ahead. The technology giant has dropped more than 4% in March alone, bringing its first-quarter loss to nearly 10%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has climbed almost 2% in March and above 9% during the three-month period. But that underperformance could come to an end. Apple shares have typically risen following a quarter that ends down at least 10%, according to CNBC Pro data. Wall Street consensus forecasts imply the stock could be in for a bounce. The stock has struggled after the U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the company last week. In what is expected to be a landmark antitrust case, regulators said Apple has created a monopoly within the smartphone market. AAPL 3M mountain Apple over the last three months That added to investor jitters seen earlier in the quarter after iPhone demand was called into question as the Chinese economy struggles. In fact, Counterpoint Research found iPhone sales there dropped 24% in the first six weeks of 2024. Concerns about long-term demand for the Vision Pro have heightened worries around interest for products. Elsewhere, the stock appears to have missed much of the hype given to competitors for their artificial intelligence plans. Now, market participants appear to be waiting for clues or announcements on the topic, with many expecting news during Apple's developers conference in June. 'Best bought on weakness' Despite the tough period, Wall Street sees reason for optimism ahead. Nearly 2 out of every 5 analysts rate the stock a buy, with the average price target implying a bounce of more than 15%, according to FactSet. Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney acknowledged that Apple was a ""controversial"" pick given its recent challenges. But Mahoney said the stock could once again test all-time highs — which would require a gain of about 18% — if it can enter the AI space and find ways to monetize. A sell-off should actually be viewed as a good entry point, he added. Apple ""is a stock best bought on weakness in general as they probably have the best, or one of the best management teams in the world,"" Mahoney said. ""It is not a trade for the faint of heart and needs a longer time horizon, but certainly, this is not a company that is going away any time soon."" Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes is even more bullish, expecting the stock to rally almost 27% and notch a new record at $220. That target is based on a multiple of 30 times the firm's per-share earnings estimate of $7.35 for the full 2026 year. Similar to Mahoney, Reitzes said his outlook depends in part on the company's ability to meaningfully break into the AI space, something he is hoping to see information on at the developers conference . ""This target multiple places Apple at a modest premium to elite consumer products companies, who lack Apple's installed base, recurring revenue and AI upside long-term,"" Reitzes wrote to clients Monday. ""Apple needs to do a lot to get there — like stabilize China and get through the challenges to growth overall in C1H24. However, if it can deliver a new narrative in AI, we still think it can more than make up for many obstacles."" Until the June conference, he said Apple leaders ""deserve the benefit of the doubt."" Others anticipate a more muted gain. Following the Justice Department news, HSBC analyst Nicolas Cote-Colisson kept his hold rating and target price of $180, which implies an upside of just under 4%. Good historical indicators History can also provide justification for bullishness on the stock. After quarters over the past 20 years when Apple dropped at least 10%, the stock gained around 10% on average in the following three-month period. Apple was positive in nine of the 14 quarters analyzed by CNBC Pro. In the median quarter following the losing one, shares jumped more than 14%. These quarters show a wide range of potential outcomes. After the stock lost more than 11% in the second quarter of 2025, shares came roaring back to life with a rally of more than 45%. On the other hand, the final quarter of 2008 brought a sell-off of nearly 25%, only adding to the dive of more than 32% seen during the preceding three-month period. — CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this report.",3/28/2024,0,0.300812781,0.432439864,0.005380254,0.169680044,0.084741928,0.006945042

The European Union on Monday began an investigation into Apple , Alphabet and Meta , in its first probe under the sweeping new Digital Markets Act tech legislation. ""Today, the Commission has opened non-compliance investigations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) into Alphabet's rules on steering in Google Play and self-preferencing on Google Search, Apple's rules on steering in the App Store and the choice screen for Safari and Meta's 'pay or consent model,'"" the European Commission said in a statement. The first two probes focus on Alphabet and Apple and relate to so-called anti-steering rules. Under the DMA, tech firms are not allowed to block businesses from telling their users about cheaper options for their products or about subscriptions outside of an app store.

""The way that Apple and Alphabet's implemented the DMA rules on anti-steering seems to be at odds with the letter of the law. Apple and Alphabet will still charge various recurring fees, and still limit steering,"" the EU's competition chief, Margrethe Vestager, said during a news conference Monday. Apple has already fallen foul of the EU's rules. This month, the company was fined 1.8 billion euros ($1.95 billion) after the European Commission said it found that Apple had applied restrictions on app developers that prevented them from informing iOS users about alternative and cheaper music subscription services available outside of the app. In a third inquiry, the commission said it is investigating whether Apple has complied with its DMA obligations to ensure that users can easily uninstall apps on iOS and change default settings. The probe also focuses on whether Apple is actively prompting users with choices to allow them to change default services on iOS, such as for the web browser or search engine. The commission said that it is ""concerned that Apple's measures, including the design of the web browser choice screen, may be preventing users from truly exercising their choice of services within the Apple ecosystem."" Apple said it believes it is in compliance with the DMA. ""We're confident our plan complies with the DMA, and we'll continue to constructively engage with the European Commission as they conduct their investigations. Teams across Apple have created a wide range of new developer capabilities, features, and tools to comply with the regulation,"" an Apple spokesperson told CNBC on Monday. The fourth probe targets Alphabet, as the European Commission looks into whether the firm's display of Google search results ""may lead to self-preferencing in relation to Google's,"" other services such as Google Shopping, over similar rival offerings. ""To comply with the Digital Markets Act, we have made significant changes to the way our services operate in Europe,"" Oliver Bethell, director of competition at Alphabet, said in a statement. ""We have engaged with the European Commission, stakeholders and third parties in dozens of events over the past year to receive and respond to feedback, and to balance conflicting needs within the ecosystem. We will continue to defend our approach in the coming months."" Alphabet pointed to a blog post from earlier this month, wherein the company outlined some of those changes — including giving Android phone users the option to easily change their default search engine and browser, as well as making it easier for people to see comparison sites in areas like shopping or flights in Google searches.

Meta investigation

The fifth and final investigation focuses on Meta and its so-called pay and consent model. Last year, Meta introduced an ad-free subscription model for Facebook and Instagram in Europe. The commission is looking into whether offering the subscription model without ads or making users consent to terms and conditions for the free service is in violation of the DMA. ""The Commission is concerned that the binary choice imposed by Meta's 'pay or consent' model may not provide a real alternative in case users do not consent, thereby not achieving the objective of preventing the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers."" Thierry Breton, the EU's internal market commissioner, said during the news conference that there should be ""free alternative options"" offered by Meta for its services that are ""less personalized."" ""Gatekeepers"" is a label for large tech firms that are required to comply with the DMA in the EU. ""We will continue to use all available tools, should any gatekeeper try to circumvent or undermine the obligations of the DMA,"" Vestager said. Meta said subscriptions are a common business model across various industries. ""Subscriptions as an alternative to advertising are a well-established business model across many industries, and we designed Subscription for No Ads to address several overlapping regulatory obligations, including the DMA. We will continue to engage constructively with the Commission,"" a Meta spokesperson told CNBC on Monday.

Apple could double down on the China smartphone market amid declining iPhone sales and stiff competition in the country, Wedbush Securities said on Monday.

Apple needs to overcome its China challenges including a tough macro environment and competition from Huawei before the iPhone 16 release and ""it all starts with reaffirming Apple's presence in China,"" Wedbush said.

China's Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao met Apple CEO Tim Cook on Friday and said his country holds opportunities for Apple as well as other companies, and asked the iPhone maker to keep building its business in China for ""shared development,"" according to a press statement.

Cook said China was a crucial supply chain partner for Apple and the company plans to increase investment in the country in the long term, the statement said.

Last week, Cook opened Apple's newest flagship store in Shanghai on Thursday and met with key suppliers in China, according to media reports. He also attended the China Development Forum in Beijing, as China seeks to woo foreign investors amid regulatory and global uncertainties.

Cook's latest trip to China, which Wedbush said is ""a sign Apple could double down"" on China, comes amid reports of iPhone sales in China plunging 24% in the first six weeks of 2024.",3/26/2024,0,0.710591137,0.188683495,0.003985621,0.043969914,0.04917096,0.003598769

Apple popped 4.3% after Bloomberg News reported that the company would transition its Mac product line to artificial intelligence-focused chips.

Technology stocks lifted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite into positive territory midday Thursday as investors bought into the dip from earlier in the week.

The S&P 500 jumped and the Nasdaq Composite closed at a record Thursday as tech shares climbed higher, rebounding from an earlier pullback over concerns of persistent inflation.

The Dow is on pace to end the week lower by 1.1%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 trimmed its earlier losses following a hot CPI report, and it is down just 0.1% week to date. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 1.2% for the week.

The producer price index reading for March came in below estimates, providing some relief after Wednesday's sell-off on a hot consumer prices report.

""The inflation data are noisy, and the market reflects that reality.

There's been a recent uptick in U.S. CEOs making treks to China in search of favor and foothold. This ritual, epitomized by high-profile engagements — such as Apple CEO Tim Cook's effusive overtures and statements of commitments to China — signals that American corporate titans think the strategy can still work. It won't. It's a strategic play drawn from an antiquated playbook. In an increasingly difficult geopolitical environment — especially for tech companies caught in a high stakes rivalry between the U.S. and China — showering praise on China makes some sense. The approach is rooted in a history of success. For decades, the formula seemed straightforward: show up, show respect, and pledge high investment in China, and in return, hope to gain access to the perceived vast markets and manufacturing prowess. Tim Cook's recent sojourn in China, including pledges of increased investment and the expansion of research and development facilities, exemplify this tried and tested strategy. Tim Cook's narrative of China as ""critical"" to Apple , coupled with his admiration for the country's advanced manufacturing capabilities, embodies the ethos of this engagement playbook.

Boeing was a previous example. During a different era when China needed Boeing, and Boeing was not bedeviled by the current set of problems, its CEOs engaged with China frequently helping to secure significant aircraft orders. A pivotal moment came in 2011, when then-CEO Jim McNerney visited China, leading to substantial deals for Boeing that touched off a massive race for orders between Boeing and Airbus. That trip underscored how impactful and important high-level CEO engagements used to be in fostering long-term business relationships and deals in China. Volkswagen's venture into China in the early 1980s, establishing its first joint venture, is another hallmark of successful engagement. The strategic move not only granted Volkswagen a first-mover advantage but also set a precedent for foreign direct investment in China, demonstrating the potential benefits of early and often CEO engagement in those days. But the approach has run its course. It is no longer fit for purpose in an era of intense bilateral economic competition, geopolitical tensions, technological rivalries, and a profound reshaping of the global economic landscape. CEOs who continue to bet on this strategy should expect diminishing marginal returns, particularly under Xi Jinping's leadership.

Despite frequent high-level visits and engagements, tech companies like Qualcomm have faced increasing regulatory challenges and fines in China, underscoring the limits of corporate diplomacy, particularly for the technology sector. It can be argued that the turning point came long ago, with Google's high-profile exit from China in 2010, despite previous attempts by its CEOs to engage with Chinese authorities. The challenges faced by Google underscore the complexities of operating in China under its stringent regulatory environment, regardless of adroit high-level CEO diplomacy. The Facebook case is particularly instructive. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg went to notable lengths to court China, demonstrating a willingness to engage deeply with Chinese culture and business practices. He learned Mandarin and used it to communicate during public appearances and meetings in China. He was photographed jogging through Tiananmen Square in Beijing. These actions were part of a broader strategy to make Facebook palatable to Chinese authorities and gain entry into the lucrative Chinese market. But despite Zuckerberg's concerted efforts, Facebook remains blocked in China, with the Great Firewall preventing access to the platform. The Chinese government's stringent control over the internet and social media, coupled with its push to support domestic social media platforms like Weibo and WeChat, created a nearly insurmountable barrier. In this environment, Tim Cook's attempts to pull out all the stops will not be rewarded over the long-term. It's not that the Apple CEO is doing anything wrong. He is executing textbook corporate diplomacy. The problem is that in this environment, not only does China have concerns about Western tech and Western companies, but the China of today also has formidable options to replace foreign companies with its own champions. That makes the playbook a limited impact one for advancing the interests of foreign businesses over the long-term, given how much has changed since Volkswagen and Boeing and others pioneered the high-flying CEO visit to China strategy. Despite Cook's efforts, Apple faces declining sales in China, a testament to the growing domestic competition, security concerns about foreign hardware and software, and an increasingly nationalistic and patriotic Chinese consumers. The resurgence of domestic champions like Huawei, buoyed by the new nationalistic fervor and government support, illustrates a market increasingly resistant to foreign dominance.

Strategic alignment with China's market and technological ambitions risks ensnaring companies in the crossfires of the escalating trade and technology wars between the U.S. and China. This battleground, marked by efforts to control emerging technologies with potential military applications, presents a perilous terrain for companies caught between nationalistic policies and their own global market aspirations. Xi is determined to remake China's market dynamics but also to win the struggle for technological supremacy. The pride associated with domestic achievements in technology, exemplified by Huawei's breakthroughs and the global reach of platforms like TikTok, AliExpress, and Shein, underscores a burgeoning sentiment of economic and technological nationalism. This landscape poses a stark challenge for foreign firms attempting to maintain, grow or align themselves with China's economic and technological future growth while also maintaining favor with their own governments, markets, and domestic consumers. While it's tempting to interpret China's latest round of outreach to foreign CEOs and foreign investors as a fundamental shift in viewpoint by the Chinese leadership, it is more accurately a tactical adaptation in response to current economic challenges, not a reversal of Xi Jinping's long-term strategic goals. The emphasis on national security and self-sufficiency, especially in critical strategic sectors, remains paramount. What we're observing is a pragmatic short-term adjustment rather than a significant ""Great Pivot"" in China's overarching approach. In this context, the continued reliance on old strategies reveals not just a failure to adapt but a potential underestimation of the shifting dynamics at play. CEOs visiting China, while aiming to secure their companies' futures, must recognize the dual reality of opportunity and obsolescence. The approach needs a recalibration: a blend of strategic engagement with China combined with rigorous de-risking and diversification efforts. This strategy acknowledges the potential benefits of the Chinese market while preparing for the volatilities, uncertainties, and increased competition by China's own companies and global brands. If these CEOs must travel, then engagements with Chinese leadership, including Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang, should transcend the exclusive pursuit of favorable press and glittery narratives, and should instead include time for a hard-nosed discussion about concrete policies, policy clarifications in a highly muddled policy environment, and above all press for actions that safeguard foreign business interests. This dialogue is crucial, not just for immediate operational clarity but as a foundational step towards a more resilient and adaptive strategy.",3/27/2024,2,0.001421746,0.987490952,0.00157859,0.008059109,0.001086,0.00036359

52,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/19/cramer-the-feds-rate-hikes-did-little-to-slow-our-robust-economy.html,AMAT,Applied Materials,Let's accept it: The Fed's rate hikes did little to slow this roaring economy,"Can't stop won't stop? OK, you will never confuse me for a rapper, but those are the four words that describe this economy right now. And as we walk into retail earnings hell — a period where too many retailers report all at once and the comparisons become odiously confusing, starting with Walmart and Home Depot before the bell on Tuesday — I have to marvel that there is no discernible let-up in spending across most areas. There are a couple of ways to measure things. First, we can just look at some of the companies that reported late this past week: Applied Materials, DraftKings, DoorDash, Toast, and The Trade Desk. Second, we can examine the cacophony of 52-week highs that stick out like a dazzling neon shouting ""Gangbusters."" So let's do both. Let's start with Toast , a remarkable company with a client roster of 106,000 restaurants, up 34% from a year ago, almost all providing annual recurring revenue. The cloud-based restaurant management software company is going after the big chains, like Caribou Coffee, and winning. It is also winning small- and medium-sized businesses — perhaps more than 30% of that market, although having been in this business I have no idea how that share is calculated. I have not been a fan of this company because of its losses and its inability to pivot to profit. Restaurants can also switch to a competitor pretty easily. But the company announced on Thursday that it will lay off 10% of its workforce, so the pivot is now here. Most surprising, however, is the strength of restaurant formation right now, which makes the ascent of Toast so obvious. When an economy is in full-blown retreat, this is a segment that gets decked. Now it's easy to get a read-through when you consider the earnings progression of companies that support restaurants like Ecolab , Cintas , and Sysco (Cintas CEO Todd Schneider joined me on ""Mad Money"" in late December, while Sysco CEO Kevin Hourican was on in late January). Their results can tell you how much growth there has been across a vast panoply of operations. But Toast is discretionary, and therefore a sight to be seen. I know people panned the DoorDash quarter, but from the point of view of revenues (27% growth) and not profits it shows me that people are willing to spend even more money to not go out. You have to add the DoorDash numbers to the Toast numbers to see the strength of the go-out and go-in parts of the economy. The numbers are so daunting that it's hard to see them slowing down. The Trade Desk plies its technology in the trillion-dollar ad market and its 23% sales growth in the fourth quarter demonstrates that companies are accelerating their marketing spend, something that they almost always cut back on if they are hurting. As a result, The Trade Desk can be viewed as both a barometer of e-commerce and the temperature of connected TV, which can only be described as boiling. It's not easy to read into the 64% growth in revenue from DraftKings as there are always fresh states and fresh markets for online gambling. Suffice it to say that gambling may be the most excessive spending imaginable unless, of course, you bet against the Philadelphia Eagles for the last six games of this NFL season — a painful annuity stream. Perhaps the most absurdly positive numbers came from Applied Materials , which makes the machines that make DRAM and NAND flash chips used for tons of devices not necessary if you are cutting back. The company's better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results and strong second-quarter numbers signal that the inventory glut that came from excess personal computers and other Best Buy kinds of consumer tech items is now history. Talk about things you do not need. When I say not need, I am not saying that we have become profligate, although with ""buy now, pay later"" we have discovered a hidden sense of profligacy. I am just saying that the Federal Reserve does not have a handle on how overheated this economy has become. A random walk down the new 52-week-high list confirms this, with 53 stocks in the S & P 500 hitting that milestone on Friday alone. That included Simon Property Group , the national mall company with barely any vacancies and at full-price leases, and Ralph Lauren , which jumped 30 points on an earnings surprise. That was some quarter from Ralph, but in truth so were the last two quarters — this one was just better received on the Street. Costco hit a new high last week, too: That's been the juggernaut in retail the whole way. As did Walmart. There aren't a lot of individual retailers on the new high list. We may see Rite Aid in bankruptcy. We may wonder about the liquidity of Big Lots . But neither of these chains is in a Simon Property indoor mall, where the occupancy rate is 96%-98%. But Children's Place ? It was in trouble for about a day and then Reuters reported that a Saudi family scooped in and bought 54% and that was that. The financing is now there. It wouldn't be if we were at the murderous portion of a tightening cycle. New fintech is flagging, but old fintech is zooming. We can tell this from the incredible performances of Mastercard and American Express , the latter finally silencing all doubters with its multiple-year double-digit projections. The credit card company was always capable of making those rosy forecasts but had been reluctant to do so. The fact that it did now says it all. Remember the drivers of American Express were two-fold: solvency and spending, with the latter heavily geared to dining out. Travel was almost as strong. In case you thought that Applied Materials was alone, KLA and Lam Research once again hit new highs. You need these companies for all sorts of semiconductor chips and Lam has some very good technology that goes with Nvidia's supercomputer. That group seems unstoppable. Waste Management makes the list and people may not realize this, but the biggest source of waste comes from construction, particularly home construction. The company had an excellent quarter, which means people believe we are still going to be in growth mode for new planned unit developments. We have so many scaremongers out there when it comes to commercial real estate — I keep thinking of the imprudent comments by Starwood Capital Group CEO Barry Sternlicht about $1 trillion of losses on office properties — but then how in the heck is the stock of elevator company Otis on the list. Sure, a big part of the company's business is service. There's also a China component. However, we already know that China's construction has crashed. Instead, it's a sign that smaller buildings may be using Otis. The fact is that buildings are being built, and while commercial real estate may be a danger zone, it's not for lack of demand, it may be for lack of useable supply. Meanwhile, just in case you were concerned that the trillions of dollars earmarked by the U.S. government for infrastructure are running out, you see Eaton , Emerson , Dover , Cummins, and the ubiquitous Parker-Hannifin all made new highs last week too. Over the many years working in this business, I was schooled and taught to trust the aggregate data. Here's what I learned: following the aggregate data is like being a fan. Studying the actual numbers is what a professional can do. All of the new companies make being a pro harder, so you have to work even more — even when it's a drag to monitor Toast sign-ups, Uber rides, or DoorDash deliveries. When you look at the mosaic from the bottom up, it shows that we have an economy that has not been dented by higher interest rates. That's not because auto sales haven't slowed down. They have. It's not because housing hasn't slowed down. It has. It's not because spending on goods hasn't slowed down. It has. But nothing has slowed down enough to make a difference when it comes to inflation. A home price plus a mortgage is about where it's been the whole time. Dining out, traveling, hotels — none of it has come down and some prices are still going up. Very few salaries have kept up with inflation and now we have anywhere from eight to ten million immigrants that are either part of the labor force or receiving government assistance. The former keeps wages down and the latter keeps inflation up, as housed immigrants drive up rent rates, which are in the consumer price index. So let's just cut to the chase. There is only one way to keep inflation lower and that's through layoffs. There are all sorts of stories about tech layoffs. Those are almost all one-off though and you aren't going to see those people on breadlines. We know that there have been some fintech layoffs but amazingly we have not seen large-scale shutdowns. Private companies that want to go public will be able to or will be kept on life support until they can. It's why I like Morgan Stanley now as much as I like Wells Fargo , if not more. Morgan Stanley stands to gain once the IPO market picks up. Still, so many people delude themselves into thinking about a June rate cut, as they once believed there would be a cut in March or May. I have been adamant that this economy isn't too strong, but it also isn't slowing. And if slowing is what it takes to bring rate cuts, then you know the only thing that will slow it is higher, if not much higher, unemployment. The obvious issue is the lack of any sort of rigor or even homework to justify why rate cuts should occur. What would they do other than cause inflation to flood right back in? I sure wish that the Fed had never made its statement it was done raising rates for now — even though it precipitated one heck of a rally. For now a simple ""let's wait and see"" from the central bank without mentioning cuts this year would be a better state of play than the current one. Hanging on every cutting word from the Fed is a noose for this market. I will change my mind when a company like Children's Place has no suitors and the lots of homes are empty. Until then we have to accept that the reason why earnings season has been so bountiful is that we have an amazingly robust — not just resilient — economy and rate hikes have done next to nothing to change things.

Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office sold $112 million worth of Alphabet shares last quarter, according to a regulatory filing. His firm briefly held Alphabet in the first quarter of 2023, sold it the next quarter and entered the stock again in the third quarter. Shares of Alphabet soared 58% in 2023, but the stock has underperformed in 2024. Its latest earnings report showed ad revenue that trailed analysts' projections. The legendary investor, who has never had a down year in the markets, previously said AI could be a fruitful opportunity for investors , especially when the economy comes out of the next recession. He said he has been betting on the space through two stocks — Microsoft and Nvidia. Druckenmiller added to his big Microsoft bet slightly in the most recent quarter, leaving the stake valued at more than $400 million and family office's biggest holding. Meanwhile, the 70-year-old protege of George Soros trimmed his holding in Nvidia last quarter, making it his third biggest stake at the end of 2023 (worth more than $300 million.) But Druckenmiller, a Bowdoin College grad, bought call options on Nvidia with a notional value of $242 million last quarter. Call options give an investor an option to buy a stock later at a given strike price, and increase in value as the underlying asset rises in price. ""I actually think AI is very, very real and could be every bit as impactful as the internet literally going forward,"" Druckenmiller said last year at the Sohn Investment Conference . ""It could be a beautiful opportunity in a hard landing just like '01, '02 ... a beautiful opportunity when the tech bubble bursts. ... AI could be there."" Druckenmiller once managed Soros' Quantum Fund and shot to fame after helping make a $10 billion bet against the British pound in 1992. He later oversaw $12 billion as president of Duquesne Capital Management before closing his firm in 2010. During the fourth quarter, the investor also added relatively small stakes in a host of other stocks, including Arista Networks , Woodward , Tempur Sealy, Flex Ltd , Barrick Gold and Marvell Technology .",2/15/2024,0,0.103895113,0.112125441,0.003933383,0.756291807,0.020967694,0.002786481

Tepper cut back exposure to Advanced Micro Devices , Intel , Lam Research , Micron , Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor in the latest quarter, regulatory fillings show. That might signal some profit taking, as the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) climbed more than 20% in the three-month period alone, and more than 72% in all of last year. Taiwan Semiconductor saw the largest sale on a percentage basis, with the Carolina Panthers football team owner approximately halving his stake. He took more than 20% out of his positions in Qualcomm, Nvidia and Intel , while pulling about 13% out of Micron and nearly the same in AMD.

This year, that ETF is continuing to perform with nearly 5% increase year-to-date. Citi, which has an overweight rating on information technology within the growth cyclicals segment, is optimistic on the sector in certain markets. China is one. While investors have been fleeing China markets — although stocks had a respite this week — Citi said in a recent report that additional' policy support from the government could improve sentiment. China recently eased its monetary policy. In a separate 2024 wealth outlook report by Citi, the bank said that thanks to the easing of policies so far, the Chinese economy is ""likely to produce a mild cyclical recovery"" in 2024."" ""Potential tactical investment opportunities could arise among industrials, consumer discretionary and information technology – especially in the most advanced technology areas now favored by policies,"" Citi wrote.

The list was updated in a Feb. 1 report. These are ""high conviction, differentiated stock recommendations to generate alpha"" that were selected by the bank's analysts. ""We identify catalysts that will trigger outperformance and chose liquid names in which investors can build positions,"" Citi said. Arista Networks is a new addition to the list. Citi said it likes Arista's positioning on the long-term exposure to the general artificial intelligence megatrend, among other factors.

He also recommended researching retail stocks next week before the industry reports a slew of earnings results the week after.

""Next week seems busy, but, you know what, it's a classic interregnum — Google that — before we get to retail earnings,"" Cramer said. ""Remember, those heavy earnings weeks are all in front of us, and they're about doing your homework.""

On Monday, Cramer said he'll be waiting for earnings reports from two ""scorchers,"" cloud networking outfit Arista Networks and Cadence Design Systems , which provides software for artificial intelligence hardware. Both companies hit all-time highs on Friday, and Cramer said that may mean they're coming in too hot, but added that their stocks could go higher if the quarters are positive.

Shopify reports on Tuesday, and Cramer said he's optimistic because online shopping seems to be booming. Also reporting on Tuesday is Marriott, which Cramer said has been a consistent winner because it's grouped in with several travel stocks that have been performing well. He said he's also optimistic about Tuesday reports from used car dealer AutoNation , animal health company Zoetis and airplane parts manufacturer Howmet .

Wednesday brings a report from Kraft Heinz , which Cramer said he wouldn't touch because the stock has been obliterated, and packaged food companies are ""out of style"" on Wall Street. He also worried about the report from Cisco , with the company reportedly laying off thousands of employees, as he thought it would wait to do layoffs until it closed on its acquisition of Splunk .

Thursday, Cramer said he'll be paying attention to Wendy's report and said he's not sure the results will be positive after the company's change in management. He'll also be watching a report from the Trade Desk , which he said consistently beats its numbers and rivals Google in placing online advertisements.

The frequent use of them and other tech devices can be draining and distracting and still, it is difficult for us to cut down. Americans check their phones 144 times a day on average, according to a 2023 survey by Reviews.org.

Constantly looking at your smartphone can negatively impact the depth of your conversations, Anastasia Dedyukhina, a digital wellbeing expert, tells CNBC Make It. This is true even if it's just on a table nearby during a chat with a friend or colleague, according to a 2014 study.

""If I had my smartphone next to me, it would attract my attention, consciously or unconsciously,"" Dedyukhina says.

""I would also keep thinking about it because for our minds, a smartphone and the sound of a smartphone is a highly attractive stimuli. So when I hear my phone ringing and make a notification, for my mind, it's the same as if you were calling me by my name.""

Frequently switching between tasks can have consequences on your health, according to Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, who wrote a book about attention span and how to refocus when distracted. Shifting what you're focusing on often can increase levels of stress, require more mental effort to complete tasks and cause feelings of frustration and time pressure, Mark told Fast Company in 2008.

""I'm on a mountain bike ride right here in Boulder, [Colorado], and I'm eating an energy gel [packet],"" Gold told CNBC in a recent interview. ""And I was curious why you couldn't put peanut butter or almond butter in that same type of squeeze pack and have an on-the-go, plant-based protein experience like an energy bar.""

Gold had been selling nut butters at a popular farmer's market in Boulder for two years by that point. He'd landed a coveted placement in the local Whole Foods Market, too.

But at the time, consumers still gravitated toward a handful of traditional peanut butter brands. Almond butter wasn't particularly popular yet, much less the flavor combinations Justin's was selling, like maple almond or chocolate hazelnut.

So, despite positive feedback from customers, Justin's had yet to turn a profit — and Gold was still waiting tables and working a retail job to make ends meet, he said.

Within two years of introducing nut butters in tiny pouches, Justin's was profitable and Gold soon quit his day jobs, he told Entrepreneur in 2012. The business was acquired by Hormel Foods in 2016 for $280.9 million, according to an SEC filing from that year.

Here's what the company reported compared to Wall Street expectations, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 70 cents, adjusted vs. 68 cents expected.

70 cents, adjusted vs. 68 cents expected. Revenue: $22.1 billion vs. $23.74 billion expected.

Bank of America said its net income fell to $3.1 billion, or 35 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, down more than 50% from $7.1 billion, or 85 cents per share, a year ago.

The bank, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, said it was hit by a pretax charge of $1.6 billion in the quarter related to the transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate. The results also included a special $2.1 billion fee charged by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The fee is tied to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Excluding items, the company said it earned 70 cents per share, which outpaced analysts' expectations.

However, revenue of $22.1 billion fell short of Wall Street's estimates for the first time in two years and was down 10% from the year-ago period.

""We reported solid fourth quarter and full-year results as all our businesses achieved strong organic growth, with record client activity and digital engagement,"" CEO Brian Moynihan said in a statement. ""Our expense discipline allowed us to continue investing in growth initiatives. Strong capital and liquidity levels position us well to continue to deliver responsible growth in 2024.""

The nation's second-largest bank posted a $1.1 billion provision for credit losses, up $12 million from the same quarter last year.

Bank of America said its net interest income decreased 5% to $13.9 billion due to higher deposit costs and lower deposit balances, which more than offset higher asset yields.

The bank was supposed to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of higher interest rates last year, but it has underperformed its peers because the lender had piled into low-yielding, long-dated securities during the Covid-19 pandemic. Those securities lost value as interest rates climbed.

Revenue from consumer banking dipped 4% to $10.3 billion, while sales and trading revenue went up 3% to $3.6 billion.

Bank of America stock is down 2.6% this year after a mere 1.7% gain in 2023. The S&P 500 financial sector gained 10% last year.

Who's this for? With about 5,400 physical locations and over 13,000 ATMs, Wells Fargo Bank is the largest brick-and-mortar bank in the nation by the number of branches. For those looking to open an account at a bank with the most opportunity for in-person access, Wells Fargo is your best choice. Wells Fargo offers two different savings accounts: the basic Way2Save® Savings and the elevated Platinum Savings. CNBC Select chose Way2Save as the better savings account option because it has a lower minimum daily balance requirement to avoid the monthly service fee ($5 per month for Way2Save and $12 per month for Platinum). To avoid these fees, account holders must either maintain a $300 minimum daily balance or set up their choice of automatic transfers from their checking to their savings: $25 in total, $1 each business day per month or at least one Save As You Go® transfer. With Save As You Go, it's easy to set aside cash. Wells Fargo automatically transfers $1 of a customer's funds from their linked Wells Fargo checking account to their Way2Save account for each qualifying transaction that is a non-recurring debit card purchase or online bill payment using Wells Fargo Online® Bill Pay. To accelerate completing your savings goals, you can set up additional automatic transfers from your checking account each month. There is a $25 minimum opening deposit for this savings account, and those who link a Wells Fargo checking account can opt for overdraft protection. The APY on this account is currently 0.15%.

Who's this for? If you are looking for a broad network of ATMs to avoid any out-of-network fees and want a chance to earn a slightly higher APY, consider the savings accounts offered by Chase. Chase Bank has nearly 4,900 branches and 16,000 ATMs. Like Wells Fargo, Chase offers two brick-and-mortar savings accounts: the standard Chase Savings℠ and the Chase Premier Savings℠. CNBC Select ranked the latter as one of the best because you can earn better interest rates (what Chase calls ""relationship rates"") on higher balances by linking your savings to a Chase Premier Plus Checking℠ or Chase Sapphire℠ Checking and making at least five transactions in a month using your linked checking account. If you don't link your Chase Premier Savings account to a Chase checking account, the APY is 0.01%. But the APY creeps up slightly if you do have a linked account. For example, you can earn 0.02% APY if you also have a Premier Plus Checking or Chase Sapphire Checking account. By linking to a checking account, you also avoid the monthly $25 service fee that comes with the Chase Premier Savings. Otherwise, there's a daily minimum balance of $15,000 required. There is no minimum deposit required to open an account. If you choose to link a Chase Sapphire Checking account, you can take advantage of Sapphire℠ Banking perks, which include special access to sports and entertainment events and early ticket sales. Chase also has an automatic savings program where customers can get help reaching their set savings goals in the bank's mobile app. There is a $5 savings withdrawal limit fee when you make over six withdrawals in a month, including those made at a branch or at an ATM. This fee is waived with a balance of $15,000 or more in the account at the time of withdrawal.

Potential savers can open an account with a $25 minimum deposit. The monthly maintenance fee is $4 a month. The fee is waived for account holders who have a $300 minimum daily balance, a $1,000 average monthly collected balance or are under 18.

Who's this for? The Citi® Savings Account is ideal for those who appreciate robust digital banking features but still want access to physical branches. Citibank is the nation's third-largest bank but has far fewer branches than some competitors, with only about 700 branches in the U.S. Customers have access to over 65,000 surcharge-free ATMs in the U.S. and can take advantage of a range of online banking features, including mobile check deposit, hassle-free transfers and easy online bill payments. Citi stands out for offering a higher APY than its brick-and-mortar competitors, with a 0.05% APY for basic customers and the potential to earn up to 1.01% APY depending on your Citi account tier. There is no minimum deposit required to open an account. Customers can avoid paying the low monthly fee by maintaining a minimum daily balance of at least $500 or linking their savings account to their checking account and either making one enhanced direct deposit and one qualifying bill payment per statement period or maintaining a $1,500 average monthly collected balance.

Who's this for? PNC Bank is a large brick-and-mortar bank with approximately 2,300 branch locations and nearly 18,000 PNC and PNC Partner ATMs. It stands out on our list for its savings account option called Virtual Wallet®, which uses innovative online tools to make it easy to see how you're managing your money day to day. The account is best for those who want to do all their banking in one place as it rewards you for combining your savings and checking into one. New account holders can earn a welcome bonus of up to $400 depending on what type of Virtual Wallet they open. The three choices include Virtual Wallet, Virtual Wallet with Performance Spend and Virtual Wallet with Performance Select. The simple Virtual Wallet has basic account features while the two other options offer more premium rewards. For those enrolled in school, there is also a Virtual Wallet Student option. All of the above Virtual Wallet options include individual accounts that work together: Spend, Reserve and Growth. Spend is your everyday checking account, Reserve your interest-bearing checking account / primary overdraft protection account and Growth is your long-term savings account / secondary overdraft protection account. Higher ""relationship"" interest rates are available on your Growth savings account. The monthly service charges range from $7 to $25, depending on the type of Virtual Wallet you have and can be waived depending on minimum balances in your Spend + Reserve checking accounts (required balances and minimum deposits vary according to the type of Virtual Wallet you have). Virtual Wallet account holders can make free transactions at approximately 9,000 PNC-owned ATMs, and if you end up using a non-PNC ATM, some fees are reimbursed. Through the PNC Purchase Payback® program, customers can also earn cash back or points on purchases made using their PNC Bank Visa® Debit Card which is automatically issued when they sign up for Virtual Wallet. The customized rewards program has offers available from participating merchants depending on your shopping habits. Though you can open a Virtual Wallet account online, being a brick-and-mortar bank, PNC also welcomes customers to visit their local branch to open an account and offers a coupon printout of the welcome bonus that savers can bring with them to redeem. For current APY information, call 1-888-PNC-BANK (1-888-762-2265). If you're looking for a more straightforward account, PNC Bank also offers a Standard Savings Account.

Why trust CNBC Select?

At CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money. Every brick-and-mortar savings account review is based on rigorous reporting by our team of expert writers and editors with extensive knowledge of banking products. While CNBC Select earns a commission from affiliate partners on many offers and links, we create all our content without input from our commercial team or any outside third parties, and we pride ourselves on our journalistic standards and ethics. See our methodology for more information on how we choose the best big bank savings accounts.

Our methodology

To determine which big bank savings accounts are best, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. savings accounts offered by the largest national banks and credit unions. We narrowed down our ranking by only considering those savings accounts that come from big banks with broad availability, offering access to at least 700 physical branches and over 4,000 non-fee ATMs in the U.S. While the accounts we chose in this article are from the largest banks, we compared each savings account on a range of features, including its fees, opportunities to earn higher interest rates, customer service and any other special offerings or programs. We also considered factors such as insurance policies, users' deposit options, other savings accounts being offered by the same bank and customer reviews when available. All of the accounts included on this list are FDIC-insured up to $250,000. Note that the interest rates and fee structures for brick-and-mortar savings accounts are subject to change without notice. Product and feature availability vary by market so they may not be offered depending on where you live. Most brick-and-mortar banks require you to enter your zip code online for the correct account offerings. Any return on your savings depends on the associated fees and the balance you have in your brick-and-mortar savings account. To open a savings account, most banks and institutions require a deposit of new money, meaning you can't transfer money you already had in an account at that bank.

Despite a bounce this month, the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks has slipped a fraction this year while the large-cap S & P 500 has climbed almost 7%. Against that underperformance, Bank of America strategist Jill Carey Hall recently screened for small-cap value names with strong fundamentals. She scanned the Russell 2000 for profitable stocks that are in the top 20th percentile on one or more valuation metrics, including price-to-book, price-to-earnings and enterprise value-to-sales ratios. Beyond that, they also must fall within the top 40th percentile on average across all of the indicators. Here are 10 stocks that passed Bank of America's screen: Online ticket platform Vivid Seats landed in the top quintile on both the ratio of price to free cash flow and price to trailing earnings. The stock has struggled recently, slipping more than 5% this year after losing more than 13% in 2023. After those losses, Wall Street sees a rebound ahead. The average analyst polled by FactSet has an overweight rating and price target implying shares can jump more than 78% in the next year. One of those bullish analysts is Ryan Sigda of Craig-Hallum. He initiated coverage of the stock earlier this month with a buy rating. ""We think the company's competitive moat continues to increase with its unique loyalty program, investments into platform expansions ... , and TAM expansions,"" he wrote to clients, referencing the company's total addressable market. Retailer Urban Outfitters is another consumer name that passed the screen. The stock placed within the top 20% of the Russell 2000 when looking at the enterprise value to sales ratio. Urban Outfitters has bucked the downtrend among small-caps this year, with shares up more than 22% in 2024 after surging nearly 50% last year. URBN .RUT YTD mountain Urban Outfitters vs. the Russell 2000, year to date But Wall Street foresees a pullback, with the average price target of analysts surveyed by FactSet showing shares could fall more than 5%. The typical analyst also has a hold rating on the stock. Automotive electronics supplier Visteon also made the list, faling in the top quintile for enterprise value to sales. The stock has underperformed both small caps and the broader market this year, dropping more than 6%. Earlier this month, the Michigan-based company reported weaker revenue for the fourth quarter than Wall Street expected. Visteon also offered soft sales guidance for the full year. Still, analysts expect Visteon to rebound.

Stocks are coming off a breathtaking year that saw a return to growth-oriented names after a gruesome 2022. The S & P 500 rallied 24% while the Nasdaq Composite surged 43% for its best year since 2020 as Wall Street bet big on artificial intelligence. Here are some of the firm's top picks: Bank of America is optimistic on Humana in the new year despite some market concerns about the health insurance company's path to $37 in earnings per share in 2025. The firm's price target implies 40% upside from Friday's close, with analyst Kevin Fischbeck viewing a potential merger with Cigna as ""validation of the core growth story ahead."" On the financial front, Bank of America projects about 17% upside for shares of Citigroup as Wall Street obtains greater visibility into the company's core earnings trajectory. Recent cost-cutting and efficiency measures should also boost investor confidence and offer a potential tailwind for the stock, wrote Ebrahim Poonawala. ""We believe Citigroup (C) shares offer a compelling risk/reward given the potential for idiosyncratic EPS levers 'self-help' that should lead to an improved ROTCE (return on tangible common equity) on the back of CEO Jane Fraser's actions to transform the franchise,"" he wrote. Automotive seating company Lear and railroad operator Union Pacific also made Bank of America's list of long ideas for the first quarter. Meanwhile, the Wall Street firm highlighted underperform-rated Tractor Supply as a potential short idea for the first quarter. Analyst Jason Haas recently downgraded shares, citing a post-pandemic reversion in the farming industry, a deflationary commodity cycle and declining herd sizes. ""Although the company is well positioned in the farm & ranch store industry, we're concerned that soft discretionary demand and deflation will suppress earnings growth in the near-term,"" he said. The firm's $171 price target implies 20% downside from Friday's close. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",1/2/2024,0,0.000554885,0.997630596,0.000502867,0.000702855,0.000296931,0.000311777

""For 30 years, fixed income was a hedge,"" said Rieder, the asset manager's global chief investment officer of fixed income, in a phone call with CNBC. The circumstances have changed since then, as the Federal Reserve set off on its policy-tightening campaign in March 2022, eventually leading to a fed funds target rate of 5.25% to 5.5%. Central bank policymakers, including Fed Chair Jerome Powell, have been adamant about the "" lack of further progress "" on inflation this year, suggesting that rates will likely stay high for awhile. That in his view could call for a fresh approach to the traditional 60/40 asset allocation, which aims to offer diversification but hit a rough patch in 2022 when bonds and equities suffered price declines. ""How you build balance in a portfolio and how you use fixed income has to be different,"" Rieder said. A 60/30/10 split Rather than a 60/40 split toward equities and fixed income, Rieder said he would consider a 60/30/10 allocation if he were to build a balanced portfolio. That is, he'd maintain a 60% allocation toward stocks, but keep 30% of the portfolio in ""higher income, shorter duration"" assets. Duration is a measurement of a bond's price sensitivity to fluctuations in interest rates, and issues with longer maturities tend to have greater duration. Rieder said he would commit the remaining 10% toward other holdings including bespoke private credit and some alternatives. An asset class that fits the bill in the ""higher income, shorter duration"" bucket would be highly rated collateralized loan obligations, Rieder said. ""You can create real yield that's in the [6% range] for a triple A asset without taking a lot of long-term interest rate [risk],"" he added. So-called CLOs are securitized pools of floating-rate loans to businesses, which can include loans to non-investment grade borrowers. The AAA-rated tranches are the least risky in the CLO space, as they are first to get paid in the event a company goes bankrupt. CLO exchange-traded funds recently came under Bank of America's coverage , and strategist Jared Woodard noted that floating-rate loans have bolstered the performance of CLOs in a higher-for-longer rates backdrop. In addition to these assets, Rieder likes European investment-grade credit as a U.S. dollar investor. ""They are super high quality, and you get a nice yield of 5.5% to 6%,"" he said. ""The big secret is that people underestimate that cash flow really works, income really works, and if you're not taking a lot of risk, it becomes a good supplement to your portfolio,"" Rieder said.",4/19/2024,0,0.015421852,0.887930214,0.002962966,0.083961613,0.007866235,0.001857136

FAQs Can a sole proprietor get a business credit card? A small business owner who is a sole proprietor is eligible for business credit cards. Many business card applications allow you to use your social security number as your business tax ID and don't require you to have an LLC or other complicated business structure. Can I use my EIN to get a business credit card? You can use an Employer Identification Number (EIN) to apply for a business credit card as a sole proprietor. However, most business cards for sole proprietors require a personal guarantee, so reviews of your personal credit history and income are part of the application process. Do business credit card applications verify personal income? Most small business card applications require you to provide your personal income and social security number. The card issuer can use this information to determine your credit limit and whether you can afford the card's monthly payments.

Bottom line

Sole proprietors are eligible for most types of small business credit cards, including cards that earn cash-back, travel rewards and offer no-interest intro periods. You'll usually need a good to excellent credit score to qualify for the most rewarding cards, but if you have a lower credit score, some of the easiest business credit cards to get only require an average or fair credit score.

If there was any doubt before, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has pretty much cemented the likelihood that there won't be interest rate reductions anytime soon.

Now, Wall Street is wondering if the central bank will cut at all this year.

That's because Powell on Tuesday said there's been ""a lack of further progress"" on lowering inflation back to the Fed's 2% target, meaning ""it's likely to take longer than expected"" to get enough confidence to start easing back on policy.

""They've got the economy right where they want it. They now are just focused on inflation numbers. The question is, what's the bar here?"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""My sense is they need two, probably three consecutive months of inflation numbers that are consistent with that 2% target. If that's the bar, the earliest they can get there is September. I just don't see rate cuts before that.""

With most readings putting inflation around 3% and not moving appreciably for several months, the Fed finds itself in a tough slog on the last mile toward its goal.

Market pricing for rate cuts has been highly volatile in recent weeks as Wall Street has chased fluctuating Fed rhetoric. As of Wednesday afternoon, traders were pricing in about a 71% probability that the central bank indeed most likely will wait until September, with the implied chance of a July cut at 44%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.

As for a second rate cut, there was a tilt toward one in December, but that remains an open question.

""Right now, my base case is two — one in September and one in December, but I could easily see one rate cut, in November,"" said Zandi, who thinks the presidential election could factor into the equation for Fed officials who insist they are not swayed by politics.",4/17/2024,0,0.011668881,0.748590469,0.003210022,0.133610353,0.097336724,0.005583602

Rate cut expectations moved out to later in the year after a hotter-than-expected January consumer price index raised concern that the Federal Reserve's road to its 2% inflation target could be a bumpy one. According to the CME FedWatch Tool , markets are now assigning a greater chance of an easing cycle starting in May or June, instead of in March. At the same time, the 10-year Treasury yield topped 4.3% on Tuesday, a level it last reached in December. It eased slightly on Wedneaday to 4.25%. US10Y 1Y mountain U.S. 10-Year Treasury For regional banks, a move higher in bond yields is especially risky as institutions would have to mark losses in their Treasury holdings, an event that led to Silicon Valley Bank going under last March. ""Fewer and later Fed rate cuts pose downside risk to bank stocks,"" analyst Ebrahim Poonawala wrote in a Tuesday note. ""We are especially concerned about the failure of the broader market to project the trajectory of interest rates – a consistent theme since the Fed began raising interest rates in March 2022."" ""We worry about the risk from no rate cuts in 2024 and a far more elevated level of interest rates across the UST yield curve,"" Poonawala added. The SPDR S & P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) ended Tuesday's session down by 4.2%, and has dropped more than 10% this year. KRE YTD mountain SPDR S & P Regional Banking ETF ""Fundamentally it has the potential to lead to a worse-than-expected credit cycle, squeeze net interest margins (= downside risk to EPS outlooks), while pressuring capital levels due to [mark-to-market] losses on bonds,"" Poonawala wrote. Net interest margin is the difference between the interest banks earn on loans and pay on deposits. Meanwhile, mark-to-market losses on bonds are generated when the current value of an asset is lower than what the institution paid to acquire them. Instead, the analyst said it prefers larger-cap banks with lower commercial real estate exposure such as JPMorgan , Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon . In the regional sector, the firm said it prefers Truist , U.S. Bancorp and First Bancorp (Puerto Rico) , among others. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",2/14/2024,0,0.043057904,0.120192967,0.003882364,0.665462673,0.164989829,0.002414268

An insurer has to be financially healthy to be able to pay out claims. As an independent credit rating agency, A.M. Best translates balance sheets and other data into letter grades that can be understood by consumers, investors and others in the insurance industry. A.M. Best reviews and rates over 16,000 insurance companies globally, from household names to niche providers. Grades range from A+ to D, and each grade may also have a notch (or an additional ""+"") to indicate its strength within that grade. For example, an A+ company with an outstanding ability to meet its obligations would be categorized as A++. A.M. Best's grades are relevant to all kinds of insurance. A life insurance policy, for example, may not pay out for decades. So it's important for a life insurance company to be in good financial standing for the long haul. Northwestern Mutual, New York Life and MassMutual all received A++ ratings from A.M. Best in 2023.

How does A.M. Best rate insurance companies?

A.M. Best grades insurers' credit in several categories, including their ability to meet their short- term, long-term and ongoing financial obligations. It's best known for its financial strength ratings (FSRs), however, which look at a company's ability to meet all of its policy and contract obligations. According to A.M. Best, the ratings are predictions based on balance sheet strength, performance, business profile information and other data. As such, they're not a guarantee of future performance or meant as investment advice. To calculate ratings, A.M. Best says its analysts make ""quantitative and qualitative evaluations of balance sheet strength, operating performance, business profile and enterprise risk management"" and bring their findings to a committee, which votes on a rating recommendation.

What is the A.M. Best rating scale?

A.M. Best grades insurance companies on financial health by assigning them letter grades ranging from A+ to D. These grades can also include a notch to further distinguish financial strength within a grade. An A+ company with superior financial strength, for example, would be graded as A++. And a B company with less solvency could be graded as B-. These are the grade categories, based on A.M. Best's belief in a company's ability to meet ongoing obligations. Superior : Rating: A+, Notches: A++

: Rating: A+, Notches: A++ Excellent : Rating: A, Notches: A-

Rating: C+, Notches: C++ Weak : Rating: C, Notches: C-

: Rating: C, Notches: C- Poor: Rating: D An Under Review modifier, or ""U,"" may also be added to a company's grade if there is a potential for a near-term change to its score, usually within the next six months. The Under Review marker can imply positive or negative results. Under review with positive implications: There is a reasonable likelihood the grade will be raised as a result of recent information.

There is a reasonable likelihood the grade will be raised as a result of recent information. Under review with negative implications: The company is facing unfavorable financial or market conditions and has a good possibility of a rating downgrade.

The company is facing unfavorable financial or market conditions and has a good possibility of a rating downgrade. Under review with developing implications: There is still uncertainty as to the outcome of the review.

How to use A.M. Best's ratings

FSRs distill a lot of financial information into an accessible format, providing an important metric you can use to evaluate an insurance company. To ensure a score is current and accurate, get it from the A.M Best website directly.

Major carriers like State Farm and Allstate have numerous subsidiaries for property, auto and other insurance categories and A.M. Best grades each separately. Make sure you're looking at the right one.

Look beyond the score to the factors that led A.M Best to give a company its grade and notch to see if they concern you.

Review an insurer's grade over time for an idea of its long-term financial health.

Look at scores from other credit rating agencies for comparison, including S&P Global and Moody's. FSRs shouldn't be the sole reason to purchase or switch to a particular carrier, especially since they don't consider rates and terms for a specific policy. They also don't address customer satisfaction — the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Complaint Index, J.D. Power's customer satisfaction ratings and the Better Business Bureau's grades are more helpful there. Shop for your next homeowners insurance policy

""Hershey is facing headwinds from record-high cocoa prices, which we expect to limit near-term earnings growth,"" wrote analyst Brittany Quatrochi as she downgraded shares to a hold rating. To be sure, Quatrochi expects Hershey to partially offset elevated cocoa prices by hiking prices and downsizing sizes. New product innovations and international growth should also drive sales growth. ""These long-term positives are balanced by our belief that it will take several years for Hershey to offset higher cocoa costs, which we expect to weigh on earnings growth in the near term,"" she wrote.

Analyst Rob Sanderson initiated coverage of DoorDash with a buy rating and $170 price target, citing strong execution. ""We think that years of debate over viability and earnings potential of on-demand gig platforms has been settled,"" he wrote. ""Industry leaders like DoorDash have demonstrated continued momentum postpandemic and the ramp in free cash generation is undeniable."" DoorDash shares have rallied more than 31% so far this year, with the firm's $170 price target suggesting that shares can rally another 31% from here. ""While DoorDash carries a valuation premium vs. many peers, it is justified by a higher growth rate, best-in-class execution and earnings power that we think is meaningfully understated by investment in new categories, new regions and new products,"" Sanderson said. – Samantha Subin 6:48 a.m.: Wolfe Research upgrades Bank of America as net interest income reaches an 'inflection' Now is the time to buy shares of Bank of America, according to Wolfe Research. Analyst Steven Chubak upgraded Bank of America to an outperform rating, citing expectations for a net interest income turnaround and a discounted valuation. ""While some of these NII pressures should persist in a higher-for-longer rate backdrop, with BAC's 1Q24 results reflecting better asset repricing trends … we believe that we're now approaching the point of NII inflection where ""under-earning"" banks including both BAC and SCHW should post stronger gains following multiple years of underperformance,"" he wrote. Shares of Bank of America have added 6% this year, with the firm's $42 price targets suggesting that shares can rally another 17%. Along with improving net interest income, Chubak also noted that Bank of America appears to be gaining market share in trading and investment banking, which should bode well for fee growth. ""Combined with a discounted valuation and the capacity to repurchase ~16% of market capitalization through YE25 (by our estimates), we are more confident in BAC's ability to drive durable EPS growth over the next few years,"" he wrote. – Samantha Subin 6:28 a.m.: Wells Fargo upgrades First Solar to overweight, says shares can surge more than 40% Investors should consider snatching up ""port in the storm"" stock First Solar, according to Wells Fargo.

""While it's hard to predict which of the following regulations will pass, at a minimum, we see many ways in which FSLR could maintain [average selling prices] through the end of the decade (implies a $340/sh stock price) and a few scenarios in which [average sales prices] increase further from here (implies at least a $390/sh stock price),"" he wrote. Blum cites a slew of catalysts for the upgrade, including the expectation that The Biden Administration will revoke tariff exemption of bifacial modules used in solar and potential trade restrictions on Chinese panels. New proposals would also bar solar companies based in China from obtaining Inflation Reduction Act credits. Blum's adjusted $250 price target implies that shares can rally 43% from Thursday's close. The stock added 1% before the bell and is up 1% this year. Alongside the upgrade, Blum downgraded Sunnova Energy to an equal weight rating and slashed his price target to $6 from $11, citing a higher-for-longer rate environment.

""Share gains upmarket by Shopify support confidence in the durability of growth against tempered consumer spending expectations,"" wrote analyst Keith Weiss. ""A disciplined view on headcount provides room for further operating leverage against more measured expectations, supporting our upgrade to Overweight."" Shares of the Canada-based e-commerce company jumped about 3% before the bell on the upgrade. The stock has tumbled 11% this year, but could rally 22% based on the firm's adjusted $85 price target. SHOP YTD mountain SHOP year to date Underpinning the firm's overweight rating is a bet that Shopify will expand its international traction and hold onto 20% growth even as consumer expectations moderate. Weiss also estimates that advertising can add 100 basis points to the company's take rate by 2030, while a ""largely flat headcount"" should benefit 2024 operating margins. The take rate refers to the fees collected on a sale. ""Despite questions around the durability of Shopify's operating margin expansion following Q4 results, we believe investor expectations have over corrected and commentary pointing to modest headcount expansion in FY24 still leaves room for further realization of operating leverage and FCF growth in the business,"" Weiss wrote. — Samantha Subin 5:53 a.m.: Canaccord Genuity downgrades Netflix, cites slower growth ahead Beware of slower growth ahead for Netflix , according to Canaccord Genuity. Analyst Maria Ripps downgraded the media giant to hold from buy after its first-quarter print, saying the company's paid sharing initiative ""meaningfully pulled forward member growth."" ""Despite these mostly solid results and outlook, we see limited growth catalysts for the next few quarters and with the stock up ~90% over the last 12 months and up ~25% YTD, we think investors may be well served to look elsewhere for upside and are downgrading the stock to hold,"" she wrote. Shares slumped nearly 6% before the bell even after Netflix topped first-quarter results and reported a 16% rise in total memberships in extended trading Thursday. NFLX 1D mountain NFLX falls Along with the results, Netflix also said it plans to stop reporting quarterly membership numbers and average revenue per member, which Ripps views as further contributing to this ""uncertainty."" ""We think this decision and the timing of when the company plans to sunset the disclosure indicates that member growth may become challenged in FY25, as paid sharing likely pulled forward member additions, although that benefit could still continue for another few quarters,"" she said. Despite the news, some Wall Street majors retained their overweight rating on the stock. Although net additions will likely subside in 2025, Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall expects average revenue per user to accelerate as Netflix's advertising program rolls out across the U.S. and Canada. Price hikes later this year in other countries and the continued build-out of Netflix's advertising tier should also help offset some pressures on average revenue per user, added JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth. Elsewhere, Morgan Stanley's Benjamin Swinburne viewed the results and outlook as a sign that the company can support 25% to 30% EPS growth. ""The business model transition put into place two years ago, when growth stalled, appears well on track,"" he wrote. ""Healthy double digit top-line growth looks sustainable beyond 2024."" – Samantha Subin 5:53 a.m.: Jefferies downgrades Ulta Beauty The competition against Ulta Beauty is heating up, and Jefferies thinks it could hurt the stock.

Following the trade, Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust will own 475 shares of EL, increasing its weighting to 2.1% from 1.9%. We're making a small buy in Estee Lauder and upgrading our rating to a 1. At Wednesday's closing price of $138 per share, the stock has essentially given back all of its gains from the post-earnings pop in February when CEO Fabrizio Freda declared the company has finally reached an ""inflection point"" and was positioned to return to strong organic sales growth and profitability in the second half of its fiscal year. We've been very patient about adding to Estee Lauder until we had more confidence that inventories in China and its travel retail channel have normalized. Any set back to the destocking process would likely cause management to push out when it expected to return to growth, causing the stock to fall. That's why we took notice Thursday when analysts at Deutsche Bank made a bullish call on Estee Lauder. Analysts at the firm named the stock of this prestige beauty company a ""Catalyst Call: Buy Idea,"" pointing to a positive setup into earnings May 1. The analysts think it's likely that Estee Lauder will report an in-line to better-than-expected result versus Wall Street estimates while reiterating guidance. To be sure, the strong dollar could cause a tweak to the downside, but investors will be more focused on the operational results given the challenges the company has had. Deutsche Bank also sees management speaking constructively about its market share while maintaining its commitment to its so-called Profit Recovery Plan. As a reminder, Estee Lauder expects this plan will increase operating profit by $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion. The plan began in the company's fiscal 2024 third quarter — the one that just concluded — and is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2026. All in, Deutsche Bank thinks the results and commentary ""would surpass market fears of a potential hiccup and spur relative relief in EL's stock price."" We agree with this view. Given the fact that Estee Lauder shares are trading only a few dollars above when Freda said the inflection point was here, we think this is a sign the market wants to see the proof before the stock gets the credit. If Deutsche Bank is right and Estee Lauder makes the number, we expect a stronger move higher in the stock as well. That being said, the company isn't out of the woods just yet. Deutsche Banks acknowledges that the company still faces longer-term questions about category demand and execution. We agree with this as well, which is why we are keeping this buy on the smaller side – this is still a high-risk, volatile situation. Getting inventories clean will represent a major milestone in the company's recovery, but we still have some lingering concerns about the Chinese consumer and the company's ability to retake market share in the United States. On the latter point, we are encouraged by some of the company's recent efforts to expand its consumer reach. We were pleasantly surprised to see Estee Lauder finally embrace Amazon and open a premium beauty store on the online platform. Other prestige beauty brands have found success on Amazon, and we think the same will happen for Estee Lauder. According to Deutsche Bank, the current bull-versus-bear debate is on what multiple the stock should trade on $6 of earnings per share over time. They see the bulls arguing for a 30-times earnings multiple as the company begins the road to recovery from here, while the bears think it should be closer to 20 because they think the recovery will inevitably find problems. We fall on the more bullish side now that inventories have come down and management has a plan in place to boost profits and innovation. That said, we prefer to err a little more cautiously than those bulls. That's why we are using a 27 multiple on those $6 of earnings, which puts our price target at $162. Lastly, this buy falls in line with our investing discipline of putting money to work in the market when it is heavily oversold. Following Wednesday's decline in the market, the S & P 500 Short Range Oscillator moved deeper into oversold territory at -6.68%. As a reminder, we view an oversold market as a sign that stocks have fallen fast and we need to start thinking about the selloff more and more opportunistically.

All times ET. 7:50 a.m.: Cost cuts will lead to higher profits at Amazon, Needham says Amazon's cost-cutting actions should quickly fall through to the tech giant's bottom line, according to Amazon analyst Laura Martin. In a note to clients Thursday, Needham hiked its estimate for Amazon's 2024 fiscal year earnings per share by 12%. The estimate now shows a year-over-year gain of 43%. ""The catalyst for this note is to raise our FY24 profit ests for AMZN, based on CEO Andy Jassy's shareholder letter promising more cost-cutting at AMZN's inbound fulfillment architecture and inventory placement during FY24. We also expect FY23's cost-cutting actions to drive margin expansion throughout FY24,"" Martin said. Amazon is set to report its first quarter earnings on April 30. Needham has a buy rating on Amazon with a price target of $205 per share, implying upside of roughly 13%. Martin said that Amazon projects to be one of just a few major winners from artificial intelligence. ""AMZN is developing GenAI chips to train and drive better inferences from LLMs (large language models), AND it has the widest variety of choices related to LLMs, because it offers a captive O & O (owned & operated) LLM, and its also hosts dozens of other LLMs of various sizes,"" Martin said. — Jesse Pound 7:38 a.m.: Loop Capital downgrades BJ's Wholesale Club, believes stock has reached fair value A year-to-date rally has boosted shares of BJ's Wholesale Club to fair value, according to Loop Capital. The financial firm downgraded the membership warehouse club to a hold rating from buy. Analyst Laura Champine also lowered her price target to $80 from $85, implying a 6% increase for the stock. In the note, Champine wrote that her in-line earnings and sales estimates no longer support a buy rating for the stock. The analyst cited inflation as a key concern for the company. ""We are concerned that BJ's stock may hit a wall as investors see evidence of still-high inflationary pressures on the company's core consumer,"" she wrote. ""We see risk to management's expectation for a 20 bps lift in merchandise margin as inflation stays firm on grocery categories."" Additionally, Champine noted ""mixed"" performance at the store level. On one hand, BJ's patio furniture and apparel mix looks ""much more attractive,"" with the company's merchant making solid choices likely to drive cross-category purchases. ""That said, we still see room for improvement,"" the analyst added. ""The mix of incremental improvements and unforced errors is likely to translate to in-line comps in our view, with less upside potential than we'd need for a Buy rating given BJ's YTD outperformance."" BJ's Wholesale Club stock has risen 13% this year. Champine noted that strong membership metrics stand to protect the stock's current valuation, which is trading around its fair price. — Lisa Kailai Han 7:23 a.m.: Tesla gets a downgrade from Deutsche Bank The tough times will continue for Tesla , according to Deutsche Bank. Analyst Emmanuel Rosner downgraded the electric vehicle maker to hold from buy. He also slashed his price target to $123 from $189. The new forecast implies downside of 20.9% over the next 12 months. The downgrade comes after a Reuters report earlier this month said Tesla had canceled plans to build a low-cost car, known as the Model 2, due to increasing competition in China. The car, according to the report, would have started at about $25,000. CEO Elon Musk said that that Reuters was ""lying"" but did not elaborate. ""The delay of Model 2 efforts creates the risk of no new vehicle in Tesla's consumer lineup for the foreseeable future, which would put continued downward pressure on its volume and pricing for many more years, requiring downward earnings estimate revisions for 2026+,"" Rosner wrote. Tesla shares were down more than 1% in the premarket. For the year, the stock has fallen more than 35%. TSLA YTD mountain TSLA year to date — Fred Imbert 7:16 a.m.: BMO Capital Markets sees upside for SL Green Realty as NYC commercial real estate recovers With a recovery on the horizon for the New York City commercial real estate space, shares of SL Green Realty look poised to rise, according to BMO Capital Markets. The financial services firm upgraded shares of the real estate investment trust, which focuses on commercial properties in Manhattan, to an outperform rating. Analyst John Kim also lifted his price target to $58 from its previous $56. This updated price target is nearly 17% higher than where shares of SL Green closed on Wednesday. As a catalyst, Kim cited an improving backdrop for the New York City commercial real estate space due to higher utilization and relocation of tech workers and graduate students. ""New York City office is one of the few REIT subsectors seeing improved demand,"" the analyst wrote. ""SLG continues to exhibit strong leasing momentum, which we believe will lead to improved occupancy and Net Debt / EBITDA."" While SL Green's biggest risk has been its exposure to a high amount of debt maturities and high leverage, Kim noted that the firm has been taking the necessary steps to address this issue through debt refinancing. Upcoming catalysts for the stock also include asset disposition of at least $4.5 billion, the closing of an opportunistic debt fund and a maturing lease. Shares of SL Green Realty are up 10% this year. — Lisa Kailai Han 7:12 a.m.: KeyBanc upgrades Zscaler to overweight, citing waning competitive pressures More favorable factors have painted a bright outlook for Zscaler ahead, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets. The firm upgraded the cloud security stock to overweight from its previous sector weight rating. KeyBanc also established a $220 price target for the stock, which corresponds to a 27% upside from Zscaler's Wednesday close. Analyst Eric Heath cited positive consumer sentiment towards the firm as a reason for the upgrade. He also believes that while Zscaler's competitive concerns are still valid, their potential impact on the company's sales cycles and win rates have lessened greatly. Additionally, the analyst sees catalysts to Zscaler's adoption of the Secure Access Service Edge cloud architecture model. The firm has made the model, also known as SASE, an increasing priority in the future. ""Ongoing weakness in firewall suggests network security budgets may orient toward SASE,"" Heath wrote. The analyst compared the company's favorable risk/reward to being able to see the forest through the trees. Shares of Zscaler have slipped 22% this year. — Lisa Kailai Han 6:53 a.m.: Morgan Stanley double upgrades eBay, sees 25% upside ahead Generative artificial intelligence might be what's needed to reinvigorate eBay , according to Morgan Stanley. The bank double-upgraded the e-commerce platform to overweight from underweight and hiked its price target to $62 from $35. This updated price target implies that eBay could rise 25% from its current levels. Analyst Nathan Feather said eBay has reached an inflection point in terms of its current performance – and sees upside for the stock going forward. ""We are turning more positive on EBAY as it appears to have found a trough with GMV [gross merchandise volume] growth, active customers, and margins stabilizing in FY24,"" he wrote. Besides evolving its underlying strategy to more ""site-wide horizontal solutions,"" Feather also believes that generative AI features will help boost the stock. ""We are turning more positive as we believe the shift to scalable horizontal solutions such as AI-assisted listings can enable a balance of slight GMV acceleration while maintaining or expanding margins,"" he noted. Shares of eBay have risen 13% in 2024. Feather added that eBay stock is currently trading at a discount versus peers, with Etsy trading around 35% higher. EBAY YTD mountain EBAY year to date ""We believe this gap will narrow and EBAY can see positive estimate revisions and multiple expansion,"" the analyst said. — Lisa Kailai Han 6:50 a.m.: Evercore ISI names GE Vernova the 'key player' of electrification Evercore ISI has big hopes ahead for GE Vernova . The investment firm initiated the energy business — which spun off from General Electric earlier this month — at an outperform rating. Analyst James West's $174 price target implies that shares could rise 29% from Wednesday's close. Going forward, West thinks that GE Vernova could prove itself as ""the key player in the mission to electrify and decarbonize the power system."" The company can leverage its existing customer base and relationships to take advantage of its increasing total addressable market, which West estimated would grow to around $435 billion by 2030 from $265 billion. ""Investors have been waiting for a company like GE Vernova given its scale, competitive moat, positive adjusted EBITDA generation, and leverage to the electrification of everything mega theme,"" he wrote. West added that the company stands to benefit from rising demand and significant capital spend towards the energy transition and electricity grid in upcoming years. Not even counting rising data center and artificial intelligence usage requiring more power, the world will need 55% more electricity generation in 2040 compared to 2022, the analyst added. — Lisa Kailai Han 6:08 a.m.: JPMorgan upgrades JetBlue JPMorgan likes what it's seeing from JetBlue . The bank upgraded the airline to neutral from underweight. Analyst Jamie Baker has a $7 price target, which indicates upside of 2.5%. While JetBlue has rallied 23% this year, Baker wrote that the stock is the second least-liked airline, according to sell-side ratings. But as the airline's catalysts become even more clear in its upcoming earnings report and guidance, he expects sentiment around the stock to improve. Jetblue is slated to report earnings next week. JBLU YTD mountain JBLU year to date ""Simply put, for airline investors intrigued by the notion of a potential domestic turnaround, we expect JetBlue to largely monopolize the spotlight going forward,"" the analyst wrote. As one reason for the upgrade, Baker highlighted the company's new management, which lacks the ""high tolerance for loss production"" as JetBlue's previous CEO. Additionally, an activist shareholder has also joined the company. Additionally, the airline also has some solid fundamental business practices that are working in its favor. ""JetBlue's DNA aligns with our broader preference for loyalty, premium, and international exposure ... albeit with less vigor than the Big 3,"" the analyst wrote. ""While we continue to expect JetBlue margins to trail those of the Big 3, in turn limiting our enthusiasm for the stock, we believe the combination of JetBlue's New York real estate, established brand and management resolve may yield more turnaround momentum than elsewhere in the beleaguered domestic space."" — Lisa Kailai Han 5:47 a.m.: TD Cowen reiterates Nvidia as top pick The future looks even brighter for Nvidia , and TD Cowen expects the company's upcoming results to reflect that. The firm highlighted Nvidia as its top pick in a recent note. Analyst Matthew Ramsay reiterated his buy rating and $1,100 price target on the name. This implies that shares of Nvidia could rally 31% from its Wednesday close. Share of the tech titan and Magnificent Seven darling have already rallied 70% this year. But Ramsay said its ""full speed ahead"" for the chipmaker. ""Significant revenue and EPS growth are now largely expected following three consecutive quarters of the print coming in > $2B above previous company guidance,"" the analyst wrote. Although some investors will question the sustainability of demand for Nvidia, Ramsay is much more confident that ""all signs continue to point up"" for the stock. He pointed to Nvidia's March GPU Technology Conference, which highlighted its competitive advantage versus its peers, as well as its market-leading position as proof of its staying power. ""NVIDIA remains the top franchise in accelerated compute and AI ... and we are in the early innings of both paradigm shifts,"" he wrote. ""While valuation is above core semis, the suite of superior technology, long pedigree of innovation, and extensive growth-oriented investments should allow for strong, sustained, above-peer growth across a widening set of verticals."" Nvidia is slated to report earnings next month. — Lisa Kailai Han 5:47 a.m.: Morgan Stanley downgrades Match Growth in online dating is slowing, spelling trouble for Match Group , according to Morgan Stanley. Analyst Nathan Feather downgraded the Hinge and Tinder parent company to equal weight from overweight. He also cut his price target to $37 from $53, implying upside of 14.6%. ""After 2 years of underperformance, we step to the sidelines on online dating as user growth remains cloudy,"" Feather wrote. ""We believe that soft user growth is more attributable to a lack of innovation than saturation as ~70% of US singles actively looking for a relationship do not currently use online dating."" ""We are cautiously optimistic that innovation could reaccelerate user growth at Tinder and Bumble, especially as they have a wide slate of improvements to the core user experience planned for 2024,"" he added. ""However, visibility into the potential success of these initiatives is low and, as online dating is a momentum business, it will likely take some time to sustainably reaccelerate growth."" Match Group shares are down more than 11% year to date. Last year, the stock dropped 12%.

Amazon replaced Walgreens on Monday, marking the first change in the index since 2020. It comes less than six years after the U.S. and British pharmacy chain first joined the Dow, replacing General Electric. WBA mountain 2018-06-26 Walgreen's stock performance since joining the Dow But a coveted spot in the 30-stock Dow may not prove all it's cracked up to be for Amazon, which has surged more than 87% over the past year, helping to power the market higher alongside other megacap technology stocks. In fact, data shows that betting on a stock that's leaving the Dow is often a better trade for investors than buying shares of a stock that's entering the 127-year-old average. That could bode well for shares of Walgreens, which have been on a downward spiral for years, more than halving in value since joining the Dow. The stock dropped 28% in 2022, another 30% last year and is down more than 18% in the first two months of 2024. CNBC Pro used its stock screening tool to track the one-year performance of the last 10 stocks that went into the Dow versus the last 10 that left the blue-chip index. The search showed that stocks removed jump an average 23.3% in the following year, far outperforming the average 2.4% gain in those stocks that went in. Data from Ned Davis Research shows a similar pattern. Stocks removed from the Dow since 1972 jumped an average of 17.5% in the year after stocks left the Dow since 1972, while stocks that were new to the blue chips scored a 10% gain, NDR said. What history shows Alcoa was the best-performing stock among the last 10 outgoing Dow members. The aluminum stock, along with HP and Bank of America , was replaced by Nike , Visa and Goldman Sachs in 2013. In the year that followed, Alcoa surged 91% and HP added about 72% while Bank of America tacked on 18%. Of the three additions that year, Nike saw the largest share price appreciation: roughly 16%. Other companies that left the Dow also posted strong returns. RTX Corporation , Exxon Mobil and Pfizer were also ejected from the Dow in 2020, and in the year that followed, surged roughly 39%, 37% and 29%, respectively. Two of their replacements — Salesforce and Amgen — declined about 3% and 11%, respectively. Even Apple wasn't immune, falling more than 17% in the year following its elevation to the Dow. The trend isn't fail safe. For example, Honeywell International surged more than 40% one year after joining the Dow, while UnitedHealth rallied nearly 28%. General Electric , the last of the original 12 Dow stocks, plunged about 58% one year after leaving the average in 2018. AT & T and DuPont de Nemours fell more than 14% and 21%, respectively, in the year after getting booted from the Dow. — CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed reporting.",2/26/2024,0,0.039900742,0.901158929,0.002768815,0.047379553,0.006612022,0.002179866

Horton and more","Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading. Duolingo — The online language app company popped 5.3% after JPMorgan reiterated its overweight rating on the stock , saying it has an attractive risk/reward and potential upside for its first-quarter guide and 2024 outlook. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing — U.S.-traded shares of the Taiwanese chipmaker dropped 4.9% after the company noted that, although it did not experience structural damage, some wafers ""had to be scrapped"" after the earthquake in Taiwan earlier in April. Most of the lost production will be recovered in the second quarter, according to management. The company still beat revenue and profit expectations in the first quarter and forecasted healthy growth in 2024. JetBlue Airways — Shares jumped 4.1% after JPMorgan upgraded the airline to neutral from underperform, saying it likes its turnaround potential. Bitcoin miners – Shares of bitcoin mining companies rallied ahead of the widely anticipated ""halving,"" which cuts miners' main stream of revenue in half , as mandated by the Bitcoin code. Marathon Digital rose 2.7%, while Riot Platforms and Iris Energy gained 4%. CleanSpark , which is one of the only miners still up for the year, rallied 8.8%. Estee Lauder — Deutsche Bank added a short-term buy rating on the cosmetics giant, sending shares 4.9% higher. The firm positively views the setup into Estee Lauder's earnings, which are due May 1. Meta Platforms — The tech giant advanced 1.5% after striking a partnership with Google to include its search results in its new AI assistant, Meta Llama 3. Tesla — The electric vehicle manufacturer slid 3.6%, hitting its 52-week low, after Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner downgraded Tesla stock to hold from buy. Rosner pointed to a report from Reuters that said Tesla had canceled plans to build its inexpensive Model 2 car, which he said creates the risk of no new vehicle in Tesla's consumer lineup for the foreseeable future and would put continued downward pressure on the company's volume and pricing for many more years, lowering earnings. Barnes Group — The global industrial tech and aerospace stock jumped 9.3% after DA Davidson upgraded the company to buy from neutral, saying shares are attractive. Alaska Air Group — Shares of the airline jumped nearly 8.1% on better-than-expected first-quarter results.

Blackstone — The asset manager slipped 2.3% after lowering its dividend to 83 cents per share from 94 cents per share. Earnings in the first quarter came in at 98 cents per share, slightly higher than the LSEG consensus estimate of 96 cents per share. BJ's Wholesale Club — Loop Capital downgraded BJ's on valuation, sending the stock 3.6% lower. The firm lowered its estimates on the warehouse store company for merchandise same-store sales and gross margin. D.R. Horton — Shares added 0.1% after D.R. Horton exceeded expectations in its fiscal second quarter, posting earnings of $3.52 per share on revenue of $9.11 billion. Analysts polled by LSEG, meanwhile, expected the homebuilder to post earnings of $3.06 per share on revenue of $8.27 billion. eBay — The e-commerce stock rose 1% following a double upgrade at Morgan Stanley to overweight from underweight. The firm said eBay seems undervalued relative to its peer Etsy. Elevance Health — Shares jumped 3.2% after the health insurance company posted an earnings beat and raised its full-year guidance.

Following the trade, Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust will own 800 shares of ABT, increasing its weighting to roughly 2.8% from 2.45%. Abbott Laboratories on Wednesday reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, but its stock is trading lower in the premarket, opening the door for us to add to our position for the third time in recent weeks. In the three months ended March 31, Abbott's worldwide sales increased 2.2% year over year to roughly $10 billion, edging Wall Street estimates of about $9.88 billion, according to LSEG. Organic sales growth for the underlying base business, which excludes Covid-19 testing-related sales, continued its momentum, growing 10.8% year over year, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The performance was broad based. Organic sales in Abbott's Medical Devices segment led the way, increasing 14.3% on an annual basis, followed by Established Pharmaceuticals up 13.7%, Nutrition up 7.7% and Diagnostics up 5.4%. Abbott also beat on the bottom line, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.98 topping analyst estimates of $0.95, according to LSEG. Following the better-than-expected quarter, Abbott raised the low end of its full-year adjusted EPS and organic sales outlooks. The EPS guidance range moved to $4.55 to $4.70 from $4.50 to $4.70, while the organic sales growth range for the underlying base business increased to 8.5% to 10% from 8% to 10%. This second line is what's most important to us. The best way to look at the company is by analyzing its underlying business because it does not include Covid-related sales. Abbott is not going to get any credit in the market for Covid testing-related guidance raises, but it should if the underlying business is performing better than expected. The fact Abbott raised its full-year outlook at the low end is a good sign of what is in store this year. And yet its stock is down about $1 year to date, or nearly 1%, and trading lower by another $1 in the premarket Wednesday. Perhaps there is always someone looking for an outlook boost at both the low and high end of guidance, but that is not Abbott's way a few months into the year. We think this weakness on a strong quarter is an opportunity to add to our position. We initiated our Abbott stake in late January. Our two most-recent purchases came on March 15 and March 21 .

80,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/24/wall-street-is-getting-excited-about-these-chinese-stocks.html,BBY,Best Buy,Wall Street is getting excited about these Chinese stocks — and upgrading three to 'buy',"Investment analysts have upgraded at least three U.S.-listed Chinese stocks to buy so far this month. The positive view comes as the many Chinese companies are reporting earnings for the last three months of 2023 and the full year. While many analysts are skeptical China can meet its ""around 5%"" growth target for 2024 without further stimulus, the country did report better-than-expected economic data in retail sales, industrial production and fixed asset investment for the first two months of the year. Here are the Chinese stocks that analysts are turning bullish on: Tencent Music Entertainment — Citi upgraded the stock to buy on Wednesday with a price target of $13 a share, up nearly 18% from Tuesday's close. The company operates one of China's major alternatives to Spotify. TME's fourth quarter results beat expectations, helped by ""outperformance of online music"" revenues, the Citi report said. ""We believe TME's steady/resilient subscription music business with expanding capabilities of music value chain and ramp-up of long-form audio and diversified use case scenarios across multi-channels/devices would support [a] sustained growth outlook,"" the analysts added. Kingsoft Cloud — JPMorgan on March 10 upgraded the cloud services company to overweight, but trimmed its price target by 30 cents to $4.20 a share based on a lower revenue forecast. That's still about 30% above where Kingsoft Cloud shares closed Tuesday. JPMorgan expects the company will break even in the first quarter on an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization basis, and achieve break even for all of 2024 — the first time ever. That's contrary to the consensus view of an EBITDA loss, the analysts noted. Their optimistic case is based on revenue shifting to higher-margin sources such as Kingsoft's fast-growing business in artificial intelligence, as well as a decline in costs due to asset write-offs in the third quarter. Vnet Group — BofA on Tuesday upgraded the data center operator's stock to buy with a $2.70 price target, down from $3.90 previously but still more than 35% above where shares closed Tuesday. The analysts expect news of a local government contract and demand from short video companies to boost VNET's revenue in the years ahead. The company already operates data centers in more than 20 cities in China, according to the report. Analysts are also finding more reasons to turn incrementally optimistic about other Chinese stocks. Earlier this month, on March 10, JPMorgan upgraded shares of video streaming and gaming company Bilibili to neutral, from underweight, with a price target of $11, slightly below where shares closed Tuesday. The analysts expect Bilibili can reach its double-digit revenue growth target for the year with the help of new game releases. They also pointed out the company achieved two quarters of positive operating cashflow in 2023. ""With these catalysts, we think share price downside is limited in the next 3-6"" months, the report said.

Boeing said on Wednesday it would burn more cash in the first quarter than previously expected and pushed back a company cash-flow goal as it constrains 737 production to improve quality amid a worsening crisis at the U.S. planemaker.

CFO Brian West said Boeing would produce fewer than the maximum 38 737 aircraft allowed each month under a Federal Aviation Administration imposed limit.

Shares of the company were down 1% before the bell.

""We're deliberately going to slow to get this right,"" West told a Bank of America conference. ""We are the ones who made the decision to constrain rates on the 737 program...And we'll feel the impact of that over the next several months.""

Manufacturing quality at Boeing and major supplier Spirit AeroSystems is under scrutiny following a Jan. 5 incident in which a door plug blew off a 737 MAX 9 plane mid-flight. The two companies are now engaged in tie-up talks.

West added that Boeing's cash burn in the first quarter will be somewhere between $4 billion and $4.5 billion, ""higher than we originally planned back in January.""

That is due to a combination of lower deliveries, lower production volumes at its commercial division as well as some working capital pressure.

It will also take longer for Boeing to hit a goal outlined in 2022 of achieving annual cash flow of about $10 billion by 2025 or 2026.

""It's going to take us longer to get there than we planned,"" West said, without elaborating further. ""But we believe that the actions that we're taking right now better position us for that long term.""

West said margins at the commercial airplanes business would be ""more like negative 20%"" in the first quarter, in part due to customer compensation for delivery delays. They will improve through the year but still be negative overall in 2024, he added.

The CFO said that in future Boeing would only take deliveries of fully conforming fuselages from Spirit. Spirit currently assembles the fuselage for the 737 before it is shipped to a Boeing factory in Washington state to be completed.

The door panel that blew off the 737 MAX 9 jet appeared to be missing four key bolts, according to a preliminary report from U.S. investigators.

""For years, we prioritized the movement of the airplane through the factory over getting it done right, and that's got to change,"" West said.

On a possible buyout of Spirit, West said Boeing would fund any deal with a mix of cash and debt, rather than using stock.",3/20/2024,2,0.052793339,0.625014305,0.004182795,0.273320884,0.042330973,0.002357676

Goldman Sachs, meanwhile trimmed its price target on Boeing, citing several risks amid the company's ongoing safety issues. Check out the latest calls and chatter below. All times ET. 8:07 a.m.: Wells Fargo upgrades GoodRx, says shares can rally more than 50% It's time for investors turn constructive on shares of GoodRx , according to Wells Fargo. Analyst Stan Berenshteyn upgraded the digital healthcare stock to overweight from equal weight and upped his price target to $10, citing strong visibility into 2024 guidance and potential upside to estimates and valuation multiples. ""We think this sets up GoodRx to deliver on a beat & raise narrative in 2024 with upside to consensus expectations in 2025,"" Berenshteyn wrote. ""We expect this dynamic to help GDRX close the valuation gap to its peers (Ex.1), in turn setting up the stock to see meaningful outperformance over the next 12 months."" The updated price target suggests that shares can surge another 52% from Friday's close. The stock rallied about 7% before the bell and is down about 2% year to date. Underpinning the firm's thesis is a bet on improving visibility that should help counteract expectations for slower growth. Berenshteyn also expects EBITDA margins to come in ahead of consensus expectations in 2025. ""Net-net, we think GoodRx is positioned to execute consistently with revenue/margin risk skewed to the upside alongside prospects for a recovery in valuation multiples,"" he wrote. — Samantha Subin 7:51 a.m.: Citi hikes price target for Netflix, sees upside for subscriber growth Netflix's recent burst of subscriber growth will prove to be more than a short-term change from the password sharing crackdown, according to Citi.

We believe the outperformance has been driven by the firm's ad tier and password crackdown. Looking ahead, we expect the firm to continue to see healthy sub growth and see scope for consensus subscriber estimates to move higher,"" Bazinet wrote. ""We believe 1Q24 and 2Q24 net additions may be ~3 million too low. In addition, it suggests consensus 2024 net additions may be ~5 million too low, while net additions from 2025 through 2027 may be ~3 million too low,"" he added. Citi also raised the price target on Netflix to $660 from $550. The new price target is about 5% above where the stock closed Friday. Citi maintained its neutral rating on the stock. — Jesse Pound 7:49 a.m.: Wells Fargo upgrades Masimo on possible spinoff Wells Fargo upgraded Masimo to overweight from equal weight on Monday, citing the medical technology company's announcement Friday it is considering the separation of its consumer business . Spinning off the business, which includes consumer health and audio products, would be a step in the right direction for Masimo, analyst Vik Chopra said in a note to clients. Masimo acquired audio products maker Sound United LLC in 2022 for $1 billion. ""Investors have never come around to the Sound United deal, and we believe a separation will allow MASI to focus on its core HC business. As such, we see potential for multiple expansion over time for MASI as mgmt works through strategic options,"" Chopra said.

The firm initiated coverage of the telecommunications company at outperform with a $400 per share price target, or more than 14% upside from Friday's $348.56 close.

""MSI is a unique asset that is well-positioned to sustain high single digit topline growth and mid-teens EPS growth over the next several years and do so with limited volatility and high consistency,"" Daryanani added. — Brian Evans 7:45 a.m.: Evercore becomes bullish on Foot Locker The difficult days may finally be behind Foot Locker , according to Evercore. Analyst Michael Binetti upgraded shares to outperform from in line. He also raised his price target on shares to $32 from $28, implying 31% upside from Friday's close. The stock has struggled in the past 12 months as the shoe retailer's brand relaunch and real estate reorganization, known as the ""Lace Up"" plan, struggled to gain traction. Shares are down more than 20% in 2024 alone and more than 30% over the last 12 months.

""EV sales growth is decelerating and much needed lower-cost models are now expected late 2025-26E. We believe EV OEMs face a ""Catch-22"" juggling profitability and production ramps."" Citing challenges of moderating growth, increasing China competition and higher inventory, Rakesh lowered his price target on Tesla to $195, which implies shares could gain just 2.4%. Already, the stock has fallen more than 31% this year. His $12 price target on Rivian and $5.50 target on Nio suggests each stock could gain more than 11%, meanwhile. Rivian shares are down nearly 54% since the start of the year, while Nio is down 46%. The analyst raised his price target on buy-rated General Motors, on the other hand, favoring its measured EV rollout strategy. — Pia Singh 6:28 a.m.: Raymond James downgrades lawn products maker Scotts Miracle-Gro Scotts Miracle-Gro appears to have limited near-term upside, according to Raymond James. Analyst Joseph Altobello downgraded shares to market perform from strong buy, saying the recent rally has pushed it into ""fair value territory."" He also removed his $70 price target on the company, which sells branded consumer lawn and garden products. Shares have jumped 15% this year, outperforming the broader market. According to Altobello, these gains have been driven by the company's positive quarterly results and optimism on the regulatory and legal fronts with the cannabis industry, which would benefit the company's Hawthorne hydroponics segment. It's also a highly-levered company that has benefitted from overall market strength, helped by the Federal Reserve's positive commentary last week about the rate-cutting timeline, the analyst added. The stock is likely pricing in a ""plausible fiscal year 2026 scenario,"" Altobello said, adding that ""investors are clearly not valuing SMG on FY24 or even FY25 numbers, as the company appears to be in the midst of a significant multi-year margin expansion opportunity."" — Pia Singh 5:51 a.m.: JPMorgan initiates coverage of Super Micro, citing its AI compute market dominance As the AI compute industry grows, so should Super Micro Computer , according to JPMorgan's Samik Chatterjee. The analyst initiated coverage of the stock with an overweight rating and year-end price target of $1,150, which implies shares could jump 18.2%. ""Super Micro is the leading company in the AI compute market, which is burgeoning with demand stemming from training AI models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation by Tier 2 CSPs and Enterprises, and eventually AI inferencing workloads,"" Chatterjee wrote in a Monday note. ""We expect the leadership to continue, led by a balance of custom built solutions and fast time to market, although potential upside is more likely from rapid expansion in the AI Server market rather than expansion of the already premium valuation multiple,"" he added, saying the ""compute revolution"" is still in its early stages of demand and investments. The AI server market should expand from $41 billion in 2023 to $283 billion in 2028, he said. Shares of Super Micro — which makes servers, storage systems and other solutions related to data centers and cloud computing — have already soared 242.2% this year, fueled by the AI craze. — Pia Singh 5:37 a.m.: Barclays upgrades Disney to overweight, says shares could pop more than 16% Disney shares still have room to run even after significantly outperforming the broader market this year, according to Barclays. Analyst Kannan Venkateshwar upgraded shares of the media giant to overweight from equal weight and also raised his price target by $40. His new $135 price target implies 16.5% potential upside over the next year. ""The recent narrative reset is likely to be followed by positive estimate revisions, which is still early in the cycle and should further support valuation,"" Venkateshwar wrote in a note.

Security camera footage showing work being done on a Boeing Max 9 door plug that later blew out mid-air has been overwritten, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board said.

In a letter to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation that is reviewing the incident and Boeing's role in it, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said her agency still lacks critical information about the chain of events that led up to the January incident that caused an Alaska Airlines flight carrying 177 people to make an emergency landing.

""We still do not know who performed the work to open, reinstall, and close the door plug on the accident aircraft,"" Homendy wrote. ""Boeing has informed us that they are unable to find the records documenting this work.""

She continued: ""A verbal request was made by our investigators for security camera footage to help obtain this information; however, they were informed the footage was overwritten. The absence of those records will complicate the NTSB's investigation moving forward.""

Homendy said in the letter that she also personally called Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun and asked him for the names of the workers who performed the work in question. But, Homendy said, Calhoun stated he was ""unable to provide that information and maintained that Boeing has no records of the work being performed.""

A Boeing spokesperson said the company, like many others, does not retain security footage for longer than 30 days. The Alaska Airlines plane in question was in the factory last year in September and delivered in October.

""We will continue supporting this investigation in the transparent and proactive fashion we have supported all regulatory inquiries into this accident,"" Boeing said. ""We have worked hard to honor the rules about the release of investigative information in an environment of intense interest from our employees, customers, and other stakeholders, and we will continue our efforts to do so.""

Homendy had previously publicly reprimanded Boeing for failing to turn over information her agency had requested, calling it ""absurd.""

Last week, NBC News confirmed a Wall Street Journal report that the U.S. Department of Justice had opened a criminal case into the incident.

On Monday, South Carolina officials confirmed a Boeing whistleblower was found dead of an apparent self-inflected gunshot wound. The former employee, John Barnett, 62, was preparing to testify in a deposition in a federal legal action against Boeing dating back to at least 2017.Barnett's family in a statement that he had encountered ""a culture of concealment"" that valued ""profits over safety"" at Boeing.

The New York Times also reported this week that an FAA audit of Boeing's 737 Max production reportedly found ""dozens of issues.""

This week, major carriers that fly Boeing fuselages including Alaska Airlines, Southwest, and United Airlines said they may have to trim capacity and push back orders as a result of Boeing's issues.

The acting head of Europe's aviation regulator said on Wednesday the agency would halt its indirect approval of Boeing's jet production if warranted, but he feels reassured that the plane maker is tackling its latest safety crisis.

In an interview with Reuters, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency's, or EASA, acting executive director, Luc Tytgat, gave the first public indication that international cooperation underpinning global airplane production was being tested by the ongoing crisis as it rarely has been.

Asked if EASA would be prepared to stop recognizing U.S. production safety approvals declaring that Boeing jets are built safely, Tytgat said, ""If need be, yes.""

Boeing has been under mounting pressure over factory quality control since Jan. 5, when a door plug tore off a 737 MAX 9 jet in mid-air in an incident blamed on missing bolts.

So far this year, Boeing has handed over 54 planes, while Airbus has widened its lead over its main rival, delivering 79 planes in the first two months of 2024.

Delayed Boeing planes have been difficult for airline leaders. Southwest Airlines , which flies only Boeing 737s, on Tuesday said that it would trim capacity plans this year because of fewer Boeing Max deliveries and that it will have to reevaluate its 2024 financial estimates. United Airlines earlier this year said it was taking the 737 Max 10, which hasn't yet been certified, out of its fleet plans.

Boeing's February deliveries included 17 Max jetliners and seven wide-body 787-9 Dreamliners. Deliveries are important to manufacturers because customers pay the bulk of the aircraft's price when they receive the plane.

Boeing logged 15 gross orders for new planes in February, while Airbus sold just two. And customers aren't abandoning Boeing because of its recent struggles.

Barnett, known as Mitch to his family and ""Swampy"" to his friends, had worked at Boeing's 787 plant in Charleston, South Carolina, since 2010, his family said.

In a statement Monday, ​Boeing said: ​​""We are saddened by Mr. Barnett's passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends."" NBC News has asked Boeing for comment on the allegations in the Barnett family's statement.

The statement from Barnett's family said he had suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety attacks and that the ""hostile work environment at Boeing"" led to his death.

Charleston County Coroner Bobbi Jo O'Neal said in a statement Monday that Barnett died ""from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound,"" in the South Carolina city on Saturday.

His family said in a statement Monday that he had tried to highlight serious concerns but was met with ""a culture of concealment"" that valued ""profits over safety.""

John Barnett, 62, spent more than three decades at the aircraft manufacturing giant and sounded the alarm with aviation authorities in 2017 over what he said were potentially ""catastrophic"" safety failings.

A former Boeing quality inspector who filed a whistleblower complaint over alleged plane safety flaws was found dead ""from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound,"" officials in Charleston, South Carolina, said Monday.

In 2019, The New York Times interviewed several former Boeing employees about their safety concerns. Barnett told the paper that metal shavings — created when metal fasteners are screwed into nuts — could potentially cut wiring that connects the flight controls.

The FAA ordered Boeing to clear the shavings from the Dreamliners in 2017. Boeing said then that it was following the ruling and would look to improve the design of the nut, but also said it wasn't a flight safety issue.

But Barnett told The Times: ""I haven't seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I'd put my name on saying it's safe and airworthy.""

After his retirement in 2017, Barnett filed a whistleblower complaint to federal regulators about his experiences at the South Carolina plant. He also launched a separate legal action against Boeing, accusing the company of denigrating his character and hampering his career. Boeing denied the allegations.

His case was up for trial this June, the family statement said, adding: ""He was looking forward to having his day in court and hoped that it would force Boeing to change its culture.""

While Barnett loved his work for most of his career, in Charleston ""he learned that upper management was pressuring the quality inspectors and managers to cut corners"" and not to follow legally-required safety processes, the statement said.

He alleged that staff were pressured not to document defects because it would slow down the assembly line, it added.

""John told us that every day was a battle to get management to do the right thing,"" the family said. The statement added that Barnett and others who highlighted problems were labeled as ""trouble-makers,"" whereas previously the company had rewarded those who discovered defects.

""It caused John so much stress that his doctor told him that if he stayed, he would have a heart attack,"" the family said.

""Mitch was fun-loving, and totally devoted to family, especially his nieces and nephews and great nieces and nephews,"" an obituary shared by the family said.

It added that he is survived by his mother, Vicky Melder Stokes; brothers, Mike Barnett, Robbie Barnett, and Rodney Barnett; eight nieces and nephews and 11 great-nieces and nephews.

The news comes as Boeing faces regulatory and public scrutiny over a series of incidents involving its planes.

A Justice Department investigation has been opened after a door plug blew out on an Alaska Airlines flight in January which led to the temporary grounding of some Boeing 737 Max 9 airplanes, although they have since returned to the air.

And on Monday, 50 people were injured on a Boeing Dreamliner plane after a sudden movement mid-air, on a flight from Sydney to Auckland, New Zealand.

Qatar Airways is developing a First Class concept and pursuing aircraft orders from aviation giants Boeing and Airbus, as part of a broader strategic overhaul under new group CEO Badr Mohammed Al Meer. ""This is a new era,"" Al Meer told CNBC on Thursday, unveiling changes at the airline that follow a multi-month ""war room"" review. Formerly the chief operating officer of Qatar's Hamad International Airport, Al Meer took over from long-time predecessor Akbar Al Baker as Qatar Airways CEO in November and seeks to refresh the airline's strategy and reset supplier relationships. Al Meer confirmed to CNBC that Qatar Airways is now developing a high-yielding First Class concept for its cabins. ""We wanted to combine the experience of flying commercial and flying on a private jet and develop something new,"" he said. ""We are 70% to 80% ready. We are only finalizing colors and small touches, but hopefully we will be able to announce it very soon."" First Class seating typically offers a more spacious, premium quality and higher cost experience aboard an aircraft. Some airlines have abandoned, reduced or rebranded First Class seats in a bid to maximize aircraft space and offer more economic seating for budget-conscious travelers. Along with preparing its First Class proposal, Qatar Airways is redesigning its premium ""Q-Suite"" class of seats, and the latest offering is set to debut at the Farnborough International Airshow in July.

New orders

The Gulf carrier has also submitted a Request for Proposal to Boeing and Airbus for a ""big"" new aircraft order, Al Meer said. ""We released an RFP to create some competition between both suppliers,"" he noted, without disclosing specifics. ""We will go through the process, and, with an order this big, we need to take our time."" Al Meer wants to enhance the service offering and capitalize on momentum following the Qatar World Cup, which helped the airline deliver a record net profit of $1.21 billion in the fiscal year 2022-23, as well as the highest yields and load factors in its history. ""The markets that we want to grow in are China, India, Australia, Japan, Korea, and a few others,"" Al Meer said. He separately flagged that regional demand for flying is high, and passenger numbers had picked up by more than 30% in the last four months, while forecasting growth is likely to ""be more settled below 10%-15%,"" for the rest of the year.

The new aircraft order proposal follows a major legal dispute between Qatar Airways and Airbus over safety concerns caused by paint degradation. It also comes amid an ongoing crisis of confidence at Boeing after the Max 9 door blowout in January raised concerns over safety, quality controls and production and delivery delays. ""We are affected when our aircrafts are not being delivered on time,"" Al Meer said. ""I know Airbus and Boeing have certain problems. We have full trust in both organizations and they're strong enough to overcome those problems."" Al Meer noted he expects to receive Qatar's latest Boeing 777X order by the end of next year, adding he's ""110% confident"" Boeing makes safe planes.

Al Meer also said Qatar Airways would halt Al Baker's plans for a fast ""phase-out"" of the flagship Airbus A380. Rival Emirates also signaled it would hold onto the airliner, despite Airbus ending its production in 2021.

For me, a weekly scan for stocks making new three-month highs and lows has become a vital part of my own toolkit, as it helps me identify new leadership themes a little earlier on in the trend. I was surprised this week to note the large number of health-care names represented on the new highs list. And it wasn't just one group or theme within the sector, but rather a broader advance including biotech, medical supplies, medical equipment, and even pharmaceuticals. Here are three stocks in the health-care sector that could provide further upside potential based on their improving technical characteristics. 1. Boston Scientific (BSX) BSX is demonstrating a classic ""big base breakout"" pattern, having broken above price resistance around $55 in November 2023. This level was first reached in May 2023, after an 11-month rally from a June 2022 low around $35. But since first reaching that level in May of last year, the chart has been decidedly sideways, representing an equilibrium between buyers and sellers. That all changed in November, when BSX finally broke above this well-established resistance level, pushing into the upper $50s this month. Using the height of the basing pattern projects a minimum upside target around $52, but upside potential could be much greater given the strong momentum characteristics. 2. Stryker Corp. (SYK) Stryker is another stock in the medical equipment group and looks very much like BSX before the recent price breakout. Here we see the April 2023 high lines up well with highs in June, July, and September of this year. Just this week, we're seeing SYK threaten a new 52-week high, which would propel the stock above its previous resistance and confirm another big base breakout. The height of the recent basing pattern suggests an upside target around $372, which would mean another 22% above current levels. And as long as SYK can remain above the recent breakout level around $300-305, the chart will remain in a bullish configuration. 3. Amgen, Inc. (AMGN) While the broader biotechnology group was in a well-defined downtrend into the October 2022 market low, Amgen actually bottomed in June before finishing 2023 in a position of strength. Recent price action has pushed AMGN to a new swing high, completing a classic ""cup and handle"" pattern. From November 2022 to June 2023, AMGN dropped from around $295 to $215, shedding about 27% of its value in just seven months. But since June of last year, the stock has been in a fairly consistent uptrend of higher highs and higher lows, leading to a retest of the late 2022 high in October 2023. A cup and handle pattern has a broad bottoming pattern (the ""cup"") followed by a shallower pullback (the ""handle"") which leads the price back up to a major resistance level. Once AMGN was able to push above $295, that completed the pattern and confirmed a new bullish trend for the stock. With any breakouts like this one, it's important to watch the previous resistance level which often serves as price support going forward. As long as AMGN remains above $290, we see this as a strong chart getting stronger. -David Keller https://www.marketmisbehavior.com DISCLOSURES: (None) THE ABOVE CONTENT IS SUBJECT TO OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND PRIVACY POLICY .

Here's how big of a surprise corporate profits have been this earnings season: The fourth quarter is now shaping up to be the best of 2023.

Despite ongoing macroeconomic concerns that have hampered demand and weighed on consumer sentiment, almost halfway into earnings season, profits are clearly coming in far better than anybody expected.

Helping companies' bottom lines this round: easing input costs, more emphasis on cost controls and efficiencies and significantly reduced expectations.

A plethora of significant earnings beats among some very important S&P 500 companies such as Amazon , Meta , Apple , Chevron , ExxonMobil , Merck and Bristol Myers Squibb have moved the Q4 growth rate notably higher late this week.

LSEG, formerly Refinitiv, is now seeing a nearly 8% rise in earnings growth this season. That's far better than the 4.7% expected just three weeks ago, right before the big banks reported results.

Stronger-than-expected results from three sectors are particularly notable:

Energy – 90% of the companies have beat earnings estimates, with profits coming in almost 14% above expectations.

– 90% of the companies have beat earnings estimates, with profits coming in almost 14% above expectations. Health care – 85% have beat on the bottom line, with earnings coming in nearly 11% above expectations.

– 85% have beat on the bottom line, with earnings coming in nearly 11% above expectations. Tech – 84% have posted earnings beats, with earnings more than 5% above expectations.

As for the S&P 500 as a whole, Q4's current earnings per share growth rate of 7.8% exceeds the 7.5% growth seen in all of Q3 — and is now tops for the year.",2/2/2024,0,0.003851569,0.987035215,0.000683399,0.00395551,0.00339487,0.001079485

Deckers Outdoor — Shares of the maker of the Ugg and Teva footwear brands surged 14.1% after the company's fiscal third-quarter results exceeded Wall Street estimates, and it announced a new CEO.

Chevron — Shares jumped nearly 3% after the nation's second-largest oil company raised its dividend by 8%. Chevron posted mixed fourth-quarter results, with adjusted earnings per share of $3.45 topping the $3.21 expected by analysts polled by LSEG.

Intel — The chipmaker fell 1.7% after The Wall Street Journal reported that Intel is delaying construction of its $20 billion chip factory in Ohio due to market challenges. Microchip Technology — The semiconductor stock slid more than 1% after the company issued a weak outlook for its fiscal fourth quarter ending March 31.

99,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/11/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-says-committed-to-cost-cutting-while-investing-in-ai-in-shareholder-letter.html,BR,Broadridge Financial Solutions,Amazon CEO Andy Jassy in shareholder letter says he's committed to cost cutting while investing in AI,"Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on Thursday published his annual shareholder letter, where he pledged to look for ways to keep costs in check even as the company doubles down on investing in new growth areas like artificial intelligence.

""I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one of our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers' lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we're investing,"" Jassy wrote in his third shareholder letter since taking the helm at Amazon from former CEO Jeff Bezos, who stepped down in mid-2021.

Under Jassy, Amazon has morphed into a leaner version of itself, as slowing sales and a challenging economy pushed the company to eschew the relentless growth of the Bezos years. Beginning at the end of 2022 and continuing through 2023, Amazon initiated the largest layoffs in its history, cutting more than 27,000 jobs. Those cuts have continued this year, with Amazon announcing layoffs in its cloud computing, Prime Video and Twitch livestreaming units, among others.

Jassy said he believes there's ways for the company to continue ""lowering our cost to serve"" in the retail business this year and beyond that.

Even amid a period of retrenchment in some areas, Jassy said he's focused on finding new areas of growth within the company so that Amazon remains ""resilient"" in the long term. He stressed the importance of building ""primitive services,"" which he described as ""discrete, foundational building blocks"" that can spur new projects and businesses.

Jassy used Amazon Web Services, its cloud computing division, as an example. Before he became Amazon's CEO, Jassy oversaw the creation of AWS, which grew from an internal tool powering its retail operations to become the dominant cloud service and one of Amazon's most profitable businesses.

He said he believes generative artificial intelligence is shaping up to become Amazon's next big primitive service. The company has been in search of its next ""pillar,"" which is an internal phrase the company often uses to describe its most successful businesses. Amazon's first three pillars are its retail, Prime subscription and cloud computing units.

""While we're building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the vast majority will ultimately be built by other companies,"" Jassy said. ""However, what we're building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundation model.""

He noted Amazon's cloud computing service will be an important player in the AI boom, saying, ""We're optimistic that much of this world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.""

Amazon on Thursday added Andrew Ng, a renowned AI pioneer who previously led Google Brain and was a scientist at Baidu, to its board. Ng will succeed Judy McGrath, who has sat on the board since 2014.

In the past year, Amazon has made a flurry of AI announcements as the field exploded, causing tech companies to pour money into the space. Last month, Amazon added $2.75 billion to its stake in AI startup Anthropic in its largest venture investment yet. Jassy has also pledged to infuse AI into every one of Amazon's businesses.

The company in February launched a tool called Rufus that uses AI to help users search and shop for products. Elsewhere, it has rolled out ""Q,"" an AI chatbot for companies to assist with daily tasks, and Bedrock, a generative AI service for Amazon Web Services customers.

Here's the full text of Jassy's letter:

Dear Shareholders:

Last year at this time, I shared my enthusiasm and optimism for Amazon's future. Today, I have even more. The reasons are many, but start with the progress we've made in our financial results and customer experiences, and extend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front of us.

In 2023, Amazon's total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (""YoY"") from $514B to $575B. By segment, North America revenue increased 12% YoY from $316B to $353B, International revenue grew 11% YoY from $118B to $131B, and AWS revenue increased 13% YoY from $80B to $91B.

Further, Amazon's operating income and Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") dramatically improved. Operating income in 2023 improved 201% YoY from $12.2B (an operating margin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operating margin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8B in 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B).

While we've made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we're most pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across our businesses.

In our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our relentless focus on selection, price, and convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection, with hundreds of millions of products available, tens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to list on Amazon (e.g. Coach, Victoria's Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart, Clinique, Lancôme, and Urban Decay).

Being sharp on price is always important, but particularly in an uncertain economy, where customers are careful about how much they're spending. As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. This was followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers, that became our largest revenue event ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions of deals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year.

We also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company records. In 2023, Amazon delivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is the combination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network to store items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increased the number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% YoY. As we get items to customers this fast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results in various areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing (over 20% YoY in Q4 2023).

Our regionalization efforts have also trimmed transportation distances, helping lower our cost to serve. In 2023, for the first time since 2018, we reduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S. alone, cost to serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit YoY. Decreasing cost to serve allows us both to invest in speed improvements and afford adding more selection at lower Average Selling Prices (""ASPs""). More selection at lower prices puts us in consideration for more purchases.

As we look toward 2024 (and beyond), we're not done lowering our cost to serve. We've challenged every closely held belief in our fulfillment network, and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where we believe we can lower costs even further while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillment architecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there's more upside for us.

Internationally, we like the trajectory of our established countries, and see meaningful progress in our emerging geographies (e.g. India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, Middle East, Africa, etc.) as they continue to expand selection and features, and move toward profitability (in Q4 2023, Mexico became our latest international Stores locale to turn profitable). We have high conviction that these new geographies will continue to grow and be profitable in the long run.

Alongside our Stores business, Amazon's Advertising progress remains strong, growing 24% YoY from $38B in 2022 to $47B in 2023, primarily driven by our sponsored ads. We've added Sponsored TV to this offering, a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streaming TV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch, and have no minimum spend. Recently, we've expanded our streaming TV advertising by introducing ads into Prime Video shows and movies, where brands can reach over 200 million monthly viewers in our most popular entertainment offerings, across hit movies and shows, award-winning Amazon MGM Originals, and live sports like Thursday Night Football. Streaming TV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start.

Shifting to AWS, we started 2023 seeing substantial cost optimization, with most companies trying to save money in an uncertain economy. Much of this optimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the cloud more efficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like Graviton chips (our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-performance than other leading x86 processors), S3 Intelligent Tiering (a storage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and store them in less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give customers lower prices in exchange for longer commitments). This work diminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated, and should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimization attenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, and migrations growing again.

The past year was also a significant delivery year for AWS. We announced our next generation of generalized CPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30% better compute performance and 75% more memory bandwidth than its already-leading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips, which will deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative AI applications and three times more memory capacity than Trainium1. We continued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint, now offering 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions coming (Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and a second German region in Berlin). In Generative AI (""GenAI""), we added dozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easier for developers to build new Foundation Models (""FMs""). We invented and delivered a new service (Amazon Bedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI applications. And, we launched the most capable coding assistant around in Amazon Q. Customers are excited about these capabilities, and we're seeing significant traction in our GenAI offerings. (More on how we're approaching GenAI and why we believe we'll be successful later in the letter.)

We're also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon long-term. Touching on two of them:

We have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own. This confidence is buoyed by the continued development of compelling, exclusive content (e.g. Thursday Night Football, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, The Boys, Citadel, Road House, etc.), Prime Video customers' engagement with this content, growth in our marketplace programs (through our third-party Channels program, as well as the broad selection of shows and movies customers rent or buy), and the addition of advertising in Prime Video.

In October, we hit a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper when we launched two end-to-end prototype satellites into space, and successfully validated all key systems and sub-systems—rare in an initial launch like this. Kuiper is our low Earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to provide broadband connectivity to the 400-500 million households who don't have it today (as well as governments and enterprises seeking better connectivity and performance in more remote areas), and is a very large revenue opportunity for Amazon. We're on track to launch our first production satellites in 2024. We've still got a long way to go, but are encouraged by our progress.

Overall, 2023 was a strong year, and I'm grateful to our collective teams who delivered on behalf of customers. These results represent a lot of invention, collaboration, discipline, execution, and reimagination across Amazon. Yet, I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one of our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers' lives better and easier, and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we're investing.

===

In my annual letter over the last three years, I've tried to give shareholders more insight into how we're thinking about the company, the businesses we're pursuing, our future opportunities, and what makes us tick. We operate in a diverse number of market segments, but what ties Amazon together is our joint mission to make customers' lives better and easier every day. This is true across every customer segment we serve (consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators). At our best, we're not just customer obsessed, but also inventive, thinking several years out, learning like crazy, scrappy, delivering quickly, and operating like the world's biggest start-up.

We spend enormous energy thinking about how to empower builders, inside and outside of our company. We characterize builders as people who like to invent. They like to dissect a customer experience, assess what's wrong with it, and reinvent it. Builders tend not to be satisfied until the customer experience is perfect. This doesn't hinder them from delivering improvements along the way, but it drives them to keep tinkering and iterating continually. While unafraid to invent from scratch, they have no hesitation about using high-quality, scalable, cost-effective components from others. What matters to builders is having the right tools to keep rapidly improving customer experiences.

The best way we know how to do this is by building primitive services. Think of them as discrete, foundational building blocks that builders can weave together in whatever combination they desire. Here's how we described primitives in our 2003 AWS Vision document:

""Primitives are the raw parts or the most foundational-level building blocks for software developers. They're indivisible (if they can be functionally split into two they must) and they do one thing really well. They're meant to be used together rather than as solutions in and of themselves. And, we'll build them for maximum developer flexibility. We won't put a bunch of constraints on primitives to guard against developers hurting themselves. Rather, we'll optimize for developer freedom and innovation.""

Of course, this concept of primitives can be applied to more than software development, but they're especially relevant in technology. And, over the last 20 years, primitives have been at the heart of how we've innovated quickly.

One of the many advantages to thinking in primitives is speed. Let me give you two counter examples that illustrate this point. First, we built a successful owned-inventory retail business in the early years at Amazon where we bought all our products from publishers, manufacturers, and distributors, stored them in our warehouses, and shipped them ourselves. Over time, we realized we could add broader selection and lower prices by allowing third-party sellers to list their offerings next to our own on our highly trafficked search and product detail pages. We'd built several core retail services (e.g. payments, search, ordering, browse, item management) that made trying different marketplace concepts simpler than if we didn't have those components. A good set of primitives? Not really.

It turns out that these core components were too jumbled together and not partitioned right. We learned this the hard way when we partnered with companies like Target in our Merchant.com business in the early 2000s. The concept was that target.com would use Amazon's ecommerce components as the backbone of its website, and then customize however they wished. To enable this arrangement, we had to deliver those components as separable capabilities through application programming interfaces (""APIs""). This decoupling was far more difficult than anticipated because we'd built so many dependencies between these services as Amazon grew so quickly the first few years.

This coupling was further highlighted by a heavyweight mechanism we used to operate called ""NPI."" Any new initiative requiring work from multiple internal teams had to be reviewed by this NPI cabal where each team would communicate how many people-weeks their work would take. This bottleneck constrained what we accomplished, frustrated the heck out of us, and inspired us to eradicate it by refactoring these ecommerce components into true primitive services with well-documented, stable APIs that enabled our builders to use each other's services without any coordination tax.

In the middle of the Target and NPI challenges, we were contemplating building a new set of infrastructure technology services that would allow both Amazon to move more quickly and external developers to build anything they imagined. This set of services became known as AWS, and the above experiences convinced us that we should build a set of primitive services that could be composed together how anybody saw fit. At that time, most technology offerings were very feature-rich, and tried to solve multiple jobs simultaneously. As a result, they often didn't do any one job that well.

Our AWS primitive services were designed from the start to be different. They offered important, highly flexible, but focused functionality. For instance, our first major primitive was Amazon Simple Storage Service (""S3"") in March 2006 that aimed to provide highly secure object storage, at very high durability and availability, at Internet scale, and very low cost. In other words, be stellar at object storage. When we launched S3, developers were excited, and a bit mystified. It was a very useful primitive service, but they wondered, why just object storage? When we launched Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (""EC2"") in August 2006 and Amazon SimpleDB in 2007, people realized we were building a set of primitive infrastructure services that would allow them to build anything they could imagine, much faster, more cost-effectively, and without having to manage or lay out capital upfront for the datacenter or hardware. As AWS unveiled these building blocks over time (we now have over 240 at builders' disposal—meaningfully more than any other provider), whole companies sprang up quickly on top of AWS (e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, Stripe, etc.), industries reinvented themselves on AWS (e.g. streaming with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Fox, Paramount), and even critical government agencies switched to AWS (e.g. CIA, along with several other U.S. Intelligence agencies). But, one of the lesser-recognized beneficiaries was Amazon's own consumer businesses, which innovated at dramatic speed across retail, advertising, devices (e.g. Alexa and FireTV), Prime Video and Music, Amazon Go, Drones, and many other endeavors by leveraging the speed with which AWS let them build. Primitives, done well, rapidly accelerate builders' ability to innovate.

So, how do you build the right set of primitives?

Pursuing primitives is not a guarantee of success. There are many you could build, and even more ways to combine them. But, a good compass is to pick real customer problems you're trying to solve.

Our logistics primitives are an instructive example. In Amazon's early years, we built core capabilities around warehousing items, and then picking, packing, and shipping them quickly and reliably to customers. As we added third-party sellers to our marketplace, they frequently requested being able to use these same logistics capabilities. Because we'd built this initial set of logistics primitives, we were able to introduce Fulfillment by Amazon (""FBA"") in 2006, allowing sellers to use Amazon's Fulfillment Network to store items, and then have us pick, pack, and ship them to customers, with the bonus of these products being available for fast, Prime delivery. This service has saved sellers substantial time and money (typically about 70% less expensive than doing themselves), and remains one of our most popular services. As more merchants began to operate their own direct-to-consumer (""DTC"") websites, many yearned to still use our fulfillment capabilities, while also accessing our payments and identity primitives to drive higher order conversion on their own websites (as Prime members have already shared this payment and identity information with Amazon). A couple years ago, we launched Buy with Prime to address this customer need. Prime members can check out quickly on DTC websites like they do on Amazon, and receive fast Prime shipping speeds on Buy with Prime items—increasing order conversion for merchants by ~25% vs. their default experience.

As our Stores business has grown substantially, and our supply chain become more complex, we've had to develop a slew of capabilities in order to offer customers unmatched selection, at low prices, and with very fast delivery times. We've become adept at getting products from other countries to the U.S., clearing customs, and then shipping to storage facilities. Because we don't have enough space in our shipping fulfillment centers to store all the inventory needed to maintain our desired in-stock levels, we've built a set of lower-cost, upstream warehouses solely optimized for storage (without sophisticated end-user, pick, pack, and ship functions). Having these two pools of inventory has prompted us to build algorithms predicting when we'll run out of inventory in our shipping fulfillment centers and automatically replenishing from these upstream warehouses. And, in the last few years, our scale and available alternatives have forced us to build our own last mile delivery capability (roughly the size of UPS) to affordably serve the number of consumers and sellers wanting to use Amazon.

We've solved these customer needs by building additional fulfillment primitives that both serve Amazon consumers better and address external sellers' increasingly complex ecommerce activities. For instance, for sellers needing help importing products, we offer a Global Mile service that leverages our expertise here. To ship inventory from the border (or anywhere domestically) to our storage facilities, we enable sellers to use either our first-party Amazon Freight service or third-party freight partners via our Partnered Carrier Program. To store more inventory at lower cost to ensure higher in-stock rates and shorter delivery times, we've opened our upstream Amazon Warehousing and Distribution facilities to sellers (along with automated replenishment to our shipping fulfillment centers when needed). For those wanting to manage their own shipping, we've started allowing customers to use our last mile delivery network to deliver packages to their end-customers in a service called Amazon Shipping. And, for sellers who wish to use our fulfillment network as a central place to store inventory and ship items to customers regardless of where they ordered, we have a Multi-Channel Fulfillment service. These are all primitives that we've exposed to sellers.

Building in primitives meaningfully expands your degrees of freedom. You can keep your primitives to yourself and build compelling features and capabilities on top of them to allow your customers and business to reap the benefits of rapid innovation. You can offer primitives to external customers as paid services (as we have with AWS and our more recent logistics offerings). Or, you can compose these primitives into external, paid applications as we have with FBA, Buy with Prime, or Supply Chain by Amazon (a recently released logistics service that integrates several of our logistics primitives). But, you've got options. You're only constrained by the primitives you've built and your imagination.

Take the new, same-day fulfillment facilities in our Stores business. They're located in the largest metro areas around the U.S. (we currently have 58), house our top-moving 100,000 SKUs (but also cover millions of other SKUs that can be injected from nearby fulfillment centers into these same-day facilities), and streamline the time required to go from picking a customer's order to being ready to ship to as little as 11 minutes. These facilities also constitute our lowest cost to serve in the network. The experience has been so positive for customers that we're planning to double the number of these facilities.

But, how else might we use this capability if we think of it as a core building block? We have a very large and growing grocery business in organic grocery (with Whole Foods Market) and non-perishable goods (e.g. consumables, canned goods, health and beauty products, etc.). We've been working hard on building a mass, physical store offering (Amazon Fresh) that offers a great perishable experience; however, what if we used our same-day facilities to enable customers to easily add milk, eggs, or other perishable items to any Amazon order and get same day? It might change how people think of splitting up their weekly grocery shopping, and make perishable shopping as convenient as non-perishable shopping already is.

Or, take a service that some people have questioned, but that's making substantial progress and we think of as a very valuable future primitive capability—our delivery drones (called Prime Air). Drones will eventually allow us to deliver packages to customers in less than an hour. It won't start off being available for all sizes of packages and in all locations, but we believe it'll be pervasive over time. Think about how the experience of ordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?

The same is true for Amazon Pharmacy. Need throat lozenges, Advil, an antibiotic, or some other medication? Same-day facilities already deliver many of these items within hours, and that will only get shorter as we launch Prime Air more expansively. Highly flexible building blocks can be composed across businesses and in new combinations that change what's possible for customers.

Being intentional about building primitives requires patience. Releasing the first couple primitive services can sometimes feel random to customers (or the public at large) before we've unveiled how these building blocks come together. I've mentioned AWS and S3 as an example, but our Health offering is another. In the last 10 years, we've tried several Health experiments across various teams—but they were not driven by our primitives approach. This changed in 2022 when we applied our primitives thinking to the enormous global healthcare problem and opportunity. We've now created several important building blocks to help transform the customer health experience: Acute Care (via Amazon Clinic), Primary Care (via One Medical), and a Pharmacy service to buy whatever medication a patient may need. Because of our growing success, Amazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and nutrition opportunities—which can be partially unlocked with some of our existing grocery building blocks, including Whole Foods Market or Amazon Fresh.

As a builder, it's hard to wait for these building blocks to be built versus just combining a bunch of components together to solve a specific problem. The latter can be faster, but almost always slows you down in the future. We've seen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There are dozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity, and cost. Some of the biggest opportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobility of large cages across long distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip right to the complex solution, baking in ""just enough"" of these disciplines to make a concerted solution work, but which doesn't solve much more, can't easily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can't be reused for other initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think in primitives, like our Robotics team does, you prioritize the building blocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit from each of these primitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and quickly) for future and complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will be lynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading, large pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles). The team is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments, optimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the bottlenecks in our facilities.

Sometimes, people ask us ""what's your next pillar? You have Marketplace, Prime, and AWS, what's next?"" This, of course, is a thought-provoking question. However, a question people never ask, and might be even more interesting is what's the next set of primitives you're building that enables breakthrough customer experiences? If you asked me today, I'd lead with Generative AI (""GenAI"").

Much of the early public attention has focused on GenAI applications, with the remarkable 2022 launch of ChatGPT. But, to our ""primitive"" way of thinking, there are three distinct layers in the GenAI stack, each of which is gigantic, and each of which we're deeply investing.

The bottom layer is for developers and companies wanting to build foundation models (""FMs""). The primary primitives are the compute required to train models and generate inferences (or predictions), and the software that makes it easier to build these models. Starting with compute, the key is the chip inside it. To date, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia chips, and we continue to offer the broadest collection of Nvidia instances of any provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue as customers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope on price-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we've built custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, we announced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully more price-performant than their first versions and other alternatives. This past fall, leading FM-maker, Anthropic, announced it would use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future FMs. We already have several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh, and Snap.

Customers building their own FM must tackle several challenges in getting a model into production. Getting data organized and fine-tuned, building scalable and efficient training infrastructure, and then deploying models at scale in a low latency, cost-efficient manner is hard. It's why we've built Amazon SageMaker, a managed, end-to-end service that's been a game changer for developers in preparing their data for AI, managing experiments, training models faster (e.g. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster in SageMaker), lowering inference latency (e.g. Workday has reduced inference latency by 80% with SageMaker), and improving developer productivity (e.g. NatWest reduced its time-to-value for AI from 12-18 months to under seven months using SageMaker).

The middle layer is for customers seeking to leverage an existing FM, customize it with their own data, and leverage a leading cloud provider's security and features to build a GenAI application—all as a managed service. Amazon Bedrock invented this layer and provides customers with the easiest way to build and scale GenAI applications with the broadest selection of first- and third-party FMs, as well as leading ease-of-use capabilities that allow GenAI builders to get higher quality model outputs more quickly. Bedrock is off to a very strong start with tens of thousands of active customers after just a few months.

(We're no longer recording the audio, so we can get this new written feature to members as quickly as possible.) Momentum fading?: The S & P 500 is on track for slight losses Monday, but stocks are well off their lows of the session. Concerns about Friday's intraday reversal in leading artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia — which traded 5% higher before closing down 5% — extended into the new week. Many observers are arguing that some pockets of the market, mainly in the AI trade, have moved too far, too fast and are ripe for pullbacks. Nvidia, a longtime Club holding, fell 1.5% Monday. Last week, we cautioned around what we perceived as toppy behavior , contending it would be healthy for the market to shakeout some of its excess froth. Given these concerns, we would not be surprised to see more choppiness ahead and pullbacks like we're seeing Monday play out more frequently over the next few weeks. That may create better buying opportunities for those with patience and willing to pass on the ""first dip."" Sectors leading: Materials is the top-performing sector Monday. Some of that is tied to Club holding Linde , which climbed more than 1% on news it will be added to the Nasdaq 100 index later this month. However, the strength is mostly in some of the group's laggards like Albemarle , Newmont , FMC Corp . and International Flavors & Fragrances . The No. 2 performing sector Monday is consumer staples, and the move higher in the group makes sense to us. If investors are fearing momentum and selling stocks with extended, parabolic charts, it's likely some of that money will find its way into more stable names that pay solid dividends. Club consumer staple Procter & Gamble , which was upgraded to buy from hold by Truist, added about 0.7%. Energy is higher despite being weighed down by EQT Corp. 's acquisition-related decline. Sectors lagging: Meanwhile, industrials on Monday are at the bottom of the S & P 500. Some of this underperformance has to do with Boeing falling on reports of a new Department of Justice probe into the Alaska Airlines door blowout, but there's also profit-taking afoot in recent winners like housing-linked Builders FirstSource and Howmet Aerospace . Tech also is having a rough day as the recent rallies in semiconductor stocks like Nvidia and software names lose steam. Later: Earnings from tech giant Oracle will give us the latest read on the data center market and cloud spending environment. Tuesday is a busy day with earnings from shoe maker On Holding and retailer Kohl's , as well as the the February consumer price index report before the bell, which will provide the latest look at U.S. inflation.

She placed her bid on a home for 5,555 euros sight unseen and won, thus starting her on a four-year journey of renovations.

Meredith Tabbone says she's never done a renovation project like this before, but she was inspired by the work of her father, who was an architect. Mickey Todiwala | CNBC Make It

""From the moment that I sent in the bid and checked my email every day and found out that I won, all the way through this process, there have been 4 million moments of frustration, exhaustion, contemplation of how to move forward,"" she says. Tabbone and other 1-euro homebuyers share their biggest pieces of advice to other aspiring renovators around the world.

Prepare for additional costs

Sicily's homes may start at 1 euro, but the cost is largely symbolic and just the start of more expenses down the line. In Mussomeli, one of the most famous 1-euro towns, buyers must also pay a realtors fee of 500 euros and pay for the deed, which costs 2,800 euros. That adds up to a total of 3,301 euros, or nearly $3,600.

Rubia Daniels is from Berkeley, Calif., and bought several 1-euro houses in Mussomeli, Sicily. Mickey Todiwala | CNBC Make It

Rubia Daniels, 50, of Berkeley, Calif., bought three 1-euro homes in Mussomeli in 2019. So far, she's focused her efforts on renovating her main vacation home. She originally thought it would cost her $20,000 but has already spent $35,000 between materials, labor and furniture. She hopes to stay under $40,000. Tabbone paid 5,555 euros for her home, plus some taxes and fees, bringing the home sale up to 5,900 euros, or roughly $6,400. She then bought the building next door through a private sale with the owner for 22,000 euros, or nearly $24,000. Over the next four years, Tabbone spent about 425,000 euros on renovations, or roughly $463,000. Altogether, that adds up to 430,900 euros, or $469,500 for her dream home in Sicily.

Be present for renovations

Speaking of renovations, though communicating with local construction workers can kick off plans, buyers say it's crucial to be on the ground while work is being done. Danny McCubbin, an Australian native who bought a 1-euro house in Mussomeli, says he's seen ""quite a few"" foreigners try to manage their project from their home country. McCubbin bought his cheap Sicilian home in 2019 with hopes to turn it into a food-rescue charity. He ended up selling his house back to the real estate agency after it experienced extensive, and costly, water damage. But he managed to open his charity, The Good Kitchen, elsewhere in town. ""It's best to actually be here with the builder, choosing the tiles, choosing whatever you need,"" he says. For the times you can't be there in-person, he also recommends finding a local project manager who can speak English and Italian to communicate plans with the local crew.

Have patience

Daniels works in construction and learned quickly that things in Sicily take much longer than they do in the U.S. ""Working with contractors in Sicily, I had to learn how to set my expectations, but not my American expectations,"" she says. Have patience to understand the culture and how business is done so you don't get frustrated, she adds. She's been renovating her main home in Mussomeli on and off since 2020 and is still several months from finishing. ""Overall, there's plenty capable people to do the work,"" Daniels says, but ""the work here, it flows in a different way. You have to remember this is an island and they are in an island time. So [things] just move a little bit slower than what you expect.""

Visit in the winter

If you're planning to buy real estate in another country, it's best to spend a good amount of time there. And don't only go when it's peak travel season. ""I always say come for longer than one or two weeks,"" McCubbin says. ""And most importantly, come in winter. In summertime it's beautiful. It's sunny, the houses, there's no mold in them. You discover in winter that a lot of these houses do have mold. They do have moisture, and it's a very different feel here than in summer.""

Learn the language

Tabbone, Daniels and McCubbin agree that it's crucial to learn Italian in order to really get around Sicily, especially if you plan to spend part of your year there. Language-learning apps and courses are a good place to start, but immersing yourself among locals is another great way to practice. Tabbone says she enjoys spending time with Sicilians when she visits. Her first friends in Sambuca included members of the construction crew on her project, who then introduced her to their friends and family members. She also has a close relationship with the town's mayor — she practices her Italian with him and he practices his English with her. ""I think I would be extremely fluent in Italian if Google Translate did not exist,"" she jokes, ""but I'm very, very proficient at Google Translate.""

They may fluctuate as the Fed rate changes. CNBC Select will update as changes are made public. Cash App earned its reputation as a top money transfer app, but it has added more traditional banking features, including a high-yield savings account (HYSA) and VISA-branded debit card, as well as giving users the ability to invest in stocks and buy and sell bitcoin. CNBC Select looks at Cash App's banking features and sees how they stack up to the competition.

How Cash App Banking works

There are no fees to download Cash App or access its basic services. Users can open an account without a bank account or credit check and there are no minimum balance requirements after the $1 opening deposit (unless you want the 4.50% APY). You can add money to your balance via direct deposit or by depositing cash at participating retailers like Walmart, Walgreens, 7-Eleven and Family Dollar. Similar to a traditional checking account, you can use your account and routing numbers to pay bills online and withdraw money from ATMs with your Cash App Card. Because Cash App is a financial services platform and not a bank, deposits are FDIC-insured through Wells Fargo Bank for up to $250,000 per person.

Cash App Banking APY

To open a Cash App savings account and earn their APY, you must be 18 or older and have a Cash App personal account and a Cash App Card. There are no monthly fees or balance requirements. One of Cash App's biggest draws is that savers can earn up to 4.50% APY, a return on par with some of the best high-yield savings accounts. To unlock that higher APY, though, you'll have to set up a monthly direct deposit of at least $300.



Otherwise, the savings account earns a base 1.50% APY. If you're already using Cash App for payment transfers or ATM access, the savings account is the icing on the cake. If you just want a high yield and aren't looking for other features, these are HYSAs with APYs above 5.00% and no monthly deposit requirements.

Cash App Banking features

Cash App has expanded beyond just payment transfers to offer a suite of banking features. Savings account The standard Cash App Savings APY is 1.50% after you receive a card. You can unlock an additional 3% (for a total APY of 4.50%) by setting up a direct deposit of $300 or more in paychecks every month. You can round up Cash App Card purchases to the nearest dollar and deposit the difference to your savings account. You can also set savings goals and assign an emoji to the objective you've selected. Cash App users who sign up for direct deposit can get their paycheck up to two days early and have Cash App's ATM fees waived. You can't withdraw cash directly from your Cash App savings account, but you can make unlimited instant transfers between your Cash App balance and savings with no fees or monthly caps. Debit card Although Cash App is a mobile payment app, it offers the Cash App Card, a prepaid Visa debit card issued by Sutton Bank. It connects directly to your Cash App balance and doesn't come with the monthly fees or minimum balance requirements often associated with traditional checking accounts. Once you open an account with Cash App and receive your card in the mail, you can use it to pay online or in stores anywhere Visa is accepted. Cash Card users can get exclusive access to concert presales, special events and limited-edition collections. They can also select categories to earn cash back from, including purchases at restaurants, coffee shops and stores. Cardholders can only activate one offer at a time, however, and offers change regularly. ATM access The Cash App Card can be used to make withdrawals from ATMs and get cash back at checkout. Customers who direct deposit at least $300 a month get free unlimited withdrawals from in-network ATMs, as well as one free out-of-network withdrawal every month. If you don't have qualifying direct deposits (or use an out-of-network ATM), there is a $2.50 fee — plus any charge from the ATM operator. There are also limits on ATM withdrawals: $1,000 per day

$1,000 per ATM transaction

$1,000 per week

Fees

Cash App's banking features don't come with monthly fees. There are no overdraft fees and customers who direct deposit at least $300 can receive up to $50 in overdraft coverage protection.

Security features

Cash App utilizes standard security features like data encryption, security locks, identity verification and fraud detection. Users can also choose to enable Face ID.



Cash App sends notifications about suspicious activity (like a log-in in from a new device), as well as real-time transaction alerts.

Cash App Banking vs. Chime Banking

Like Cash App, Chime is a fintech company partnering with a traditional bank (Oklahoma-based Stride Bank) to offer savings and checking accounts, debit cards and credit cards.

Chime Checking + High-Yield Savings Learn More Chime ® banking services, credit and debit card provided by The Bancorp Bank, N.A. or Stride Bank, N.A., Members FDIC. Annual Percentage Yield (APY) Chime Checking 0% APY, required to enroll in Chime High-Yield Savings 2.00% APY

Minimum balance $0, no minimum deposit or balance

Fees No monthly maintenance or overdraft fees. SpotMe service with eligibility for no-fee overdraft up to $200.

Perks Paycheck available up to two days early with direct deposit. Automated savings of 10% of certain direct deposits. Round Ups feature transfers spare change from purchases to savings.

Maximum transactions Cash withdrawals from checking up to $515 per day at any ATM or as an over-the-counter bank withdrawal. $2,500 maximum daily spend, including any withdrawals, purchases and incurred fees.

ATMs 60,000+ in-network no-fee ATMs.

Mobile check deposit Yes Terms apply.

Like Cash App, Chime doesn't charge monthly fees or overdraft fees for checking and there is no minimum account balance requirement. Chime also offers a debit card with fee-free ATM access for customers who set up direct deposit. Chime's savings account has a lower 2.00% APY, but there is no direct deposit requirement to unlock the full yield. Where Chime outshines Cash App is with its credit-builder secured credit card, which doesn't require a credit check and has no minimum security deposit requirement, no annual fee and no interest. If you're focused on maximizing the return on your savings, Cash App is the stronger option. If you're building or repairing your credit, Chime might be the better choice.

FAQs Do I need a bank account to use Cash App Banking? No, you don't need a bank account to use Cash App. You can set up direct deposits or make deposits at participating retailers. Can I use an ATM to take out money from my Cash App Banking account? Cash App customers who direct deposit at least $300 a month get free unlimited withdrawals from in-network ATMs and one free out-of-network withdrawal a month. If you don't have qualifying direct deposits or use an out-of-network ATM, there is a $2.50 fee plus any charge from the ATM operator for out-of-network withdrawals. Is Cash App Banking safe? Cash App uses standard encryption and fraud detection technology to protect users' data. Deposits are FDIC-insured through Wells Fargo for up to $250,000 per person.

Compare offers to find the best savings account

Bottom line

Cash App isn't a conventional approach to banking, but it can be helpful for those who've had trouble getting a bank account. There are no fees and the Cash App Card is a free debit card that can be used anywhere Visa is accepted. If you want to earn the 4.50% APY on Cash App Savings, though, you'll have to set up a monthly direct deposit of at least $300.

104,https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-a-thin-credit-file/,BLDR,Builders FirstSource,What is a thin credit file and how do you improve it?,"What does it mean to have a thin credit file?

Having a thin credit file means that you have little to no credit history to report on. In other words, companies don't have much access to information about your financial history. Experian says that if you have five or fewer accounts in your credit history that are tracked by one of the three main credit bureaus — Experian, TransUnion and Equifax — you would be defined as having a thin credit score. Many credit scoring models require at least one or two accounts to generate a credit report in addition to three to six months of payment activity. Some people may have a thin enough file that a credit score can not be generated. Individuals with thin credit files may receive less favorable terms from lenders or oftentimes have their applications denied outright. Don't miss: How to understand and check your credit score for free

Why would someone have a thin credit file?

There can be several reasons that someone might have a thin credit file, and many of them aren't necessarily negative. If you are relatively young you might not have had enough time to develop a strong credit profile. Similarly, if you recently immigrated to the U.S., your home country's credit history generally won't transfer over, meaning you might be building your credit file from scratch. In addition, some people try to avoid credit and will frequently use cash or debit cards to pay for purchases, both of which don't impact your credit score. If you had credit accounts in the past but not recently, this may also contribute to a thin credit file as accounts will fall off your record in about seven to ten years depending on the type of negative information.

How to build up a thin credit file

There are several ways you can fatten up your thin credit file. An easy way to improve a thin credit file is by using a secure credit card, such as the Discover it® Secured Credit Card. The Discover it Secured Credit Card allows you to earn rewards as you improve your credit score and offers a path to upgrading to an unsecured card as early as seven months after opening your card.

For some, taking out a credit-builder loan might be a good path toward beefing up their credit file. The Self Credit Builder Account requires no large upfront payment and users can choose from four different pricing options. This credit-builder loan works by holding your loan in a Certificate of Deposit (CD) that is FDIC-insured, you make monthly payments that are reported to all three major credit bureaus and at the end of your term, once you've paid off your loan, your CD matures and unlocks minus fees and interest.

Late fee Late fee of up to 5% of the monthly payment amount if you don't make the full monthly payment on your Credit Builder Account within 15 days of the payment due date Terms apply.

Another way to build your credit file is by paying bills on time utilizing *Experian Boost®. This is a free feature that allows users to link certain bills, like cell phone plans, utilities and streaming subscriptions, to Experian and get credit for positive, on-time payments. It's important to note not all types of payments are eligible and it will only influence your Experian credit report and score, not your credit scores with Equifax or TransUnion.

Bottom line

Having a thin credit file is not the same as having bad credit. However, it's still important to build up your credit history to gain access to more financial opportunities. Building up a large credit file can help financial institutions learn more about your financial habits and could aid you in getting better rates and opportunities down the line.

105,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/17/4-of-our-stocks-report-earnings-next-week-heres-what-we-want-to-see.html,BLDR,Builders FirstSource,4 of our stocks report earnings next week. Here's what we want to see from each,"Wall Street's five-week winning streak came to an end, with the S & P 500 losing 0.42% for the week, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.11% and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.82%. It was a roller coaster week driven largely by inflation data. A hotter-than-expected consumer price index on Tuesday sent stocks reeling, with the Dow posting its biggest drop in a year. Stocks bounced back over the next two days, helped by a softer retail sales report , only to slump again on Friday's hot producer price index for January. As we said this week, we're not overly concerned with the hotter-than-expected inflationary readings. One month does not make a trend, plus it shows a resilient economy and buys the Federal Reserve time to gather more data before cutting interest rates. Other notable reports: a weaker-than-expected January industrial production report and much weaker than expected January housing starts number, a decline of 14.8% month over month vs. expectations for a flat month. Earnings season picks back up for the Club next week, with four holdings set to report quarterly results. Overall, results have been solid: Of the 79% of S & P 500 companies that have reported so far, 75% reported an upside earnings surprise, while 65% reported better-than-expected revenue results, according to Fact Set. As a reminder, U.S. markets are closed on Monday, Feb. 19, in observance of Presidents Day. Palo Alto : Expectations are certainly high for this cybersecurity stock, which already made a sizable move up following results from peers Fortinet , Tenable , and Check Point on Feb. 6. All three beat expectations on the top and bottom lines and the consensus numbers for Palo Alto were not updated since then, according to FactSet. As a result, it's fair to assume that buy-side analysts will be disappointed by anything less than earnings, sales, and guidance all beating expectations. Free cash flow generation is another key watch item, as many analysts use this as the financial metric of choice for valuing Palo Alto. Aside from the numbers, we're interested to hear about the pace of deal activity and contract lengths, both of which have been headwinds. Contract lengths and deal timing can impact billings — which represent the total amount invoiced in a given period — we increased our focus on the remaining performance obligation (RPO), which includes both billings and the backlog of orders that have not been invoiced yet. It's not quite as secure due to the potential for cancelations, but still an important indicator of future sales. Shares of Palo Alto are up 24% this year, and nearly 107% over the past 12 months. Nvidia: The chipmaker's valuation still doesn't look all that demanding on a forward earnings basis, but the sheer size and speed of the rally we've seen in the stock — up nearly 47% this year — means that anything short of a beat and raise is almost certain to be met with a sell-off. Even with those beats, we might still see some profit-taking if the guidance isn't well above expectations. The good news: The expenditure outlook we got from some of Nvidia's largest customers — including Amazon , Microsoft , Alphabet , and Meta Platforms — should indeed result in a favorable outlook. A large part of the data center and AI infrastructure spending for these companies is going to Nvidia. Outside of the numbers, we want to hear about China and how the company is navigating export restrictions, along with any updates on the upcoming H200 and B100, both expected for release this year. Bausch Health: As for Bausch Health, we're not holding our breath. Even if the numbers come in better than expected, we expect the upside to be limited until the legal battle over Xifaxan is resolved (or we get some positive updates at the very least) and there is more certainty on the timing of the monetization of BCH's Bausch + Lomb stake. Coterra Energy . Management doesn't set the global prices of oil or gas, so what we're looking for is execution on things it can control. That means strong production on lower capital expenditure, which indicates production efficiency. Additionally, given the muted natural gas environment, we're curious to hear if they can shift their focus more toward oil production.

107,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/27/remote-workers-get-up-to-30percent-pay-increase-for-switching-to-in-office-jobs-says-new-research.html,BLDR,Builders FirstSource,"Remote workers could earn up to 30% more if they come in to the office 5 days a week, research shows","Getting people back to the office comes with a steep price tag — and those willing to swap their remote job for working in an office full-time could see the biggest change in their paychecks.

Salaries for fully in-office roles are climbing in the United States. Companies are offering an average $82,037 for in-person roles, a nearly 40% jump from what these roles paid in 2023 ($59,085), according to ZipRecruiter data provided to CNBC Make It.

Wages for remote and hybrid jobs haven't grown nearly as much. As of March 2024, hybrid roles pay $59,992 on average, in 2023, that number was $54,034, ZipRecruiter reports. Remote jobs now pay $75,327, but in 2023, they paid an average $69,107. ZipRecruiter's research is based on job listings from its platform and survey responses from more than 1,500 U.S. adults who started new jobs in 2023.

Those who switched from a remote job to an in-office job last year received a 29.2% pay bump — nearly double that of those who left an in-person job to work remotely. By comparison, job switchers who leave one remote role for another receive a 22.1% pay bump, while those who switch between in-office roles see a 23.2% increase in their salaries.

Johnny Bui, 25, left his remote consulting job in October 2023 for a hybrid position at the same level and is earning 33% more in his new role.

Bui, who works as a product analyst at Visa out of their Austin, Texas office, says he was happy to sacrifice the ability to work from home full time for better pay.

Given how competitive the job market has been in recent months — especially for remote roles — Bui says it's a ""fair trade-off.""

""People have gotten used to working remotely since the start of the pandemic to the point where it's become a habit, and habits are difficult to get rid of,"" he says. ""At the same time, a lot of people are motivated monetarily, so I think higher pay is a smart incentive to get people back to the office. It at least sweetens the pot.""

Interest in remote work remains strong even as fewer employers offer it. Despite making up less than 10% of all job postings in the U.S., remote jobs receive nearly half (46%) of all applications, according to recent research from LinkedIn.

Wage increases for in-person jobs coincide with more companies cracking down on enforcing their return-to-office mandates.

A whopping 90% of companies plan to implement some type of return-to-office policy by the end of 2024, an August 2023 Resume Builder survey found. Nearly 30% say their company will threaten to fire employees who don't comply with in-office requirements.

While some companies are taking more punitive approaches to enforce return-to-office mandates, others are using bigger paychecks as a tool to lure workers back to their desks.

""If employers can't compete on flexibility, they're having to compete more aggressively on pay,"" says Julia Pollak, ZipRecruiter's chief economist. ""The hope is that better pay might be enough to draw people back to the office,"" she adds.

It could work. Employees who split their time between home and the office say the top work perk that would get them to come in more is their company covering commuting costs, according to a recent report from videoconferencing company Owl Labs.

Giving workers higher salaries to offset the cost of commuting is one way to meet that demand, Pollak points out.

Some companies might also be using better compensation to improve retention. Turnover remains high in industries with fewer remote opportunities, including transportation, manufacturing, health care and leisure and hospitality.

""There's still quite a lot of churn in the industries where in-person work is more common,"" says Pollak. ""Employers in these fields might have experimented with short-term solutions to recruit more workers like sign-on bonuses or additional paid time off to get talent in the door, but those are just Band-Aids.""

She continues: ""It seems like more employers are realizing that you need long-term strategies, whether it's improving salaries or introducing better health-care packages, to hold on to your best workers.""

It's too soon to tell if higher salaries will be enough to convince people to choose an in-office job over a remote offer. Several studies have shown that people are willing to take a pay cut to work remotely.

FAQs What is a savings account bonus? A savings account bonus is essentially free cash or some other offering (i.e. bonus airline miles like with Bask Bank) that a bank will advertise, usually as an incentive for new customers to sign up.

There are often qualifications to ""earn"" the bonus, which may include things like setting up direct deposit or meeting a specified minimum balance within a certain time frame. When are savings account bonuses offered? Savings account bonuses are offered sort of at random. They are typically labeled as promotions that don't last long (which is why many have an expiration date), so if you see one that catches your eye you're best off acting quickly. Should I open a savings account for the bonus? You shouldn't always open a savings account just for the bonus. Know that bonus offer amounts can range, and higher-end bonuses tend to require a higher deposit of cash. Make sure to read the fine print to understand all the requirements needed to get the bonus cash, as well as understand any ongoing account fees like monthly maintenance costs. It's important to weigh the fees and other factors like interest rates before signing up for any new bank account. Which bank has the highest welcome bonus? At the time of writing this article, the banks with the highest savings welcome bonuses are PNC and U.S. Bank, which both offer up to a $400 bonus.

Bottom line

These savings accounts offering welcome bonuses up to $400 or thousands of airline miles can be a good option to move your money to, just make sure you read the qualifications beforehand.

Why trust CNBC Select?

At CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money. Every savings account review is based on rigorous reporting by our team of expert writers and editors with extensive knowledge of banking products. While CNBC Select earns a commission from affiliate partners on many offers and links, we create all our content without input from our commercial team or any outside third parties, and we pride ourselves on our journalistic standards and ethics. See our methodology for more information on how we choose the best savings accounts.

Our methodology

To determine which consumer savings accounts provide the best place to deposit your money and earn a bonus, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. savings accounts offered by the largest national banks, credit unions and online-only financial institutions. In addition to looking at savings account bonuses, we considered the requirements to earn their bonuses, plus any account fees, perks and interest rates offered. All the accounts included on this list are FDIC- or NCUA-insured of up to $250,000. This insurance protects and reimburses you up to your balance and the legal limit if your bank or credit union fails. Product and feature availability vary by market, so these accounts and bonuses may not be offered depending on where you live. Most brick-and-mortar banks require you to enter your zip code online for the correct account offerings. The rates and fee structures for savings accounts are subject to change without notice. Any return on your savings depends on any associated fees and the balance in your savings account. To open a savings account, most banks and institutions require a deposit of new money, meaning you can't transfer money you already had in an account at that bank. Catch up on CNBC Select's in-depth coverage of credit cards, banking and money, and follow us on TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to stay up to date. * SoFi members with direct deposit can earn up to 4.60% annual percentage yield (APY) on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50% APY on checking balances.

109,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/01/the-2023-stock-winners-investors-should-let-ride-sell-or-hedge-in-the-new-year.html,BLDR,Builders FirstSource,"The 2023 stock winners investors should let ride, sell or hedge in the new year","Two centuries ago one of the first economists, David Ricardo coined the still famous investment adage ""Let your profits run (on)."" Makes sense. All else equal, one would prefer to own or buy stocks in uptrends, and there have been some exceptional uptrends this year. Thirty-six Russell 1000 stocks are up more than 100%. What would Ricardo have done with his winners if he had options to trade? Here's my take. Let 'em ride: Several of 2023's best-performing stocks were grossly undervalued at the beginning of the year. In some cases for reasons that were easily identifiable both then and now. Arguably the best example is Meta . At its November 2022 low Meta traded down to $90 a share, less than 7 times the $13.71 in adjusted eps the company earned in FY2021. Although revenue growth paused in 2022 the company had a very strong balance sheet and had historically been a free cash flow generating powerhouse. The problem was that Mark Zuckerberg was losing billions, throwing money at his vision for the metaverse, and investors were concerned it had become an obsession taking precedence over the best course for the business. Many investors were quite vocal about their displeasure, but voicing their concerns was all they could do because Zuckerberg controls more than 50% of the voting rights through a special class of shares. So while investors recognized the company could deliver massive earnings and free cash flow, they were afraid Zuckerberg had gone off the reservation. Eventually, though he did elect to moderate his spending on his ambitious visions. The company has returned to record profitability and free cash flow generation and the stock has responded in kind, up 140% since the November 2022 low. While certainly not as cheap as it was a year ago, Meta remains cheap at not because it is trading at 20 times FY2024 EPS estimates of $18 a share, but because that represents 20% annual EPS growth. The stock sports topline growth, substantial margins, a strong balance sheet, substantial free cash flow, and a moat around its business. META's biggest threat is itself, and as long as management doesn't go back down the rabbit hole, it is a poster child for growth at a reasonable price (GARP). Other big winners for 2023 that remain well positioned for 2024 as long-term rates have dropped while unemployment has remained low include Vertiv Holding , Builders Firstsource , Topbuild Corp , and PulteHome . Nvidia and Uber are too, even despite the huge runs they've had at reasonable valuation given their respective growth rates, but bear in mind that some investors may have deferred taking gains in these and other large winners for tax reasons. Due to this and their high betas, any market choppiness in the market generally will affect these names more severely. It's time to hedge some of those gains (or take profits): The second best-performing stock in the Russell 1000 for 2023 is Coinbase (COIN) . As of year-end 2022, COIN was down more than 90% from its November 2021 peak. Investors shunned the stock as cryptocurrencies had plummeted. Bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, had fallen more than 76% from peak to trough, and it would be reasonable to assume that if cryptocurrencies continued to perform badly, speculators would trade them less often which would hurt the business of a crypto exchange. It did. Revenues fell nearly 60% year-over-year between FY2021 and FY2022. The company, which had made $21 in adjusted EPS in 2021, swung to a $6.63 a share loss. Unsurprisingly, as cryptocurrencies rebounded in 2023, so did COIN. What's surprising though is the degree to which it rebounded. Where bitcoin rose > 150%, COIN is up over 400%. Some businesses are indeed highly leveraged to prices for other goods or assets. Gold miners' prices are levered to the price of gold, oil companies to the price of oil, chip makers like MU to the price of NAND and DRAM and cryptocurrency miners and exchanges to the prices of the cryptocurrency. The issue I have with Coinbase is that despite the sharp increase in cryptocurrency prices, revenues and earnings have not rebounded in quite the same way. FY2024 revenue expectations of 2.9 billion are more than 60% below the company's zenith in 2021 of $7.8 billion. The company is expected to report FY2023 losses of 89 cents share. Street estimates are not forecasting a return to profitability until 2027. Why not? How is it that cryptocurrency prices can rebound so sharply and the company cannot return to the same level of profitability they saw in 2020 when the price of bitcoin for example was far lower than it is today? If I believed that Coinbase could reliably generate $4.7 billion in net income as it did in 2021 this thing would be ludicrously cheap, but it feels as if the landscape is shifting beneath the company's feet. Other companies I place in this category include Roku and SoFi . The single best-performing stock in the Russell 1000 for 2023 is Affirm , up nearly 420% year-to-date. Affirm Holdings is a popular buy now, pay later fintech company. How popular? It's growing topline at greater than 20%. Its popularity is understandable. In some cases, it offers purchases at zero interest, considerably more attractive than using a high-interest credit card. Additionally, these loans aren't currently reported to TransUnion or Equifax, so the impact of taking the loan on the borrower's credit score may be reduced, and in any case, borrowers may wish to preserve available credit lines for other uses. Likely, the company's partnerships with big online outlets such as Amazon and Walmart are going to show substantial gains during this holiday shopping season. The market opportunity is also substantial relative to the company's size. At $15 billion in market capitalization, Affirm is still tiny. To put things in perspective, the combined market capitalization of Visa and Mastercard is nearly $1 trillion. Paypal is nearly $70 billion. The problem here is that the idea of buy-now-pay-later isn't proprietary. Affirm is likely to face competition from other payment players. Charge-offs remain low, but we know that consumer credit balances have been rising steadily and are now at all-time highs. Auto loan delinquencies have also been rising. If the other large credit agencies TransUnion or Equifax eventually join Experian and begin tracking these loans, that would eliminate a perceived benefit by consumers. Ultimately though it comes down to a question of whether I would prefer to own money-losing Affirm based on their topline growth, or profitable Paypal for 1/10th the multiple betting they'll catch on to the portions of Affirm's business that are growing. If you own, but don't want to sell, consider purchasing the March $45/$35 put spread as a particle hedge, as illustrated below. The answer is simple, I'd much rather own PayPal (or the major credit card companies). Other names I place in this category include Palantir Technologies . Here too is a company that is growing, but it's unclear whether the growth targets may be a bit ambitious. Palantir relies heavily on government contracts, greater than 56% by revenue. Government business can be great, but it does introduce concentration risk as that segment of their revenue share indicates. One final thing: hedge when you can, not when you have to.

Why these two stocks look best positioned to capitalize,"A cyber breach at Okta , cyberattacks at casino giants MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment and an email hack at Microsoft . Cyberattacks may not be new, but experts say some crimes are growing in sophistication as new artificial intelligence tools emerge, and that's forcing companies to reconsider how they approach cybersecurity spending. ""This is not your old father's enterprise security threat profile,"" said Ted Mortonson , technology desk sector strategist at Baird. ""As we move to cloud and generative AI, it opens up massive total addressable markets, where security just has to be done a different way."" While a headache for companies, an uptick in cyberattacks coupled with emerging AI tools, may prove a boon for some of the world's biggest cybersecurity players, helping providers beef up their offerings on the one hand, and boost revenue as firms hunt for all-in-one solutions on the other. CRWD YTD mountain Crowdstrike shares year to date Key players in the space have already begun reaping the benefits of stronger demand. Palo Alto Networks and CrowdStrike have already surged more than 25% each only six weeks into the new year after proving among the best performers in the Nasdaq-100 in 2023. As this next stage unfolds, portfolio managers and investors view these large players as the best-positioned names to reap rewards thanks to their size, scale and resources. To be sure, opportunities abound across the software space, with Wall Street bullish on several popular names in the sector. But arguably, companies offering all-in-one solutions to mounting cybersecurity threats are viewed as sitting in the most advantageous position. ""It's a game of scale,"" Mortonson explained, noting that data and security solutions and generative AI infrastructures require a tremendous amount of internal free cash flow and research and development spending many smaller companies lack. ""That's how you get products to market that are next generation."" In a note to clients last month, Bernstein's Peter Weed initiated coverage of both companies with outperform ratings, citing leadership positions within firewall and endpoint markets and ""established sticky enterprise customer base for up-/cross-sell."" PANW YTD mountain Palo Alto Networks in 2024. And Bernstein isn't the only firm finding cybersecurity stocks attractive lately. Last month, Morgan Stanley analyst Hamza Fodderwala called Palo Alto Networks the investment bank's top pick in the sector, poised to benefit from rising demand for cyber protection and AI-driven security automation solutions. ""Cybersecurity remains a top IT priority in 2024 as rising threats, GenAI adoption and new regulatory requirements should bolster spending,"" he said. ""PANW remains the leading security platform consolidator by a wide margin, with share gain across multiple categories."" Meanwhile, Crowdstrike's endpoint security leadership puts it in a prime position to prosper from efforts to identify early threats in consumer devices, laptops and phones serving as entry points for hackers, said Hendi Susanto, a portfolio manager at Gamco Investors. This leading position is one reason Deepwater Asset Management's Doug Clinton retains a stake in Crowdstrike, along with Palo Alto Networks, in the core fund that he manages. ""Scale matters in this overall fight against AI being a tool used for cyber-attacks,"" he said. ""These companies see the most attacks and can use that data to inform your systems and make them smarter"" and better counteract attacks. Although CrowdStrike looks expensive, last trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 85, many on Wall Street view the steep valuation as warranted. In fact, JPMorgan's Brian Essex highlighted in a recent note to clients that CrowdStrike trades roughly in-line with peers when looked at on a growth adjusted basis, adding that ""fundamentals could push the stock meaningfully higher over the next few years,"" past a $100 billion market capitalization, up from today's market cap of $77 billion. ""With high incremental gross margins and best in class unit economics, CRWD has some of the best underlying operating and cash flow margin potential within our coverage universe,"" Essex wrote.

An activist hedge fund chaired by former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is pushing U.S. department store operator Kohl's to sell itself, according to people familiar with the matter.

Kohl's rejected acquisition offers worth as much as $64 per share in 2022, when it also came under pressure from several activist shareholders to explore a sale.

It held on for a bid worth more than $70 per share that never came, and has since struggled to make its stores more profitable and grow its e-commerce business. Its shares are now hovering at around $26.

Vision One Management Partners, a fund co-founded by Harper and former Carl Icahn protégé Courtney Mather, has built a stake in Kohl's and expressed concerns to the company about its future, the sources said.

Vision One has asked Kohl's to launch a sale process and also give it board representation, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.

Kohl's was not available for comment and Vision One did not respond to requests for comment.

The development makes Kohl's the second U.S. department store operator to come under investor pressure to sell itself in as many months.

FanDuel parent Flutter listed on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, offering U.S. investors an alternative to the biggest pure play in sports betting, DraftKings . It's a secondary listing for the international sportsbook, which will retain its primary listing on the London Stock Exchange and inclusion in the FTSE 100 index. But Flutter's most important market for revenue and growth is the United States, where FanDuel is the market share leader. In the fourth quarter, FanDuel had 43% market share based on gross revenue and 51% based on net revenue.

But while FanDuel outperforms its competitors, its biggest rival, DraftKings, grabs the headlines and spotlight in earned media as the biggest — some might argue, the only — publicly traded pure play in sports betting. Shares of DraftKings have soared more than 150% over the last 12 months and are up 9% year to date. Flutter wants some of the glory and some of the capital for FanDuel. Its shares are trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol FLUT . Flutter CEO Peter Jackson put it more diplomatically on Jan. 18, saying, ""The additional listing will enable us to access deeper capital markets as well as making Flutter more accessible to U.S. investors and marks a new chapter in the history of the Flutter Group.""

Jefferies believes the NYSE listing could be a short-term catalyst for Flutter. In a note published Friday, analyst James Wheatcroft assumes a 20% premium to DraftKings' valuation, because of FanDuel's ""sustained market share outperformance,"" and implies a price target of £210. Flutter is currently trading at £163 per share in London. While DraftKings has gathered momentum since its public listing via SPAC in April 2020, hitting an all-time intraday high of $74.38 on March 22, 2021, it has lagged FanDuel in posting profits. Other competitors have become profitable in certain quarters, though they have failed to gain significant market share. BetMGM, jointly owned by MGM Resorts International and Entain, has seen its market leader status in iGaming, or online casino games, slip, as DraftKings and FanDuel have overtaken it.

The difference between nonrenewal and cancellation

A nonrenewal notice is sent shortly before the end of your policy's specified term. Your carrier may decide not to renew your policy for a variety of reasons, from deciding your property is poorly maintained to no longer offering coverage in your area. Cancellation, however, happens while your policy is still active. Depending on the state and the provider, a carrier can cancel your policy for any reason if it's been in force for less than 60 days. After that, there are only a few approved reasons, according to the Insurance Information Institute (III), including nonpayment, fraud or changes to the property that make it uninsurable.

Why your homeowner insurance was nonrenewed

There are several reasons why a provider may decide to issue a nonrenewal notice. You've made too many claims

Your insurance score has dropped

Liability hazards on your property have increased, like an aging roof or HVAC system

Non-covered features have been added, like a trampoline or swimming pool.

You adopted a pet that's excluded from coverage

Your insurer is no longer providing coverage in your area. In states prone to hurricanes and other severe weather, a number of insurance companies have limited or even ceased issuing home insurance: At least a dozen providers have stopped doing business in Florida since 2022, including State Farm. State Farm and Allstate have stopped writing new home insurance policies In California, and other carriers have scaled back in regions plagued by wildfires.

What to do if you get a nonrenewal notice

Carriers must give customers advance notice of a decision not to renew, typically between 30 and 90 days, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). During this period, you can contest the decision or look around for coverage somewhere else. Appeal Most states require an insurer to explain why it's not renewing before it officially drops your policy, according to the Insurance Information Institute (III). If you have addressed the issue or think they made a mistake, reach out to your carrier's consumer affairs division about reconsidering. You may need to present documentation or submit to a home inspection. If that isn't successful, you can also contact your state's insurance department. Shop for another insurer Not being renewed doesn't mean you can't get insurance from another carrier or that you'll have to pay higher premiums. Get quotes from several companies to find the best price and fit. Nationwide is one of the top insurers for customer satisfaction, according to J.D. Power's 2023 Property Claims Satisfaction Study, and it offers numerous discounts, including for bundling, being a first-time homebuyer and installing security, safety or smart-home devices.

How to get homeowners insurance after being dropped

While your carrier will give you some warning that you're being dropped, you should start looking for new coverage right away. Otherwise, a mortgage provider may assign you force-placed insurance, a policy that protects your lender and can cost twice as much as a traditional policy, according to the CFPB.



If you're facing a cancellation or nonrenewal, find out why. If it's something you can fix, like a roof that needs to be repaired, take the necessary steps to keep your current policy. If it's not something you can fix — for example, if you installed a swimming pool and your insurer doesn't cover them — look for companies that do. If coverage was not renewed because the insurer is no longer offering policies in your state, filter your search for carriers that are. You can look on insurance marketplace sites, get information from your state's insurance department or ask your neighbors what carrier they use. If you've received several rejections on the voluntary market, there are also special programs available to insure risky properties. FAIR Plans Many states have Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plans, which allow high-risk homeowners to get coverage if they've been rejected by traditional carriers. Coverage with a FAIR plan is typically more expensive and may cover less, according to the III. Some plans also may require upgrades to electrical or heating systems. To see if you are eligible for a FAIR plan, contact your state's insurance department. HO-8 policy Most standard homeowners insurance plans are HO-3 policies, which cover the home's physical structure, as well as your personal belongings, your liability in the event of an injury and additional living expenses if you have to relocate. An HO-8 policy provides similar coverage but only reimburses you for the actual cash value of the damaged or destroyed property or possessions, not their replacement cost. It's intended for older homes (built more than 40 years ago) or ones with historical significance, where the cost of replacing the loss would be more than the house's fair market value HO-8 policies only cover named perils, typically damage from: Fire, smoke and lightning

Hail and windstorms

Explosions

Civil unrest

Vehicles, including airplanes

Theft or vandalism

Volcanic eruptions Other perils not listed, like water damage from a burst pipe, would not be covered. Surplus lines policy Surplus line insurance is another option if your homeowners policy has been canceled or not renewed. Many states allow insurance companies to issue policies within their borders even if they're not licensed in that state. To qualify for surplus line insurance, you must have been rejected by at least three to five carriers, according to the III. Because the risk is higher, policies usually have higher deductibles and more exclusions. Check with your state's insurance department to see what options are available.

FAQ

FAQs Can I dispute a nonrenewal notice? You can dispute the nonrenewal with your insurance company directly or reach out to your state's department of insurance. Does a notice of nonrenewal mean I'll pay more for insurance in the future? Not necessarily. Each carrier has its own formula for determining costs and approvals and being nonrenewed by one doesn't mean you'll be rejected or have to pay more to another company. How much notice is required if my insurance company is not renewing my policy? Requirements vary by state, but typically an insurer is required to give you at least 30 to 60 days' notice before deciding not to renew. Check with your state's insurance department to see how much notice is required in your area. Can getting a dog lead to nonrenewal of my homeowners insurance? Getting a pet can change your status with an insurance company: Some breeds of dogs — including Doberman pinschers, pit bulls and Great Danes — are considered higher risk and could lead to nonrenewal. If you have to file a claim for a dog bite, you could also face nonrenewal or the dog being excluded from coverage.

Bottom line

The precious metal has hit successive record highs this year, including another on Thursday when spot gold broke above $2,300 before easing slightly. Early Friday it was trading around $2278 per ounce.

The reasons behind its climb — and how much higher it can go in the near to medium-term — are hot topics among investors, especially as stock market gains remain robust.

Juerg Kiener, chief investment officer at Swiss Asia Capital, told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Wednesday that his forward curve analysis for gold ""looks fantastic.""

""If you look at your forward curve for a year it's about 26 [$2,600]. I think we might be really fast as we take 23 [$2,300] out, it has a lot of pent-up demand,"" he said.

He added that an inventory collapse in the gold market is putting ""a lot of derivative structures at risk.""

""It puts probably a lot of structures which are in the market playing gold at risk too, because [traders] might not be able to cover [their short positions]. And if I say that 26 is for me just a forward curve, in case we get a short squeeze the numbers will go much higher.""

A short squeeze is when the price of an asset rises sharply and those with short positions — who were betting on price falls — are forced to buy the asset to prevent more losses, typically driving up the price even further.

Kiener also cited geopolitics, a shift to a ""multipolar world,"" and changing international trade structures as reasons for his bullishness on the gold price. Another was governments ""printing money like there's no tomorrow,"" he added.

Gold is typically viewed as a so-called safe haven asset and also as a potential hedge against inflation.

Geopolitics has been cited by several analysts as the basis of a medium-term bullish case for gold, amid the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, the upcoming U.S. election and the possibility of recession in major economies. Another commonly cited factor is the likelihood of interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, of which three are expected this year. Lower borrowing costs tend to increase the appeal of gold as investors shift away from fixed-income assets like bonds.

""We've got a massive flow of precious metal leaving the West,"" he said, adding that there was a ""real shift"" toward precious growing demand in Asia and the BRIC countries more broadly.",4/5/2024,1,0.864549041,0.060551226,0.001531072,0.051342525,0.019046837,0.002979217

Inflation jumped in March as prices for consumer staples such as gasoline edged higher and those for housing remained stubbornly high, suggesting inflation may be a bit stickier than it seemed just a few months ago, economists said. The consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, rose 3.5% in March from a year ago, the U.S. Labor Department reported Wednesday. That's up from 3.2% in February. CPI measures how fast prices are changing across the U.S. economy. It measures everything from fruits and vegetables to haircuts, concert tickets and household appliances.

The March inflation reading is down significantly from its 9.1% pandemic-era peak in 2022, which was the highest level since 1981. However, it remains above policymakers' long-term target, around 2%. Progress in the inflation fight has somewhat flatlined in recent months. ""The disinflation has stalled out,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""The big rock in the way here is the cost of shelter,"" Zandi said. While housing costs have moderated, they account for the largest share of the CPI inflation index and ""are still growing strongly,"" he said.

Despite progress having stalled, broader evidence doesn't suggest a renewed surge in inflation — though it may take longer than expected to bring the rate back to target, economists said. In fact, underlying inflation after stripping out shelter costs is already back to target, Zandi said. ""I still hold to the view that inflation is moderating,"" Zandi said. ""It's just taking frustratingly long to get there.""

Household paychecks can buy more stuff, though

Higher oil and gas prices take a toll

Gasoline prices increased 1.7% from February to March, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. This figure is adjusted to account for seasonal buying patterns. Average U.S. pump prices were $3.52 a gallon on April 1, up from $3.35 on March 4, according to weekly data published by the Energy Information Administration.

watch now

The increase is largely attributable to higher oil prices. They've firmed amid a generally positive outlook for the global economy, meaning greater global oil demand, and controlled output among major oil-producing nations, meaning there hasn't been a glut of oil, economists said. Tensions in the Middle East may also be playing a role, Hamrick said.

Higher gas prices may filter through to higher prices elsewhere, since they factor into transportation and distribution costs for goods and even services such as food delivery, he said. Higher energy prices are what worries Zandi most relative to inflation readings. It's likely the upward trend will continue in coming months, and the dynamic negatively impacts consumer buying power and sentiment, he said. ""Nothing does more damage to the economy more quickly than rising oil and gasoline prices,"" he said.

Other 'notable' areas of inflation

The BLS said that motor vehicle insurance, medical care, recreation and personal care, in addition to shelter, were ""notable"" contributors to ""core"" inflation, a reading that strips out volatile energy and food prices. Shelter, motor vehicle insurance, medical care, apparel and personal care were notable contributors to monthly inflation from February to March, the agency said.

The overall monthly CPI reading, 0.4%, was much higher than the roughly 0.2% that would be expected on a consistent basis to bring inflation back to normal, economists said. ""There is no improvement here; we're moving in the wrong direction,"" Hamrick said. ""The usual trouble spots persist,"" said Hamrick, who additionally called out costs for electricity and car maintenance and repairs.

Prices have fallen in some categories

Meanwhile, some consumer categories have seen improvement. Prices fell for used cars and trucks, new vehicles and airline tickets between February and March, for example. They're also down over the past year, by 2.2%, 0.1% and 7.1%, respectively, according to CPI data. Lower prices for new and used cars should lead auto insurance and repair costs to fall as well, economists said.

Grocery prices are another bright spot, they said. While some categories, such as eggs and pork chops, have seen recent upward movement, the overall ""food at home"" index stood at 0% on a monthly basis in both February and March. ""Food prices have come to a standstill,"" Zandi said. ""For most Americans, the thing that bothers them the most about inflation is high food prices.""

Supply-and-demand dynamics

At a high level, supply-and-demand imbalances are what trigger out-of-whack inflation. For example, the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains for goods. Americans' buying patterns also simultaneously shifted away from services — such as entertainment and travel — toward physical goods since they stayed at home more, driving up demand and fueling decades-high goods inflation. Additionally, supply-and-demand dynamics in the labor market pushed wage growth to the highest level in decades, putting upward pressure on prices for services, which are more wage-sensitive. Now that supply-chain issues are ""pretty close to fixed,"" there's ""little scope"" for goods to contribute to disinflation moving forward, said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Economics.

JPMorgan has an overweight rating on Bank of America, while used vehicle platform CarMax is rated underweight. Analyst Vivek Juneja added Bank of America as a value idea. However, his price target of $35 implies that shares could fall 8% from their Thursday close. Shares of Bank of America have risen 12% in 2024. Juneja thinks the stock has the potential to rise further due to several factors. ""We believe Bank of America's stock has lagged peers partly due to concerns about net interest income — we expect net interest income trends to hold up better than previously expected led by deposits, which should allow its stock performance to catch up,"" he wrote. The analyst also sees the bank benefiting from a pickup in capital markets activity this year. ""Bank of America should benefit relatively more than peers from continued growth in trading and investment banking activity as it continues to invest in those businesses and likely continues to outperform peers in some of these areas,"" he added. On the other hand, analyst Rajat Gupta views CarMax as a short idea, with his $60 price target suggesting approximately 31% downside from where the stock closed on Thursday. CarMax has popped nearly 12% this year. ""After the recent rally, driven more by macro headlines around tax refunds and interest rates rather than fundamentals, which remain choppy, risk-reward is now squarely skewed to the downside, in our view,"" the analyst wrote.

Who does well and who struggles,"A robust economy, with earnings still strong but inflation sticky, creates a tricky narrative for active investors. To see the impact of higher inflation and higher interest rates on companies, just look at the earnings release for CarMax this morning. Earnings and revenue in its latest February quarter missed estimates and it pushed back its goal of selling 2 million cars by 2026 to sometime between 2026 and 2030. What did CarMax blame? ""We believe vehicle affordability challenges continued to impact our fourth-quarter unit sales performance, with ongoing headwinds due to widespread inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, tightened lending standards and low consumer confidence,"" a statement said. Overall, this is a very tough environment for small cap stocks, speculative technology (think Cathie Wood/ARK), REITs, and utilities. For example, higher rates are generally bad for REITs because REITs rely on debt financing. Rising rates increase borrowing costs, and higher borrowing costs reduce profit margins. But long-term, the effects can be more subtle. For example, if rates go up because economic growth is strong, REITs can benefit long-term. It's usually also bad for utilities, because when rates rise Treasury bonds become more attractive due to higher yields. Higher rates also mean increased borrowing costs for utilities, which carry a lot of debt because they use a lot of capital. If utilities can't pass on the higher costs, their shareholders suffer. Some sectors do well with rising rates The reflation trades means a newfound focus on cyclical stocks that perform best when the economy turns up, such as energy, materials and hospitality. The problem is, energy and materials stocks have already been rising due to higher oil and a still strong economy. Energy is the second-best performer among S & P sectors year to date, up 17%. Communication services, led by a big move in Meta , is the leader, up 18%. Other potential beneficiaries of higher rates with a strong economy are defensive stocks, which tend to be less interest rate-sensitive, such as Kroger or Walmart . Another potential beneficiary is insurance stocks. Life insurance companies, for example, take the premiums they get from customers and invest them in bonds. When rates go up, they get more yield from those bonds, which generates more investment income. Key is strong economy and continued job growth If that changes, in particular if the job market weakens significantly and we still have inflation higher than desirable, that will be stagflation, and that will be a much bigger problem for the markets. The key is that the economy has to stay strong, which will help prop up earnings. Earnings have remained stable on the strong economy. First-quarter estimates have been steady in the past few weeks, with the S & P 500 expected to see gains of 5%, according to LSEG, and full-year growth in 2024 up 9.8%, little changed from the 11% gain expected on Jan. 1. All of this changes if the economy, particularly jobs, turns south. Job growth contracting alongside sticky inflation means ""stagflation,"" and if the market comes to believe that is a likely scenario, forget it. The S & P 500, which closed Wednesday at 5,160, will be in the mid-4,000s very quickly.",4/11/2024,-1,0.960543394,0.018045284,0.000691781,0.015856322,0.004222801,0.000640482

Iranian-backed Houthi militants on Tuesday launched a widespread attack on merchant ships in the Red Sea. It marked the 26th such attack since Nov. 19. About 50 vessels were in the vicinity.

But there were no reports of injuries or ship damage.

In addition to the U.S.-led Operation Prosperity Guardian coalition warships and information-sharing teams, Task Force 59, a network of sensors, is helping protect the passage of commercial ships through the Red Sea.

Launched in 2021, it is the U.S. Navy's first unmanned and artificial intelligence-driven task force. It uses a combination of unmanned systems and AI designed to create a digital horizon to detect any anomalies on the water and the ocean floor.

Over the past two years, the task force has completed more than 30 exercises and 50,000 operating hours at sea with international players.

Defense officials told CNBC that since the beginning of Operation Prosperity Guardian on Dec. 18, U.S. and coalition forces have shot down more than 100 attack drones and missiles, while sinking at least three small boats — this includes Tuesday's Red Sea engagement. Carriers have continued to shift vessels outside of the crucial trade route, although the U.S. aims to help the global supply chain get back to normal.

Task Force 59's operating platforms are equipped with sensors, radars and cameras for many uses, including navigation, data collection, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.

The soon to-be-expanded hub handles 2,000 tons of cargo, or 100,000 parcels and documents every business day. Up to 60 cargo planes land every weeknight.

The Houthi attacks in the Red Sea are not only driving up sea freight — air freights are going to get higher too, as global trade flows get increasingly disrupted.

In the past weeks, ocean freight rates have risen as much as $10,000 per 40-foot container, as container ships seeking to avoid the attacks embarked on long detours around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, diverting more than $200 billion of cargo away from the critical trade artery.

The delays to maritime trade may prompt some retailers to switch to air freight, as companies that normally ship their goods by sea want to ensure faster delivery, analysts said.

This means that air cargo is about to play an expanded role in the supply chain ecosystem. Air freight can slash delivery times to just a few days compared to weeks taken by ocean carriers.

""Some shippers are already in survival mode with one goal on their mind: 'Make sure my freight moves by whatever means possible,'"" Matthew Burgess, vice president of global ocean services at C.H. Robinson said.",1/17/2024,0,0.530460835,0.008510241,0.001531244,0.163526773,0.292860687,0.003110256

Airbus is nearing an order from Delta Air Lines for dozens of wide-body jets including extra A350-1000 aircraft, industry sources told Reuters.

Depending on last-minute negotiations, a deal could be made public as early as Friday when the U.S. carrier reports its fourth-quarter earnings, they said.

Airbus declined to comment. Delta said it does not comment on industry speculation.

While the Atlanta-based carrier placed an order for 100 Boeing 737 MAX 10 jets in 2022, it has primarily been an Airbus customer.

At the end of September the company had 65 Airbus A330 and 28 A350-900 wide-bodies, with commitments to purchase another 16 each.

The twin-aisle jets are expected to help the company to grow its network in Asia-Pacific, which has lagged behind the U.S. and Europe in global travel demand recovery after the pandemic.

However, U.S. airlines are betting on the region as the next source of high-margin revenue at a time of soaring costs. In the current quarter, Delta, United Airlines and American Airlines are estimated to increase seats on their flights to the region by more than 70% from a year ago.

Cramer said the Federal Reserve prefers to use the PCE index, not the consumer price index, to best evaluate inflation. If the number comes in too hot, Cramer said any market gains may prove to be short-lived. But if the number is cool, it could give most stocks a lift.

He warned that even if the market is oversold next week, the PCE index report on Friday will be where the rubber truly meets the road.

On Monday, Verizon will report its quarterly results before the market opens, and two steel companies, Nucor and Cleveland Cliffs , will report after the close. Cramer said the latter companies could be strong, noting that Nucor in particular has performed well during the aggressive rate tightening.

Companies like GM , GE Aerospace and Spotify report on Tuesday, but Cramer said Tesla is the one to watch that day. He said the electric vehicle maker had a rough quarter and noted concerns about the company's weak sales, as well as the possibility for a substantial decline in cash flow.

The fun doesn't stop there, as the embattled plane-maker Boeing reports results Wednesday morning, and the social media giant Meta will post earnings after the bell. Cramer said analysts largely agree that Meta will report rosy numbers, which means CEO Mark Zuckerberg, unlike Tesla CEO Elon Musk, will not have to pull a rabbit out of a hat.

On Thursday, Caterpillar , Merck and the tech giants Microsoft and Alphabet will release earnings. With Alphabet's business model based on advertising, Cramer warned that the company does have a tendency to perform badly at earnings time, though there could be a bright spot because of its developments in artificial intelligence.

Oil companies Exxon Mobil and Chevron report on Friday.

Next week will spotlight the bulk of the Magnificent Seven names, which had a strong start to the year, but have been in a slump as of late. Tesla reports Tuesday, Meta Platforms is out Wednesday. Thursday serves a double whammy with Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft . But those results are coming at a time when investors are on edge, uncertain where markets are heading after a pushback in rate cut expectations, a recent rise in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, as well as a spike in Treasury yields. On Friday, the S & P 500 was more than 5% off its 52-week high; it also dipped below 5,000, a level the broader index had only reached for the first time ever in February. Wall Street is hoping next week's megacap tech results will give investors insight into where the artificial intelligence trade is going from here, as a bounce in tech could lift the indexes. They're also hoping a slew consumer commentary will give investors insight into the state of the economy. ""Every week of earnings is the most pivotal one, but I really think this one is the most pivotal one,"" said Kim Forrest, founder at Bokeh Capital, adding, ""I think everybody is like me looking to next week thinking, 'This will be the time where we can figure out the direction of the market.'"" On Friday, the S & P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite registered losing weeks. Further gains, or buying opportunity? As a whole, the bar is high for the Magnificent Seven, even as there are increasing divergences between the names. Tesla, for example, will be in the spotlight next week. Investors are hoping for some positive news out of electric vehicle maker, which is the second-worst performer in the S & P 500 this year as it contends with slowing sales and rising competition from China. This week, Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock to hold from buy following a Reuters report of the possible scrapping of a low-cost car. In response, CEO Elon Musk said Reuters was ""lying."" Shares were down 14% this week. Investors a sense of how artificial intelligence will be monetized, seeking insight into growing Google's cloud business , as well as Microsoft's Copilot chatbot. ""These will give us some of the best indications of AI demand,"" said Emily Leveille, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, adding, ""We expect earnings, I think, to be pretty good for at least for Microsoft and for Meta, just considering sort of recent momentum in earnings growth."" Horizon Investments' Scott Ladner urged caution ahead of the reports given the high expectations swirling around the megacaps. However, he said any pullback in the tech names could give investors an opening to start ""nibbling away"" at additional exposure. While the investment chief anticipates further volatility over the next several weeks, he said he anticipates stocks can again rise over the intermediate term, and gain another 10% from here. ""Especially with the AI trade, those expectations have been ramped up. And so, we would probably be a little bit cautious in terms of getting exposure to those names ahead of earnings releases because that bar is quite high,"" Ladner said. ""But if we do get a sell-off associated with those releases that don't hit up on those raised expectations, it probably is, we think, a better buying opportunity than a selling opportunity at that point,"" Ladner added. He also advised investors to start adding exposure to other interesting assets such as in Europe, or in small caps, which could jump after the central bank cuts rates later this year. Consumer focus Wall Street is also anticipating commentary from consumer-facing companies next week that could give insight into the state of the economy. Investors are hoping that consumer spending, which has thus far held up the economy in the face of higher prices, remains robust. Earnings results from Visa, for example, will be on deck. ""From a sentiment standpoint, consumers don't feel very good, but they haven't acted like that for the better part of years,"" Horizon's Ladner said. ""So, the bigger thing that we've been looking for and look for this quarter, is, are the consumers still acting like they're in good shape? Even if they feel a little bit down in the dumps because they don't like the price that they're paying for things, are they are they still paying those prices? Are they still borrowing? Are they still consuming?"" ""So long as that is continues to be the case, which we expect it to be, we think this consumer-facing company is probably going to have a pretty good rebound in the second half of the year,"" Ladner added. On the economic front, next week will also bring the first-quarter gross domestic product number.

An insurer has to be financially healthy to be able to pay out claims. As an independent credit rating agency, A.M. Best translates balance sheets and other data into letter grades that can be understood by consumers, investors and others in the insurance industry. A.M. Best reviews and rates over 16,000 insurance companies globally, from household names to niche providers. Grades range from A+ to D, and each grade may also have a notch (or an additional ""+"") to indicate its strength within that grade. For example, an A+ company with an outstanding ability to meet its obligations would be categorized as A++. A.M. Best's grades are relevant to all kinds of insurance. A life insurance policy, for example, may not pay out for decades. So it's important for a life insurance company to be in good financial standing for the long haul. Northwestern Mutual, New York Life and MassMutual all received A++ ratings from A.M. Best in 2023.

How does A.M. Best rate insurance companies?

A.M. Best grades insurers' credit in several categories, including their ability to meet their short- term, long-term and ongoing financial obligations. It's best known for its financial strength ratings (FSRs), however, which look at a company's ability to meet all of its policy and contract obligations. According to A.M. Best, the ratings are predictions based on balance sheet strength, performance, business profile information and other data. As such, they're not a guarantee of future performance or meant as investment advice. To calculate ratings, A.M. Best says its analysts make ""quantitative and qualitative evaluations of balance sheet strength, operating performance, business profile and enterprise risk management"" and bring their findings to a committee, which votes on a rating recommendation.

What is the A.M. Best rating scale?

A.M. Best grades insurance companies on financial health by assigning them letter grades ranging from A+ to D. These grades can also include a notch to further distinguish financial strength within a grade. An A+ company with superior financial strength, for example, would be graded as A++. And a B company with less solvency could be graded as B-. These are the grade categories, based on A.M. Best's belief in a company's ability to meet ongoing obligations. Superior : Rating: A+, Notches: A++

: Rating: A+, Notches: A++ Excellent : Rating: A, Notches: A-

: Rating: A, Notches: A- Good : Rating: B+, Notches: B++

: Rating: B+, Notches: B++ Fair : Rating: B, Notches: B-

: Rating: B, Notches: B- Marginal: Rating: C+, Notches: C++

Rating: C+, Notches: C++ Weak : Rating: C, Notches: C-

: Rating: C, Notches: C- Poor: Rating: D An Under Review modifier, or ""U,"" may also be added to a company's grade if there is a potential for a near-term change to its score, usually within the next six months. The Under Review marker can imply positive or negative results. Under review with positive implications: There is a reasonable likelihood the grade will be raised as a result of recent information.

There is a reasonable likelihood the grade will be raised as a result of recent information. Under review with negative implications: The company is facing unfavorable financial or market conditions and has a good possibility of a rating downgrade.

The company is facing unfavorable financial or market conditions and has a good possibility of a rating downgrade. Under review with developing implications: There is still uncertainty as to the outcome of the review.

How to use A.M. Best's ratings

FSRs distill a lot of financial information into an accessible format, providing an important metric you can use to evaluate an insurance company. To ensure a score is current and accurate, get it from the A.M Best website directly.

Major carriers like State Farm and Allstate have numerous subsidiaries for property, auto and other insurance categories and A.M. Best grades each separately. Make sure you're looking at the right one.

Look beyond the score to the factors that led A.M Best to give a company its grade and notch to see if they concern you.

Review an insurer's grade over time for an idea of its long-term financial health.

Look at scores from other credit rating agencies for comparison, including S&P Global and Moody's. FSRs shouldn't be the sole reason to purchase or switch to a particular carrier, especially since they don't consider rates and terms for a specific policy. They also don't address customer satisfaction — the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' Complaint Index, J.D. Power's customer satisfaction ratings and the Better Business Bureau's grades are more helpful there. Shop for your next homeowners insurance policy

Analysts surveyed by LSEG had called for earnings of $8.56 per share on revenue of $12.92 billion, meanwhile. Logitech — Shares pulled back roughly 2% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the computer peripherals stock to underweight. Analyst Erik Woodring thinks the market is ""mis-pricing"" Logitech's outlook and forecasts only 3% annual revenue growth through fiscal year 2027.

Analyst Rick Wise said he sees ""room for further share price appreciation,"" citing as catalysts the bank's business improvement and gross margin expansion opportunities. Salesforce — Shares slid nearly 3% in premarket trading, following reports from the Wall Street Journal and Reuters that the software company is in advanced talks to acquire Informatica, a data management firm. Medical Properties Trust — Shares soared 14% after the real estate investment trust said that it would sell its majority interests in five Utah hospitals to a new joint venture, with the deal coming to a total valuation of $886 million.

Analyst Maheep Mandloi initiated coverage of GE Vernova with a buy rating, saying the company will get a boost from its diversified businesses in gas, in wind, as well as in grid services. ""We favor GEV as it benefits from leadership in the gas power business that generates recurring and increasing cash flow, margin expansion in wind due to pricing power and an unprofitable offshore backlog ending by 2026, and its strong presence in grid services and electrification,"" Mandloi wrote on Monday. ""We expect the company to approach a 10% Adj EBITDA margin exiting 2026 (vs 1.7% in 2023), much earlier than guidance of 2028,"" Mandloi added.

The firm initiated coverage of the restaurant chain stock with an equal weight rating and a $58 per share price target. Barclays' forecast calls for 9% downside moving forward from Friday's close. ""CAVA's revenue growth is industry leading, culminating in long-term annual guidance for high teens growth, supported by 15%+ unit & low-to-mid-single-digit comp growth, both proving conservative to date,"" analyst Jeffrey A.

The firm reiterated an overweight rating with a $475 per share price target. Barclays' forecast implies nearly 13% upside from Friday's $421.90 close. ""Given that this was the heaviest period of optimizations for businesses, we see an upside scenario similar to prior quarters,"" analyst Raimo Lenschow said. ""Results here, coupled with further commentary around AI momentum in both Azure and Office, should be enough to send shares higher, in our view,"" he added.

Reddit has climbed more than 24% since going public in March at a debut price of $34 per share, which was the top range of analyst estimates. But Morgan Stanley's Brian Nowak said that, while Reddit is a ""unique"" platform, he is somewhat cautious on the stock as the company needs to prove it can meaningfully grow both user and revenue growth. ""In our view, it is still early in Reddit's user growth story and in the near-term we see RDDT benefitting from growing top of funnel, deepening engagement by improving relevance and driving international user growth,"" Nowak said. — Brian Evans 5:44 a.m.: Canaccord initiates Coty as buy A turnaround is in the cards for Coty , according to Canaccord Genuity. Analyst Susan Anderson initiated the beauty products company with a buy rating . Her price target of $14 implies upside of 33% from Friday's close. ""With management focused on investing and growing in fast-growing beauty categories, we believe Coty can outpace growth in the total market and has multiple levers to achieve this in the long term,"" Anderson said. ""Despite concerns around an overall slowdown in the beauty market in the U.S., we believe Coty can outperform due to significant whitespace growth opportunities, exposure to high-growth global beauty markets, and strong brands keeping consumers interested,"" Anderson added.

The price of the flagship cryptocurrency was last higher by 3% at $72,022.16, according to Coin Metrics. Earlier, it reached an all-time high of $72,750.16.

At the same time, heightened leverage in the crypto market has led to the biggest price swings in nearly a year, with funding rates at their highest levels since January 2021 and bitcoin open interest at all-time highs.

Inflows into U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs continue to drive the cryptocurrency's price action. Last week, crypto investment products saw record inflows totaling $2.7 billion, according to CoinShares. That put the year-to-date total at $10.3 billion, just off the record of $10.6 billion for all of 2021.

Meanwhile, ether broke $4,000 for the first time since December 2021, lifted in part by bitcoin. It was last higher by 3% at $4,034.00.

Investors were also looking ahead to the Ethereum network's next big tech upgrade, dubbed ""Dencun,"" this week. In the past, the crypto asset has rallied into the day of the upgrade and then seen traders sell on the event.

Citi analyst Alex Saunders pointed out in a note Monday that price action could look different for Dencun given the strength of other key crypto catalysts in play at the moment – specifically, the inflows into bitcoin ETFs, the upcoming Bitcoin halving and the potential that the Securities and Exchange Commission could approve trading of spot ether ETFs in the U.S. in May.

Companies whose performance is tied to the price of bitcoin was mixed on Monday. Crypto exchange Coinbase advanced gave back earlier gains but closed just under flat as the broader rally in tech cooled. Bitcoin proxy Microstrategy rose 4% after the company purchased another roughly 12,000 bitcoins for more than $821 million in cash, according to a filing.

Miners fell. Marathon Digital lost 12%, CleanSpark fell 16%, Iris Energy lost 5% and Riot Platforms slipped 4%. These were some of the biggest stock market gainers in February but have turned lower for March as investors digest the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, when mining companies' revenue will be slashed.

New U.K. crypto trading products

Elsewhere, the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority said Monday that it would allow exchanges to list cryptocurrency-linked exchange-traded products for the first time – two months after spot bitcoin ETFs began trading in the U.S.

Specifically, the FCA said it would not object to requests from recognized investment exchanges to create a U.K.-listed market segment for crypto-backed exchange-traded notes, or ETNs. The London Stock Exchange said it will accept applications for the admission of bitcoin and ether ETNs from the second quarter of this year.

Unlike an ETF, which is a fund that holds assets, an ETN is an unsecured debt security issued by a bank. It is typically linked to a market index or other benchmark. An ETN promises to pay out at maturity the full value of the index, minus management fees.

Bitcoin bulls note this will lead to increased institutional investment into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They say this will, in turn, impact the price positively as more serious money floods into the market.",3/11/2024,0,0.041813828,0.138187677,0.002387769,0.482168138,0.331705987,0.003736587
132,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/06/crypto-market-today.html,CMS,CMS Energy,Cryptocurrencies recover after bitcoin pulls back from new record,"On Tuesday, bitcoin reached a new intraday record , its first since November 2021, at $69,210. It had been pushing higher for weeks — up 55% over the past month — and tumbled shortly after notching the new high.

Bitcoin was last higher by 7.9% at $67,273.54, according to Coin Metrics, while ether soared more than 13% to $3,872.56, its highest level since January 2021.

Cryptocurrencies bounced back on Wednesday, recovering much of the losses from the previous day's sell-off, which came soon after bitcoin hit an all-time high.

""Yesterday seemed like a bullish sharp correction to me, which is fairly typical when you reach a multiyear all-time high,"" said Enclave Markets CEO David Wells.

""There will probably be a second test of the highs, and if we break through that, it could get interesting given the large options positions,"" he added. ""These melt ups include sharp corrections likely related to leveraged long momentum positions taking gains at key levels then getting back in lower.""

As of Wednesday morning, $100 million in short liquidations and $236 million in long liquidations occurred across centralized exchanges over the previous 24 hours, according to CoinGlass.

When traders use leverage to short bitcoin and the cryptocurrency's price rises, they buy bitcoin back from the market to close their positions, which pushes the price up and causes more positions to be liquidated.

""Initially, it looked like this was primarily a spot-driven profit-taking move as open interest in perpetual futures didn't come down, nor did their corresponding funding rates come off,"" said David Duong, head of institutional research at Coinbase. ""But then, the price action caught up to some sizable long liquidations and reset the market. I don't think we'll see another large drop like this in the short-term, barring a major exogenous shock.""

Other crypto coins rebounded with bitcoin and ether. Binance coin surged 12%, while Solana advanced 9.5%. Meme coins were the biggest gainers, with dogecoin up 18% and Shiba Inu coin jumping 21%.

Crypto-related stocks rose, too. Coinbase and Microstrategy gained 10% and 18%, respectively. Cipher Mining surged 27%, while Iris Energy and CleanSpark gained 6% and 8%, respectively. Among the largest miners, Marathon Digital inched higher by 1.6% and Riot Platforms edged lower by 1%.

Seven-time Super Bowl Champion Tom Brady is merging his health and nutrition company, TB12, and his apparel company, Brady, with training brand Nobull.

Next week will spotlight the bulk of the Magnificent Seven names, which had a strong start to the year, but have been in a slump as of late. Tesla reports Tuesday, Meta Platforms is out Wednesday. Thursday serves a double whammy with Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft . But those results are coming at a time when investors are on edge, uncertain where markets are heading after a pushback in rate cut expectations, a recent rise in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, as well as a spike in Treasury yields. On Friday, the S & P 500 was more than 5% off its 52-week high; it also dipped below 5,000, a level the broader index had only reached for the first time ever in February. Wall Street is hoping next week's megacap tech results will give investors insight into where the artificial intelligence trade is going from here, as a bounce in tech could lift the indexes. They're also hoping a slew consumer commentary will give investors insight into the state of the economy. ""Every week of earnings is the most pivotal one, but I really think this one is the most pivotal one,"" said Kim Forrest, founder at Bokeh Capital, adding, ""I think everybody is like me looking to next week thinking, 'This will be the time where we can figure out the direction of the market.'"" On Friday, the S & P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite registered losing weeks. Further gains, or buying opportunity? As a whole, the bar is high for the Magnificent Seven, even as there are increasing divergences between the names. Tesla, for example, will be in the spotlight next week. Investors are hoping for some positive news out of electric vehicle maker, which is the second-worst performer in the S & P 500 this year as it contends with slowing sales and rising competition from China. This week, Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock to hold from buy following a Reuters report of the possible scrapping of a low-cost car. In response, CEO Elon Musk said Reuters was ""lying."" Shares were down 14% this week. Investors a sense of how artificial intelligence will be monetized, seeking insight into growing Google's cloud business , as well as Microsoft's Copilot chatbot. ""These will give us some of the best indications of AI demand,"" said Emily Leveille, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, adding, ""We expect earnings, I think, to be pretty good for at least for Microsoft and for Meta, just considering sort of recent momentum in earnings growth."" Horizon Investments' Scott Ladner urged caution ahead of the reports given the high expectations swirling around the megacaps. However, he said any pullback in the tech names could give investors an opening to start ""nibbling away"" at additional exposure. While the investment chief anticipates further volatility over the next several weeks, he said he anticipates stocks can again rise over the intermediate term, and gain another 10% from here. ""Especially with the AI trade, those expectations have been ramped up. And so, we would probably be a little bit cautious in terms of getting exposure to those names ahead of earnings releases because that bar is quite high,"" Ladner said. ""But if we do get a sell-off associated with those releases that don't hit up on those raised expectations, it probably is, we think, a better buying opportunity than a selling opportunity at that point,"" Ladner added. He also advised investors to start adding exposure to other interesting assets such as in Europe, or in small caps, which could jump after the central bank cuts rates later this year. Consumer focus Wall Street is also anticipating commentary from consumer-facing companies next week that could give insight into the state of the economy. Investors are hoping that consumer spending, which has thus far held up the economy in the face of higher prices, remains robust. Earnings results from Visa, for example, will be on deck. ""From a sentiment standpoint, consumers don't feel very good, but they haven't acted like that for the better part of years,"" Horizon's Ladner said. ""So, the bigger thing that we've been looking for and look for this quarter, is, are the consumers still acting like they're in good shape? Even if they feel a little bit down in the dumps because they don't like the price that they're paying for things, are they are they still paying those prices? Are they still borrowing? Are they still consuming?"" ""So long as that is continues to be the case, which we expect it to be, we think this consumer-facing company is probably going to have a pretty good rebound in the second half of the year,"" Ladner added. On the economic front, next week will also bring the first-quarter gross domestic product number.

135,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/18/netflix-earnings-what-subscriber-reporting-change-means.html,CMCSA,Comcast,Netflix forces Wall Street to focus on profit and revenue with decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers in 2025,"The best way to get investors to stop focusing on something is to stop telling them at all.

Netflix said Thursday it will no longer report quarterly membership numbers and average revenue per membership starting in the first quarter of 2025.

This is a significant change for the company and for the so-called ""streaming wars,"" which have largely been defined by a race for customers. Netflix wants investors to judge the company by the same metrics executives view as ""our best proxy for customer satisfaction,"" the company said in its quarterly shareholder letter.

Namely: revenue, operating margin, free cash flow — and the amount of time spent on Netflix.

It's also a signal Netflix's second wave of subscriber growth may be ending. The company announced it added 9.3 million subscribers in its first quarter as its global password-sharing crackdown and introduction of a less expensive advertising tier took hold. (The ad tier costs $6.99 per month in the U.S. as opposed to its $15.49 standard plan).

Subscriber growth in the second quarter will be lower than in the first quarter due to ""seasonality,"" the company said in the letter. That may be the start of a longer period of slowing subscriber additions, as most freeloading password sharers are now paying customers.

ARM, which Netflix defines as ""streaming revenue divided by the average number of streaming paid memberships divided by the number of months in the period,"" rose just 1% year over year in the quarter.

Netflix shares fell 4% in after-hours trading, in part because of a weaker full-year revenue growth outlook than some analysts estimated. Netflix forecast revenue growth of 16% in the second quarter but just 13% to 15% for the full year.

Investors typically don't like less transparency. It's particularly notable Netflix is cutting back on granular membership information, which the company used to pride itself on — including offering regional breakdowns that were more specific than all of its competitors. Apple and Amazon have never offered quarterly subscriber information for its streaming services.

Still, forcing Wall Street to focus on revenue and profit, rather than user growth, is also evidence of Netflix's maturity as a company. For more than a decade, the streamer has been viewed as a disruptor to legacy media.

Now, about five years into ""the streaming wars,"" Netflix is the dominant incumbent.

""In our early days, when we had little revenue or profit, membership growth was a strong indicator of our future potential,"" Netflix said in its shareholder letter. ""But now we're generating very substantial profit and free cash flow (FCF). We are also developing new revenue streams like advertising and our extra member feature, so memberships are just one component of our growth.""



""In addition, as we've evolved our pricing and plans from a single to multiple tiers with different price points depending on the country, each incremental paid membership has a very different business impact,"" the company added.

Netflix has the luxury of focusing on profit, revenue and free cash flow because the company's finances are far healthier than most legacy media companies. For example, year-over-year revenue climbed 15%.

Operating income grew by 54%, and operating margin rose by 7 percentage points to 28%. These gains far outpace companies such as Warner Bros. Discovery , Disney , Paramount Global and Comcast 's NBCUniversal, which have money-losing (or barely profitable) streaming services and declining traditional TV businesses.

That calls into question whether other media companies will follow Netflix's lead and stop reporting subscriber numbers for their streaming services. Many of the legacy media companies haven't started their password-sharing crackdowns like Netflix. That may mean they have more growth to come, which investors would likely want to see.

""We've evolved and we're going to continue to evolve,"" said Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters during the company's earnings call. ""It means that the historical math we used to do is increasingly less accurate"" in assessing the state of the business, he added.

137,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/04/analyst-calls-all-the-market-moving-chatter-from-wall-street-thursday-morning.html,CMA,Comerica,"Thursday's analyst calls: Apple gets another downgrade, Nike named a top pick","(This is CNBC Pro's live coverage of Thursday's analyst calls and Wall Street chatter. Please refresh every 20-30 minutes to view the latest posts.) Apple seemingly can't catch a break from analysts. On Thursday, Piper Sandler lowered its rating on the tech giant, marking the second major downgrade for the company. Shares are down more than 4% to start the year. On a more positive note, Barclays and Bernstein named Nike a top pick, noting the stock could see a sharp rebound after back-to-back down years. Check out the latest calls and chatter below. 9 a.m. ET: UBS downgrades Pultegroup after big 2023 Investors would be smart to take some of their winnings off the table from one high flying homebuilder, according to UBS. Analyst John Lovallo downgraded Pultegroup to neutral from buy, saying that the stock could struggle relative to its peers. ""Although we remain favorable on the homebuilders in general, we expect PHM's margins/returns to normalize more than peers in '24-'26E which should limit upside to current valuation,"" the note said. Shares of Pulte have gained more than 100% over the past 12 months, but is down about 4% over the past three weeks. Lovallo is still generally positive on homebuilder stocks overall, with D.R. Horton as the UBS top pick in the sector. — Jesse Pound 8:36 a.m. ET: Citi, UBS name FedEx a top pick Analysts at Citi and UBS named FedEx a top pick for 2024 as the freight industry heads for a recovery. ""In the context of earnings power implied by current valuations, we view the parcel space as best positioned near-term,"" wrote Citi's Christian Wetherbee. ""Both FedEx and UPS are trading below average multiples, and both have the potential to see upside to consensus expectations, particularly by C25."" The analyst favors FedEx over UPS , viewing an attractive setup for the company despite the recent ugly quarterly print. The company's ""Tri-Color"" fleet program is likely to lower costs and reduce volatility while opening up an opportunity for $700 million in annual savings by reducing airlift capacity, he wrote. ""Despite disappointing Express results in the 2Q/ Nov. quarter, we continue to believe FDX's large, $4 bn DRIVE cost reduction program supports attractive EPS and upside,"" said UBS analyst Thomas Wadewitz, noting that valuations for the rail and parcel industries look in line with their five-year averages. The cost improvement measures for the company should also situate FedEx for margin improvement, he added. — Samantha Subin 8:34 a.m. ET: UBS names T-Mobile a 2024 top pick T-Mobile is once again UBS's top pick in telecom/cable. Overall, the bank believes the U.S. wireless sector is healthy and that competitive issues are manageable. T-Mobile stands out with its industry-leading financial growth, analyst John Hodulik said. The wireless carrier should also see continued momentum in subscriber trends and its significant buyback capacity should fuel free-cash-flow per share growth, Hodulik said. — Michelle Fox 8:07 a.m. ET: Comerica upgraded to buy at Goldman Sachs on regional bank optimism Goldman Sachs upgraded Comerica to buy from neutral, with the firm looking ahead to a more constructive year for regional bank stocks after their 2023 crisis. ""We believe we are now on a path of ""reverting to normal"" where EPS should bottom near-term and earnings power should begin to improve,"" in regional bank stocks, analyst Ryan Nash wrote in a Thursday note. Improvement should start in the second half of 2024, he said, as the Federal Reserve eases interest rates and banks should see ""meaningful"" growth in their tangible book value. Nash expects Comerica's shares to be worth $70 over time. If shares reach that number, it would indicate about 28% potential upside from Wednesday's close. The stock was trading 1.8% higher in premarket trading Thursday. According to the firm, catalysts for Comerica over 2024 include: Net interest income should start to inflect as deposit pressure eases and Comerica benefits from interest rate cuts. Loan growth should return as middle market clients start to ""borrow incrementally,"" Nash said. Expenses should be less of a headwind given the move in long-term rates. Tangle book value, which is down 43% from the peak according to Nash, could grow 27% in the fourth quarter of 2023 and another roughly 18% over the course of 2023. — Pia Singh 8 a.m. ET: Wolfe Research upgrades GM, backs away from Rivian 2024 could be a year where a legacy automaker flexes its financial muscle, at least compared to the less proven electric vehicle companies, according to Wolfe Research. Analyst Rod Lache upgraded GM to outperform on Thursday, while downgrading Rivian to peer perform. The bullishness on GM is due to the company's ability to cut costs and its stock buyback program. ""We believe that investors underestimate the earnings and cash flow power that GM will generate over the near- to medium-term, and the competitive cost advantages that they are bringing to bear over the medium- to longer-term. Based on GM's cash deployment strategy (GM is buying back 25% of their outstanding shares over the next 12-months, and they could potentially buy an additional 20% over the subsequent 12 months), we see it as relatively less likely that shares remain at current levels,"" Lache said in a note to clients. For Rivian , however, the company's true breakthrough is still a few years away, according to Lache. ""We continue to believe in RIVN's long-term strategy. And we've been encouraged by their (recently) strong production and cost execution. But for the Street to look further out to the launch of their R2 platform (in 2026), we believe that Investors will need more insight into demand for the company's R1 platform (which has to carry them through 2024 and 2025),"" the note said. — Jesse Pound 7:49 a.m. ET: There are three reasons to buy Truist, Bank of America says in upgrade Bank of America thinks it's time to get into Truist Financial , upgrading the stock to buy from neutral on Thursday. Analyst Ebrahim Poonawala pointed to three reasons for the call, including Truist's balance sheet positioning heading into the Federal Reserve's rate cut cycle. Truist has also sharpened its focus on franchise efficiency, he wrote in a note to clients. ""We see potential for management to outperform on cost save targets on the back of the recently announced organizational simplification (= enhanced productivity) and as management synergizes its merger-of -equals (MOE) between SunTrust/BB & T,"" he said. Lastly, he sees superior growth potential thanks to its footprint in the Southeast and capital optionality stemming from the possible sale of its remaining stake in its insurance business. — Michelle Fox 7:06 a.m. ET: Roth MKM downgrades Mattel, cites cautious 2024 outlook Roth MKM downgraded shares of Mattel to neutral, citing a cautious outlook for 2024. ""In our view, Mattel finished 2023 with excess inventory on retail shelves which will once again weigh on 1H results (although to a lesser extent than 2023),"" wrote analyst Eric Handler, adding that expectations look too high. While the company may have gained shelf space in retail stores, many inventories for certain brands – including Barbie and Hot Wheels – appeared elevated at the end of the quarter, meaning the company will need time to work down the excess. To be sure, the firm views Mattel as a solid company with a ""valuable brand portfolio."" However, expectations for lower growth create an unfavorable risk-reward for the stock at present. ""Given the likely prospects of lower than expected reorder rates in 1H, challenging comparisons arising from economic participation associated with the Barbie movie, and a lack of major product introductions or consequential movie tie-ins, we are now anticipating a low growth year for the business,"" he said. Handler trimmed his price target to $20 from $24 a share, implying about 9% upside from Wednesday's close. The stock lost 1% during premarket trading. — Samantha Subin 6:49 a.m. ET: Morgan Stanley upgrades Allstate, calls insurance stock an 'underappreciated story' Morgan Stanley is turning more bullish on shares of Allstate in the new year, calling the insurance company an ""underappreciated story in a favorable market environment."" Analyst Bob Jian Huang upgraded the company to overweight from equal weight, citing higher personal auto-growth and lower underwriting losses, which he expects to power better earnings growth in 2024. ""As we head into 2024, lower inflationary pressure and continued strong pricing lead us to believe that the overall environment should turn more positive for Allstate,"" he said. The stock rose less than 1% before the bell, with the firm's adjusted $171 price target suggesting another 18% upside from Wednesday's close. ALL 1Y mountain ALL in past year The analyst also views the company's valuation as attractive relative to peer Progressive and offers a favorable risk-reward trading at 8. 8 times 2025 earnings. Favorable cyclical factors including higher pricing and policy-in-force growth, coupled with a better underwriting margin setup as inflationary pressures ease, should also benefit Allstate, he added. ""Among the personal auto carriers, we believe Allstate and Progressive are both well positioned for growth (albeit from different levels),"" Huang said. ""As such, we expect the ~3% PIF growth will position Allstate to take market share at the expense of more stagnant carriers."" — Samantha Subin 6:35 a.m. ET: Oppenheimer downgrades PayPal, cites 'profitability pressure' Oppenheimer downgraded PayPal to perform from outperform as the payments company faces ""persistent profitability pressure."" ""A mix from branded to unbranded volumes is impacting their ability to stabilize [gross profit] margins and thus operating margins outside of expense cuts,"" wrote Dominick Gabriele. ""As expenses continue to get cut, PYPL could fall behind peers in innovation. It will likely take multiple years for PYPL's profitability to stabilize."" The mix between branded and unbranded volumes also seems to suggest that PayPal's transaction margin is headed lower and likely to weigh on profitability and the company's ability to expand its price-to-earnings multiple in the near term, Gabriele wrote. ""We see better opportunity in medium-term value creation with limited transition headaches and better downside EPS protection at peers,"" he said. — Samantha Subin 6:16 a.m. ET: JPMorgan upgrades American Express JPMorgan upgraded shares of American Express to overweight from neutral, viewing the credit card issuer as a ""safe haven"" from weak household balance sheets. ""We believe lower/middle income borrowers are facing pressure from depleted pandemic savings and the lingering effects of high inflation, and expect AXP to offer investors shelter from these forces,"" said Richard Shane in a Thursday note to clients. ""Following a year end rally, price appreciation is likely to follow EPS growth (10-12%) rather than be driven by multiple expansion."" Within the past two calendar years American Express has also conveyed the ""power of its business model"" and showed resilient credit performance even as white-collar professions grappled with layoffs, he added. In the near future, Shane views uncertainty around the final Basel III ruling, and whether persistent higher-income spending can continue as key issues for American Express. JPMorgan also lifted its price target to $205 a share, which represents 10% upside from Wednesday's close. Elsewhere, Shane downgraded Capital One Financial to neutral from overweight, citing expectations for a limited multiple expansion and its recent rally on positive credit commentary. ""COF has greater exposure to nonprime borrowers, and given our concerns about depleted pandemic savings and the lingering effects of inflation on low income households, we see better risk/reward elsewhere in our coverage,"" he wrote. – Samantha Subin 6:09 a.m. ET: Bernstein downgrades Analog Devices, says company needs to 'grow' into new multiple Bernstein is moving to the sidelines on shares of Analog Devices in the new year as the company grows into its heightened multiple. Analyst Stacy Rasgon downgraded the company to market perform from outperform, citing valuation concerns as the analog industry faces its reset. ""We think the story gets a little murkier in analog-land,"" he said in a Thursday note to clients. ""On the one hand numbers have been cut (in some cases substantially), but many of those cuts have already been aggressively bought, and some of the stocks may need time to grow into multiples."" Within the analog and large-cap semiconductor space, the company's experienced one of the steepest estimate revisions, while consensus expectations sit down a third from their 2023 peak, Rasgon noted. At the same time, Analog's multiple has climbed nearly 50% and looks elevated in the high 20s – even for a ""high-quality"" company. ""That being said, while a high-20's multiple isn't crazy to put on a trough earnings, it seems likely to us that those earnings will probably have to grow into the multiple, and the stock itself may trade sideways for a bit until then, and there may be better places to put new money to work in the space for now,"" he wrote. The firm's unchanged $200 price target suggests about 6% upside from Wednesday's close. — Samantha Subin 5:43 a.m. ET: Piper Sandler downgrades Apple, cites valuation and handset concerns Piper Sandler is turning more cautious on Apple in 2024. Analyst Harsh Kumar downgraded shares of the iPhone maker to neutral from overweight, citing valuation concerns, macro weakness and a strained handset outlook. ""We are concerned about handset inventories entering into 1H24 and also feel that growth rates have peaked for unit Sales,"" he wrote. The setup for handset companies looks murky in the first half of 2024 following a slowdown in 2023, with a recovery unlikely until the back half of the year, Kumar wrote, adding that a weakening macro environment in China could also further weigh on this business. The difficult handset setup also led Kumar to downgrade both Qorvo and Skyworks Solutions. More negative news surrounding the company's Apple Watch, at the center of an intellectual property dispute with medical technology company Masimo, and other legal battles, could also pose headwinds in the new year, he added. ""Difficult comps from 2023 paired with constant currency headwinds are expected to continue in 1H24 with interest rates remaining elevated,"" he added. Apple shares lagged behind megacap peers in 2023 but rallied 48%. According to Kumar, Apple's valuation already looks high, trading above a five-year historical price-to-earnings ratio of 24 times at 29 times earnings on a next twelve-month basis. Given this outlook, Kumar trimmed the firm's price target to $205 from $220 a share, representing 11% upside from Wednesday's close. Shares lost 0.7% before the bell. This is the second major downgrade Apple has received this week. On Tuesday, Barclays lowered its rating on the tech giant to underweight from equal weight. — Samantha Subin 5:42 a.m. ET: Barclays and Bernstein name Nike a top pick After back-to-back losing years, Barclays and Bernstein think it's time for Nike to turn around. Both firms named the apparel giant a top pick. Barclays analyst Adrienne Yih rates the stock as overweight with a price target of $142, which implies upside of 36.5%. Bernstein's Aneesha Sherman has an outperform rating on shares with a $134, pointing to a 29% gain. Barclays' Yih pointed to wholesale recover and improving margins as catalysts for the stock in 2024. ""Our 2024 best idea recommendation is based on: 1) continued and accelerating positive sales-to-inventory growth; 2) improved product margins accelerating on lower costs; 3) expected wholesale 'bottom' in FY2Q24; and 4) new innovation cycle that will be more impactful in FY25 and beyond,"" the analyst said. Sherman from Bernstein, meanwhile, thinks Nike's fiscal 2025 estimates are down too much. ""Consensus seems to have extrapolated the weak H2 guidance to underwrite demand weakness through the entire following fiscal year as well. This is an overreaction,"" Sherman said. ""The H2 guidance cut was more indicative of current market conditions and retailer timidness in 2024 order books ... than of Nike's fundamental viability as a brand."" Nike shares posted their second straight annual decline in 2023, losing 7.2%. This comes after a 29.8% drop in 2022.

A highly popular group of weight loss and diabetes drugs is decreasing some consumers' appetites — and also how much they spend on food. Most people taking those medications, called GLP-1s, say they are spending less on eating out at restaurants and ordering takeout, according to a Morgan Stanley survey released on Tuesday. A smaller share of those surveyed say they are tightening their purse strings in the grocery store. The findings add to the mounting concerns that soaring demand for GLP-1s could take a bite out of the bottom lines of some of the biggest restaurant companies and makers of packaged snacks like Doritos, Oreos and Hershey's Kisses. GLP-1s include Novo Nordisk 's blockbuster weight loss injection Wegovy and diabetes counterpart Ozempic, along with Eli Lilly 's popular weight loss treatment Zepbound and diabetes injection Mounjaro. The rising demand for these four drugs isn't expected to ease anytime soon. In the new survey, Morgan Stanley analysts said they expect the market for GLP-1s to be worth $105 billion by 2030. They also estimate that 31.5 million people, or around 9% of the U.S. population, will take GLP-1s by 2035. ""There is growing evidence that the drugs have a meaningful impact on consumer behavior and spending on groceries and restaurants,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said in the survey. ""All of these dynamics suggest GLP-1 drugs' impact across consumer sectors is set to increase as drug uptake grows and the drugs reshape behavior among a demographic group that represents a disproportionate share of calorie consumption.""

Morgan Stanley conducted the survey of 300 consumers who are currently taking GLP-1 drugs in February. Those people are ""early in their weight loss journey,"" but are making substantial changes to their diets and spending, according to the firm. When asked to gauge how their monthly spending on eating out at restaurants has changed since starting a GLP-1, 63% of the consumers said they are spending less, 28% said they are spending about the same amount, and 9% said they are spending more. Meanwhile, 61% said they are spending less on deliveries or takeout from restaurants, 31% said they are spending around the same amount and 8% said they are spending more. Fewer participants said they lowered their grocery spending since they started a GLP-1: 31% said they are spending less, 46% said they are spending around the same amount and 23% said they are spending more. The survey also found that people tended to stick with the same restaurant but changed the kinds of meals they ordered. When asked whether they finish less of the food they order in one sitting when dining out, 42% of participants said ""always"" or ""most of the time,"" and 44% said ""occasionally."" Forty-one percent said they are ""always"" or ""most of the time"" ordering smaller portions of food overall, while 43% said they are only sometimes doing that. Consumers in the survey reported reduced food consumption across the board, but the difference is most notable on snacks, confections, carbonated and sugary drinks and alcohol, according to the Morgan Stanley survery. Roughly half of people reported cutting consumption of regular sodas, alcohol and salty snacks by 50% or more since starting on weight loss drugs. Twenty-two percent reported stopping alcohol consumption entirely.",4/20/2024,-2,0.000587365,0.997601092,0.000591386,0.000584883,0.00027677,0.000358495

Here is Jim Cramer's remedy,"Every weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer releases the Homestretch — an actionable afternoon update, just in time for the last hour of trading on Wall Street. (We're no longer recording the audio, so we can get this new written feature to members as quickly as possible.) Markets drop: There was another attempt to lift the market at the beginning of Friday's session, but it failed once again, putting the S & P 500 on track for a six-day losing streak. We keep pointing out that the rallies are happening too early in the session, leading the initial buyers to get caught by scalpers looking to make a quick trade. Volatile markets like this are when patience matters. We're still waiting for that truly ugly open before stepping up our buys. Until we see that crescendo, the oversold market means stay opportunistic but be gradual. That's been our approach this week, with our most-recent trade being a small buy of Estee Lauder on Thursday morning. Bad week for tech : Tech is getting hit hard again Friday, capping off a week in which the Nasdaq 100 fell by more than 5%. The biggest drag in the sector, by far, is Super Micro Computer . Shares of the artificial intelligence server maker were down as much as 20% Friday for a reason you don't see too often: The company hasn't preannounced earnings yet. Super Micro's stock has been one of the biggest winners in the market over the past couple of years due to the rapid construction of data centers around the world. Heavy investments in AI accelerated this trend. As demand for its rack-scale solutions and liquid-cooled systems surged, Super Micro's quarters kept getting better and better, resulting in earnings preannouncements in seven of the past eight quarters, including in January. Last month, the stock was added to the S & P 500. Entering this week, Super Micro was up more than 200% year to date. With earnings getting close on April 30, the fact Super Micro has yet to give a positive preannouncement is being viewed as negative, according to analysts at Wells Fargo. That doesn't mean Super Micro's quarter won't be good — we can't possibly know. But the recent fall in SMCI on no actual announcement is a reminder of a lesson that we shared earlier this year when markets were steadily making new highs: Always be fearful of parabolic moves and make sure you are taking gains on the way up because those kinds of moves are unstainable. Pockets of green: It's not all negative Friday. There's some pretty good strength in energy stocks, financials, consumer staples, health care, and real estate — a sign of money rotating out of hot momentum names and into other areas in the market. Shares of Club holding Coterra Energy rose nearly 2% on Friday, among the best performers in the portfolio. Do the work: Wells Fargo made a new 52-week high Friday, extending its weekly gains to more than 7%. Wells Fargo's strength follows a negative reaction to its first-quarter earnings report last week , even though the results were quite good. That's a theme we've noticed so far this earnings season. There's so much information coming out that sometimes the market gets sloppy and focuses on the wrong things, leading to misread results and ridiculous stock reactions. Fellow Club holdings Constellation Brands and Abbott Laboratories belong in this group, too. The lesson? Don't let the tape be the judge of a quarter. Instead, read the earnings materials and conference calls yourself because doing the work will help you spot opportunities. ""It's important to have confidence in investing. But confidence comes from doing the homework,"" Jim Cramer said Friday. Next week: Rest up over the weekend for an earnings barrage. Roughly 30% of the S & P 500 and 11 Dow components report earnings next week. Among the headliners are a trio of portfolio stocks — Alphabet , Microsoft and Meta Platforms — and beaten-up Tesla . But there are plenty of other big reports to sink our teeth into. Club holdings Danaher , Ford Motor , and Honeywell International are scheduled to report along with Verizon , Cadence Design , Nucor , UPS , GE Aerospace , PepsiCo, RTX , Halliburton , Thermo Fisher Scientific , ServiceNow and Chipotle , among others. Check your email inboxes and texts Saturday morning for a breakdown on what we're expecting from the six Club stocks set to report this coming week.

Peloton — Shares of the fitness company provider jumped 3.8% on Friday, a day after Peloton announced that it is partnering with TikTok to bring short-form fitness videos to the social media platform. The partnership is an effort to boost subscribers and attract a wider pool of customers, as Peloton attempts to recover from falling sales and profits. Palantir Technologies — Shares slid 3.7% after Jefferies said Palantir's artificial intelligence advantage has been overhyped in the near-term and that the stock has soared to ""unsustainable valuation levels."" The firm downgraded Palantir to underperform from hold. Okta — The cybersecurity stock slumped 1.5% after Jefferies downgraded Okta to hold from buy on Friday, citing a recent security breach as added pressure on the company. Costco Wholesale — Shares of the retail giant rose nearly 1% after Costco said Thursday that December sales jumped 9.9% year-over-year to $26.15 billion, fueled by its e-commerce segment. Costco's total and comparable sales saw a 3% benefit from December's additional shopping day due to the timing of New Year's Day, the company said. Constellation Brands — The beer, wine and liquor company reported third-quarter revenue of $2.47 billion, falling short of the $2.54 billion expected from analysts surveyed by LSEG. However, adjusted earnings per share came in at $3.19, topping the $3 expected. Shares slipped less than 1%. Tesla — The electric vehicle maker dipped 0.7% after China's State Administration for Market Regulation said Tesla is recalling more than 1.6 million of its EVs in China due to problems with door latch and autosteering functions. Tesla received an overweight rating from Piper Sandler on Thursday, however, on confidence that the company can outperform its peers thanks to its vertical integration. Medical Properties Trust — The real estate investment trust plunged 20.4% after it announced Thursday that it is working with Steward Health Care System, its largest tenant, to devise a strategy that allows it to strengthen its liquidity and recover about $50 million in unpaid rent. — CNBC's Michelle Fox Theobald contributed reporting.",1/5/2024,0,0.027237197,0.914824843,0.002349005,0.034749806,0.018409081,0.002429935

The producer and consumer price indexes released this week showed annualized inflation still above 2%, a worrisome sign for investors hoping that the Federal Reserve could soon begin lowering interest rates. Now, fed funds futures pricing data suggests that the first rate cut could come as late as September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. Those fears have contributed to a pullback in the market, with the S & P 500 slipping around 1% since the start of April. Still, the benchmark index has climbed 9% since the start of 2024. Investors could consider rotating into more defensively focused names to prepare for market volatility. On this front, CNBC Pro's screener tool offers some ideas. To find these names, CNBC Pro looked for S & P 500 stocks that meet the following criteria: Beta under 1, meaning these names are less volatile than the market Net income compound annual growth rate of 20% or more over past three years Gross margins of 30% or more Upside to the average analyst's price target of at least 10% Of the hundreds of stocks in the index, just four check all of these boxes.

Amid a period defined by artificial intelligence and technology's outperformance, ServiceNow and Roper Technologies offer investors a way to both play defensive while staying exposed to the sector. ServiceNow has performed around in line with the Nasdaq Composite this year, with a gain of less than 10%. Of the 41 analysts covering the stock, 38 rate it a buy or strong buy, and the consensus average price target implies more than 10% in upside ahead for the software stock, according to LSEG. Roper, on the other hand, has struggled this year, with the software stock's shares falling slightly in 2024. But analysts see a rebound on the horizon, with the typical one polled by LSEG having a buy rating with a price target reflecting a rally of more than 10%. The stock also has a dividend yield of 0.6%. NOW ROP YTD mountain ServiceNow vs. Roper, year to date Outside of technology, TJX also made the list. The parent of T.J.

(We're no longer recording the audio, so we can get this new written feature to members as quickly as possible.) Markets: Stocks were slightly lower Monday in what has been a rather calm session. The sluggish start follows a powerful rally last week that sent the S & P 500 , Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite to record high closes, before a down Friday. Energy's Comeback: The tech sector dominates the Wall Street conversation because carries the largest weighting in the S & P 500 and the artificial intelligence trade has captured everyone's attention. But did you know energy has been the top-performing sector in March? The rally this month comes alongside roughly $3-per-barrel rally in the price of oil, while natural gas has slipped back. In Monday's session, specifically, energy also was the top S & P 500 sector. ""Glad Coterra Energy emphasized oil, which keeps going higher and de-emphasized natural gas,"" Jim Cramer said, referring to the Club holding that maintains sizable production businesses for both commodities. With its fourth quarter 2023 earnings report, Coterra announced plans to shift some of its capital investment toward more oil production instead of natural gas, given depressed prices for the latter. Shares of Coterra are up about 8% in March, among the best-performing Club holdings. New highs list: There's lone stock in the portfolio making a new 52-week high Monday is Disney . Shares of the media-and-entertainment giant is benefitting from longtime bear Barclays upgrading the stock to a buy-equivalent rating with a $135 price target. Barclays got more bullish on Disney on the view that management's turnaround strategy will have a greater impact on earnings starting next year. ""The pressure on Disney from [activist investor Nelson Peltz] is really causing this company to concentrate and be more credible,"" Jim said. Other tidbits: The ""Magnificent Seven"" is off to a slow start to the week, but Club name Nvidia is bucking the trend up nearly 2%. ""Nvidia has so many orders that I think you can see why it is going higher,"" Jim said. ""That was the gist of last week: orders,"" added Jim, who spent last week at Nvidia's GTC conference in California. In Jim's Sunday column , he discussed all the companies partnering with Nvidia and which ones he thinks stand to gain the most. Ford Motor 's renewed emphasis on profitable internal combustion engine and hybrid vehicles is a big reason why the stock has outperformed electric vehicle pure plays. On Monday, Mizuho downgraded its rating on Tesla, Rivian Automotive, and Nio, citing concerns about near term EV demand and tightening liquidity. ""It's time for Ford to break out,"" Jim said. ""It is so heavy ICE and hybrid that it is just a little push to $13 to get this thing rolling."" Shares of Ford were roughly flat Monday, around $12.90 each. We increased our price target to Eaton Corp. to $330 a share on Friday, and then over the weekend we read some interesting journalism that goes to the heart of our investment thesis in the company. ""There's a piece in the Wall Street Journal about how AI data centers will consume so much power that it could overwhelm the grid. Think Eaton,"" Jim said. Up next: It may be a slower news week since this we are in the last few days of the first quarter.

149,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/24/natural-gas-prices-are-struggling-what-it-means-for-coterra-energy.html,CTRA,Coterra,Why natural gas prices are so volatile — and what it means for our lone energy stock,"Natural gas prices have had an up and down January — taking Club stock Coterra Energy along for the wild ride. After rising more than 30% over the first two weeks of the year, natural gas futures plunged 24% last week and have continued their fall in recent days. The commodity lost 4% on Monday, but in a volatile session Tuesday settled up 1.3%, at $2.45 per million British thermal units. Nevertheless, nat gas prices remained negative year to date. Early Wednesday, nat gas prices swung higher. Shares of Coterra – whose total revenue is split evenly between natural gas and crude oil – gained ground Tuesday to more than $24 each, putting year-to-date declines at less than 3.5%. That performance has been marginally worse than the S & P 500 energy sector over the same stretch. Meanwhile, the broad S & P 500 index has risen roughly 2% in 2024. CTRA .SPX 1M mountain Coterra Energy's stock price over the past month compared with the S & P 500. Despite some seeing a challenging near-term picture for natural gas prices, our investment outlook on Coterra and the energy sector more broadly remains the same. In a diversified portfolio, it's worth owning an oil-and-gas stock, partly as a hedge in case there's a dramatic spike in energy prices, as there was in early 2022 after Russia invaded Ukraine. At this point, Coterra is our company of choice due to its significant exposure to both natural gas and oil, giving it flexibility on production, along with its internal improvements on well productivity to aid profitability — the latter being called out in multiple Wall Street analyst upgrades of the stock in recent weeks. Additionally, the company is committed to returning excess cash to shareholders, with a wise preference on buybacks over variable dividend payouts. It also stands to gain from the expected increases in U.S. liquified natural gas export capacity beginning primarily in 2025. Still, volatile oil and natural gas prices hold sway over Coterra's near-term stock moves. And the swift reversal of fortunes for natural gas has been hard to ignore. However, some context is necessary when analyzing the swing. ""Last week's meltdown appears so significant because the move higher was, really, from a fundamental perspective completely overdone,"" said Eli Rubin, a natural gas analyst at EBW Analytics Group. The commodity was particularly beaten up to end 2023, Rubin said, after one of the warmest Decembers on record limited demand for natural gas to heat homes and other buildings. The warm December added insult to injury amid strong U.S. natural gas production and mild weather throughout the fall, contributing to an oversupplied market. The result is traders had grown quite bearish on natural gas, Rubin said, which created the technical conditions for a dramatic spike in prices if more positive fundamental signs emerged. And they did, in fact, emerge by way of winter storms and bitter-cold temperatures that swept large parts of the U.S., causing a surge in demand for natural gas. That technical and fundamental backdrop created the jump of more than 30% in natural gas prices. However, the market's focus last week began to shift toward weather forecasts for later in the month, which point to a return of warmer temperatures. And that's generally what sparked the big decline in natural gas prices that have persisted into this week, Rubin said. Over the next three to six months, Rubin said he expects the natural gas market to remain ""vastly oversupplied,"" suggesting more pressure on the commodity's price could be on the horizon. But looking out further on the horizon, Rubin said he sees the outlook starting to brighten as LNG-related demand is set to appear and hopes for a more normal winter emerge. That should bode well for Coterra. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long CTRA. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

150,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/05/jim-cramer-sees-two-paths-ahead-for-coterra-energy.html,CTRA,Coterra,Our only energy stock scores another big Wall Street upgrade. We see two paths ahead,"Another Wall Street analyst has thrown their support behind Coterra Energy , adding to Jim Cramer's belief that the oil and gas producer is a stock to watch in the new year. Bank of America on Friday upgraded Coterra to buy from a hold-equivalent rating, becoming the fourth research firm in less than a month to turn positive on the Club holding. Within a few days of each other in December, Citi, UBS and Wells Fargo all recommended clients buy Coterra . More than 60% of analysts covering Coterra now have a buy-equivalent rating on the stock, according to FactSet. ""I think Coterra is either going to get bought [by another company] or have a huge year because there are too many people who are behind for me to think there's just, like, 'Well, let's buy it for no reason,'"" Jim said Friday. ""People just feel like this is the year they can have the breakout."" Coterra on Friday rose nearly 1% to just over $25 per share as the Club considers whether to buy more of the stock. Both oil and natural gas were up on the session. Our most recent Coterra purchase came Dec. 6 — just $25 per share, as investors dumped the stock aggressively during what proved to be a five-day losing streak. Coterra has underperformed the S & P 500 over the past six months, gaining about 1.6% compared with a nearly 6% gain for the broad U.S. stock index. The S & P 500 Energy Sector was up about 4% over the same stretch. CTRA .SPX 6M mountain Coterra versus S & P 500 over the past six months While there's no public indication that Coterra could be imminently acquired, Jim's comments reflect an awareness of the flurry of dealmaking across the energy sector in the wake of ExxonMobil 's $60 billion takeover of Pioneer Natural Resources . Weeks later, Exxon's rival oil major Chevron in October announced a plan to buy Hess for $53 billion. Meanwhile, smaller deals — such as Occidental Petroleum 's $12 billion bid for privately held CrownRock — also have transpired. The latest consolidation move came on Thursday when Apache parent APA said it planned to buy Callon Petroleum for $4.5 billion. Volatile oil and natural gas prices remain an important driver of Coterra's stock. Coterra's revenues are split roughly 50-50 between oil and natural gas. In general, the higher the commodities trade, the more money Coterra will eventually have left over to return to shareholders through stock buybacks — and, to a lesser extent, dividend payouts. Investors in the energy patch, including us at the Club, care deeply about capital returns. @CL.1 @NG.1 6M mountain Oil versus natural gas over the past six months Crude prices have been in the low-to-mid $70s per barrel since early December, a far cry from the more-than-$90 a barrel levels seen in late September. However, mounting tensions in the Middle East — amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and, more recently, shipping attacks in the Red Sea — have emerged as a key factor that could push oil higher. After falling by more than a third between the start of November and mid-December, natural gas prices have started to drift higher. On Friday, U.S. natural gas traded around $2.84 per million British thermal units, up about 20% from its recent low on Dec. 12. A warm winter so far in the Northern Hemisphere has crimped demand for natural gas needed to heat homes and other buildings, weighing on the commodity's price. To be sure, investors in exploration-and-production companies like Coterra pay attention to more than just the day-to-day fluctuations in crude and natural gas prices. Analysts, including those at Bank of America, have touted Coterra's improving well productivity as a reason to like the stock. In its upgrade, Bofa also said Coterra's strong balance sheet is a positive differentiator, making the stock a bit more defensive compared to oil-and-gas-producing peers who carry higher debt loads. Cost savings for Coterra's drilling operations could prove to be another tailwind for its stock this year. The company has estimated about 5% deflation in 2024, which, if it comes to pass, could help keep capital expenditures restrained, leaving more money available to return to shareholders. The eventual refilling of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which the Biden administration drained to combat surging energy prices tied to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and the rise in liquified natural gas exports expected in 2025 represent two additional long-term factors to consider.

151,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/04/the-rally-in-oil-cannot-be-ignored-heres-what-it-means-for-stock-market-investors.html,CTRA,Coterra,The rally in oil cannot be ignored — here's what it means for stock market investors,"U.S. oil prices have climbed to their highest level since late October, as the rally in the key commodity becomes something equity investors cannot afford to look past. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose modestly Wednesday and at one point breached $86 a barrel, bringing the U.S. oil benchmark's year-to-date gain to 19%. Brent crude also climbed Wednesday and nearly eclipsed $90 a barrel. The global oil standard is up about 16% in 2024. Meanwhile, shares of Coterra Energy , our lone oil-and-gas holding, are up about 9% over the past month, among the top-performing portfolio stocks in that timeframe. Energy has been by far the best S & P 500 sector during the same stretch, jumping more than 12% compared with a roughly 1.7% gain for the index. The latest news driving Wednesday's gains for oil: The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and a group of partner producers led by Russia, together known as OPEC+, does not plan to change its output policy . OPEC+ last month agreed to extend its 2.2 million barrels per day output reduction until the end of the second quarter in an effort to support prices. Outside of the cartel's policy, the multiweek rally for crude has been driven by positive demand updates and concerns about supply amid mounting tensions in the Middle East. The much-better-than-expected ISM Manufacturing PMI reading released Monday — 50.3 versus 48.1 expected — was a significant development for the oil market for multiple reasons. Not only was it stronger than anticipated, but it was on the right side of 50, indicating that U.S. manufacturing activity expanded for the first time since September 2022. Moreover, in a commentary section of the ISM report, many respondents indicated they expected to see activity pick up into the back half of the year. In other words, the latest ISM Manufacturing report serves to support the view that the U.S. economy is doing much better than many believed it would just a few months ago. A separate report this week also painted a positive picture about manufacturing activity and business confidence in China, the world's second-largest economy and a huge buyer of oil. The supply side of the oil equation is being challenged by more than just OPEC+. The ongoing war between Russia, a major oil producer, and Ukraine remains a risk; on Tuesday, Ukrainian drone strikes hit a Russian oil refinery , though Reuters reported that damage to the facility is not significant, citing an unnamed industry source. There also is added geopolitical risk premium resulting from Israel's decision to strike part of an Iranian embassy complex in Syria — a move that Iran, a top 10 global oil producer, has vowed to respond to . Oil trading at its highest levels since late October has implications for stock market investors. As Jim Cramer said during Wednesday's Morning Meeting, we can't have our head in the sand about the climb in crude. For starters, it means the Federal Reserve is right to keep rates where they are. If energy prices remain around these levels, or go even higher, that's an elevated input cost for companies that serves to pressure profit margins. If companies can't mitigate the cost of energy through cost cuts elsewhere, they may look to raise prices on their products. That is exactly what the Fed does not want to see. Indeed, ""oil is fighting the Fed, again,"" Bank of America commodities strategists wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. We also need to monitor employment trends and wage inflation that much more closely. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation may be the core personal consumption expenditures price index, which removes the impact of food and energy prices, but consumers still pay for energy. It's a very material, largely unavoidable cost, especially as the weather warms and we get into the summer driving months. The rise in energy prices — particularly at the gas pump — can result in a decrease of discretionary dollars left for other purchases. Fortunately, in a sign of labor market strength, the ADP's private payroll report for the month of March came in stronger than expected Wednesday, with wages up 5.1% for workers who stayed in their jobs. The next big watch item on this front will be Friday's March nonfarm payroll report. For now, the bottom line is the increase in oil prices is not great from a cost perspective for corporations or consumers — but the negative must also be balanced out by the fact that economic strength is one factor driving the rise. U.S. unemployment remains low and wages are now rising faster than inflation. With first-quarter earnings season kicking off in earnest next week with bank reports and ramping up from there, we'll be listening closely to see how companies are feeling and responding to the increase in energy prices.

Medicare can start covering certain weight loss drugs for the first time — as long as they are approved for an added health benefit, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said Thursday.

That opens the door for broader coverage of some highly popular weight loss medications such as Novo Nordisk 's Wegovy, which is now approved in the U.S. for heart health. Those treatments have skyrocketed in demand over the past year despite their hefty price tags and spotty insurance coverage.

Under the new CMS guidance, Medicare Part D plans can cover obesity treatments that receive Food and Drug Administration approval for an additional health benefit. Medicare prescription drug plans administered by private insurers, known as Part D, currently cannot cover those drugs for weight loss alone.

The agency's guidance means Medicare patients could soon get coverage for Wegovy, as long as they have obesity and a history of heart disease and are prescribed the treatment to reduce their risk of heart attacks and strokes. Earlier this month, the Food and Drug Administration approved Wegovy for that purpose.

The guidance also will open the door to future coverage of other weight loss medications, many of which are being tested for additional health conditions.

Drugmakers such as Novo Nordisk, which also makes the diabetes drug Ozempic, and Eli Lilly are studying their weight loss medicines as treatments for fatty liver disease, chronic kidney disease, sleep apnea and more. To be covered, those drugs would need to return late-stage trial results and then be submitted for FDA approval for those uses.

Wegovy is part of a class of drugs called GLP-1s which mimic a hormone produced in the gut to suppress a person's appetite and help regulate blood sugar. Coverage for those treatments when used for weight loss is a mixed bag.

Roughly 110 million American adults are living with obesity and approximately 50 million of them have insurance coverage for weight loss drugs, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk said in a statement last week.

Some of the nation's largest insurers, such as CVS Health's Aetna, also cover the treatments.

But many employers don't. An October survey of more than 200 companies by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, or IFEBP, found only 27% provided coverage for GLP-1s for weight loss, compared with the 76% that covered those drugs for diabetes. Notably, 13% of employers indicated they were considering coverage for weight loss.

A provision of a 2003 law established that Medicare Part D plans can't cover drugs used for weight loss, but the program does cover obesity screening, behavioral counseling and bariatric surgery. A group of bipartisan lawmakers have introduced legislation that would eliminate the provision, but its fate in Congress is far from certain.

A CMS spokesperson told CNBC last week that Medicaid programs would be required to cover Wegovy specifically for its new cardiovascular use. By law, Medicaid must cover nearly all FDA-approved medications, but weight loss treatments are among a small group of drugs that can be excluded from coverage. Around 1 in 5 state Medicaid programs currently cover GLP-1 drugs for weight loss.",3/21/2024,0,0.000862049,0.995028675,0.000847945,0.002073976,0.000701285,0.000485939

CVS and Walgreens will start selling the abortion pill mifepristone this month at certain pharmacy locations in states where it is legal to do so, spokespeople for the companies told CNBC on Friday.

CVS and Walgreens received certification from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to dispense the commonly used pill at their retail pharmacies, spokespeople for each company said in separate statements.

CVS will begin filling prescriptions for the medication in Massachusetts and Rhode Island in the coming weeks, a spokesperson for the company said. They added that CVS will expand to additional states, ""where allowed by law, on a rolling basis.""

Walgreens expects to start dispensing prescriptions for the pill within a week at select pharmacy locations in New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, California and Illinois, a company spokesperson said.

Notably, the chains will not provide the medication by mail. The New York Times reported the news earlier Friday.

Mifepristone is the first pill used in the two-drug medication abortion regimen.

The FDA is squaring off with anti-abortion physicians in an unprecedented legal challenge to its more than two-decade-old approval of mifepristone. An anti-abortion rights group sued the agency in 2022 in a bid to declare that approval unlawful and completely remove the pill from the U.S. market

On March 26, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in that closely watched case.

The FDA in January said it will allow retail pharmacies to offer mifepristone in the U.S. for the first time.

Under a regulatory change at the agency, pharmacies can apply for certification to distribute the pill with one of the two companies that make it. That certification would allow pharmacies to dispense the medication directly to patients upon receiving a prescription from a certified prescriber.

Before the FDA's regulatory change, only a few mail-order pharmacies or specially certified doctors or clinics could distribute mifepristone.

The regulatory change will potentially expand abortion access as the Biden administration wrestles with how best to protect abortion rights. The right to abortion in the U.S. was sharply curtailed by the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling.

The Biden administration has sought to make abortion and contraception access a main platform of the president's 2024 campaign.

Medication abortion is the most common method of terminating a pregnancy in the U.S., according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That method is approved by the FDA for use up to 10 weeks into pregnancy.

Victoria Klesty | Reuters

In the U.S., Wegovy is no longer just for weight loss. The blockbuster drug — one of a handful of weight loss treatments to skyrocket in popularity over the last year — is now approved in the U.S. for heart health, too. But that may not translate to wider insurance coverage of the weekly injection drug from Novo Nordisk and similar obesity treatments just yet. Some employers and other health plans are still reluctant to cover Wegovy due to its hefty $1,350 monthly price tag, which they say could significantly strain their budgets. They also have other questions, such as how long patients actually stay on the treatment. At the very least, some plans will take notice of Wegovy's new approval and start assessing whether to cover the treatment when they next update their formularies, some insurance industry experts told CNBC. That could mean difficult decisions ahead for insurers and likely a patchwork system of coverage for Americans who are seeking treatment to navigate. ""The more benefits that come from weight loss drugs, I think the greater the pressure is going to be to start including those drugs in a formulary and cover them in standard insurance plans,"" said John Crable, senior vice president of Corporate Synergies, a national insurance and employee benefits brokerage and consultancy. ""But my gut tells me it's going to take more to convince some insurers."" Wegovy is part of a class of drugs called GLP-1s, which mimic a hormone produced in the gut to suppress a person's appetite and help regulate blood sugar. Coverage for those treatments when used for weight loss is a mixed bag. Roughly 110 million American adults are living with obesity and approximately 50 million of them have insurance coverage for weight loss drugs, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk said in a statement. The company is actively working with private insurers and employers to encourage broader coverage of those drugs, and is advocating for the federal Medicare program to start covering them, the spokesperson added. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is reviewing the FDA's expanded approval of Wegovy and will share additional information as appropriate, an agency spokesperson said in an email. The spokesperson added that state Medicaid programs would be required to cover Wegovy for its new cardiovascular use. By law, Medicaid must cover nearly all FDA-approved medications, but weight loss treatments are among a small group of drugs that can be excluded from coverage. Around one in five state Medicaid programs currently cover GLP-1 drugs for weight loss. Some of the nation's largest insurers, such as CVS Health's Aetna, cover those treatments. But many employers don't. An October survey of more than 200 companies by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, or IFEBP, found only 27% provided coverage for GLP-1s for weight loss, compared with the 76% that covered those drugs for diabetes. Notably, 13% of employers indicated they were considering coverage for weight loss.

Downstream health effects

The Food and Drug Administration approved Wegovy for weight management in 2021. In a landmark decision earlier this month, the agency expanded that approval after Wegovy was found to cut the risk of serious cardiovascular complications in adults with obesity and heart disease. The decision was based on a five-year, late-stage trial, which showed that weekly injections of Wegovy slashed the overall risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death by 20%. The approval demonstrates the significant downstream health benefits of Wegovy — and potentially similar drugs — for severe conditions caused by excess weight. Obesity increases the risk of several conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease and even some cancers.

It also challenges what some health experts call an ""outdated"" narrative driving hesitancy among some insurers: that weight loss treatments offer only a cosmetic rather than a medical benefit. ""We haven't previously seen any anti-obesity medication decrease the risk of heart attack and stroke,"" said Dr. Jaime Almandoz, a weight management and metabolism specialist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. ""What we have is proof that treating obesity is essentially life-saving, and I think it really shifts the conversation."" And the lack of broader insurance coverage for those drugs creates a ""huge equity issue in our country around treatment access and even health access,"" said Dr. Angela Fitch, knownwell chief medical officer. Some health experts also argue that covering Wegovy and other GLP-1s for weight loss could reduce a plan's health-care costs down the line and improve future health outcomes for patients. Shawn Gremminger, the president and CEO of the National Alliance of Healthcare Purchaser Coalitions, said employers would be ""well disposed to cover"" those drugs if they are effective at lowering long-term costs. Members of that group represent private, public, nonprofit and union and Taft-Hartley organizations that spend over $400 billion annually on health-care. But he said that it will likely take years before employers have access to concrete data on the potential cost savings of covering those treatments. Gremminger added that employers are ""a little bit less focused"" on what covering weight loss drugs will mean for overall health-care spending 10 years from now. Their focus is on providing care to their current employees, some of whom will end up leaving the company down the line.

Employers have other questions, too, including about longer-term data on GLP-1s for weight loss, and about patients stopping those drugs prematurely. It also isn't clear to some employers whether patients have to stay on Wegovy for the rest of their lives or if they can eventually taper off of it, Gremminger said. Obesity and heart disease are chronic diseases, which means most patients will have to keep taking Wegovy along with diet and exercise to maintain the health benefits. Novo Nordisk said, ""not unexpectedly,"" data from their clinical trials shows that people who took Wegovy regained weight when they went off the drug. ""This supports the belief that obesity is a chronic disease that requires long-term management, much like high blood pressure or high cholesterol, for which most patients remain on therapy long term in order to continue to experience the benefits of their medications,"" Novo Nordisk said in a statement. But Gremminger said the standard of care for the long-term use of weight loss drugs is ""in flux.""

Considering the costs

Faced with the dramatic cost of covering Wegovy and similar drugs, the state of North Carolina is paring back. State employees will no longer have insurance coverage for GLP-1s when used for weight loss at the beginning of next month. The plan will still cover GLP-1s for diabetes, such as Novo Nordisk's Ozempic, along with some older obesity drugs. North Carolina's treasurer and a GOP candidate for governor, Dale Folwell, told CNBC the expanded approval of Wegovy last week doesn't change anything. ""We've never questioned the efficacy of the drug. We've always questioned what we're having to pay for it,"" Folwell said. ""Even as the scope of the use of this drug widens, it doesn't change the cost.""

He said dropping weight loss drug coverage wasn't a decision the plan's board of trustees wanted to make in January, but it did so because the plan is ""under financial siege"" due to Wegovy. That treatment cost the state's health plan nearly $87 million last year, according to a state presentation from January. Overall, GLP-1 drugs for weight loss cost the plan roughly $102 million in 2023. An outside consultant projected a $1.5 billion loss by 2030 if the state plan continued to pay for those treatments. North Carolina also estimated that continuing to cover GLP-1s for weight loss would double the premiums for all 482,000 active employees and dependents on the plan, even those not taking the drugs. Folwell said the state has been working with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, the maker of similar treatment Zepbound, to reach an agreement on costs. But he noted that the companies have rejected the state's recommendations ""at every turn."" A spokesperson for Eli Lilly said the company is committed to working with health-care, government and industry partners ""to help people who may benefit from Zepbound access it, but obstacles to that goal still exist."" The spokesperson added that policies around insurance have ""not caught up to science."" Novo Nordisk said in a statement it urges Folwell and the state health plan to ""put patients first"" and reconsider the decision to drop weight loss drug coverage. Novo Nordisk believes ""denying patients insurance coverage for important and effective FDA approved treatments for obesity is irresponsible,"" according to a company spokesperson, who said the company will continue to engage with state health plan officials to address any potential cost concerns. Both drugmakers have launched programs to help patients, with or without commercial insurance coverage, afford their weight loss treatments. Novo Nordisk says its savings program can help patients without insurance coverage save up to $500 per 28-day supply of Wegovy. The company also said roughly 80% of Wegovy patients in the U.S. with commercial coverage for the drug are paying $25 per month or less.

List prices of weight loss drugs before insurance Wegovy from Novo Nordisk: $1,349.02 per monthly package

$1,349.02 per monthly package Zepbound from Eli Lilly: $1,059.87 per monthly package

$1,059.87 per monthly package Saxenda from Novo Nordisk: $1,349.02 per monthly package

Increased competition in the weight loss drug market could force the two companies to drive down the costs of their injectable treatments, said Ceci Connolly, CEO of the Alliance of Community Health Plans. The organization represents regional, community-based health plans that cover more than 18 million Americans across the U.S. Health plans may also be more open to covering convenient and potentially cheaper oral versions of the drugs, which several drugmakers are racing to develop. Those cheaper options, though, are likely still years away. That includes cheaper generic versions of existing GLP-1s, along with treatments from rival drugmakers.

Coverage with cost controls

More employers will likely start considering coverage of Wegovy following its expanded approval, according to Julie Stich, vice president of content at IFEBP. But the plans that decide to include Wegovy when they next update their formularies will likely consider implementing certain requirements to control costs. Those requirements will look different for Wegovy's two approved uses. Most employers that cover GLP-1s for weight loss already use cost controls, according to the October survey by IFEBP. Nearly a third of companies said they used ""step therapy,"" which requires their members to try other lower-cost medications or means of losing weight before using a GLP-1. Around 16% of employers used certain eligibility rules, such as requiring employees to have a certain BMI, or body-mass index, to receive coverage.

FAQs Can I open a business bank account with an Employer Identification Number (EIN) only? An EIN is one essential piece of information needed to open a business bank account, in addition to basic identifying and contact information like your date of birth and address. Some banks may ask to see additional information about your business, like your business website and business license. Always read the requirements carefully to understand what would be needed of you during the process. Do you need an LLC to open a business bank account? It is not required to have an LLC to open a business bank account. How much money do I need to open a business bank account? The amount of money you need to open a business bank account can vary depending on the account. Some banks require as little as $0 as an initial deposit, while others may require a few thousand dollars.

Bottom line

Some business bank accounts can have hefty initial deposit requirements or monthly maintenance fees that may not be ideal for start-ups or businesses with limited cash flow. It can be advantageous to opt for a business bank account that has a $0 initial deposit requirement and low or no minimum balance to maintain. Monthly service fees can add up quickly and negate any benefits an account may offer.

Our methodology

To determine which free business checking accounts offer the most convenience, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. business checking accounts offered nationwide by online banks as well as those with physical branches. We narrowed down our rankings by considering no-fee checking accounts or accounts with easy ways to waive the monthly maintenance fees. We compared each checking account on a range of features, including: Fees

Minimum balance requirement

Mobile banking ease

Small business tools and support

Large ATM network

Account accessibility

Customer reviews, when available All of the accounts included on this list are either members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or FDIC-insured through partner institutions. This insurance protects and reimburses you up to your balance and the legal limit in the event your bank or credit union fails. The rates and fee structures for checking accounts are subject to change without notice and often fluctuate according to the prime rate. Your earnings depend on any associated fees and the balance you have in your checking account. To open an account, some banks and institutions may require a deposit of new money, meaning you can't transfer money you already had in an account at that bank.

FAQs Can you open a business bank account online? Banks typically offer three ways to open a business bank account: You can usually do it online, in person by visiting a branch, or over the phone. However, remember that some banks may offer any combination of those options. For instance, an online-only bank may only allow new customers to open an account online or over the phone. Can I open a business bank account online with only an Employer Identification Number (EIN)? Your EIN is one of a few pieces of information you'll need to open a bank account. You may also need to provide your business registration and business address. Some banks may also require some additional pieces of information, such as your business website. Be sure to double-check the requirements of your desired bank before beginning the process. Are online business bank accounts safe? As long as your online business bank is FDIC-insured (the standard is up to $250,000 for deposit accounts), it is generally as safe as a brick-and-mortar bank. It can also help to look at customer reviews to get a feel for any pros and cons and general customer experience. Can I open a business bank account immediately? Most business bank accounts should have you up and running in a matter of minutes. One of the best ways to ensure a speedy process is to come prepared with all the required documentation and double-check your information for inaccuracies before submitting your application.

Bottom line

If you're in the market for an online business checking account, you have many options. The top online business bank accounts stand out for offering features like low or no minimum deposits to open, interest on your money and rewards for debit card purchases.

The tough-love lesson in financial independence pushed her to be more mindful of her spending and income, says Renfrew, 55, the CEO and founder of billion-dollar clean beauty startup Beautycounter. ""Living in fear of not being able to pay my bills — having literally no idea — it forced me to start hustling,"" she tells CNBC Make It.

Upon graduating from the University of Vermont in 1990, Renfrew's mother gave her two gifts, she says: a monogrammed black briefcase and a check for $5,000. The check was enough to cover ""first and last month's rent on an apartment in New York,"" along with some work clothes and other odds and ends for someone just starting a career, she says.

Renfrew was free to do whatever she wanted with the money, but her mother was adamant that she wouldn't receive any more financial support.

Less than a year after moving to the city, she ""immediately racked up credit card bills,"" owing more than $1,000 on her American Express card, she says. Her mother, a real estate executive at the time, ""absolutely could have bailed me out,"" she adds.

Instead, her mom instructed her to find a way to make enough money to pay off her own debts. While Renfrew was ""frustrated"" with that response at the time, she now says she was lucky to get any sort of head start from her parents.

However, Jefferies sees opportunities outside of the leading health care names and highlighted some small- and mid-cap names that it posits can gain anywhere from 30% to 45%. .GSPHC YTD mountain The S & P 500 health care sector has gained roughly 6.4% from the start of the year. The firm screened for ""hidden gems"" that are little followed by both the broader market and analysts, with fewer than 15 covering the companies that made the list. Jefferies thinks the this corner of the health care sector is on track to outperform this year — already outpacing the Russell 2000 from the start of the year. ""The ideas are down cap, supported by strong growth theses and offer a value dynamic as well,"" Jefferies' equity research team wrote on Monday. The sector has also benefited from record levels of mergers and acquisitions in 2024 and typically performs well in the event of interest rate cuts from the Fed, according to equity strategist Steven DeSanctis. Wall Street is currently pricing in three rate cuts by the end of the year. Jefferies picked the stocks based on how well they screen in terms of growth at a reasonable price (GARP). Here are two names that made the list. Pharmaceutical firm Incyte made the Jefferies cut. Shares have dipped 7% this year. The firm maintains an $81 per share price target on Incyte, amounting to roughly 38% upside moving forward from Monday's close. INCY YTD mountain Incyte Corp. stock. Jefferies analyst Kelly Shi thinks that while Incyte's revenue from its premier chemotherapy drug Jakafi will potentially suffer a $2.6 billion hole due to loss of exclusivity, the company's foray into dermatology can make up for the gap and improve revenue stream better than currently forecast. The analyst also points to potential regulatory approval of topical eczema treatment Opzelura for use of other conditions such as mild-moderate hidradenitis suppurativa and prurigo nodularis, which she forecasts is a $1 billion market. Staar Surgical is also on Jefferies' radar. The firms $50 per share price target represents 31% upside from Monday's close. Shares have climbed 24% this year. The company specializes in the manufacturing of implantable collamer lenses for use in refractive eye surgery to lower dependency on glasses. STAA YTD mountain Star Surgical stock. Analyst Young Li thinks the company is the best long-term solution for treatment of myopia compared to current ""refractive surgical solutions."" She also notes that the company's 2024 full-year guidance leaves room for investor upside. ""Mgmt. expects ~10% growth in the US and China with at least breakeven operating margin in '24,"" the note said.

We know it's hard: We've been there plenty of times as moms ourselves. Still, we're here to guide our children in a compassionate way through difficult moments at all stages of development. Sometimes, when emotions are high — when we feel like a young child is being impulsive and destructive, for example, or when a teenager turns everything into a battle — we need guidance to steer us in the right direction, so that we can help our kids learn instead of shutting them down. As child psychologists, we've developed an acronym that can assist us all through this process, regardless of our child's age: H.E.L.P. H alt

alt E mpathy

mpathy L imits

imits Proximity Here's how to use it during difficult parenting moments:

H is for Halt

Let's say your child is hitting their sibling with a toy or has just missed curfew. Whatever their action, before you react, it's smart to stop and ask yourself: Where is their behavior coming from? We truly believe that no child wants to be ""bad."" Why would anyone want to fail and disappoint a person who means the world to them? Children generally want to make us happy, and they want to succeed. But there are biological limitations working against them. An underdeveloped thinking brain, an overactive emotional brain, and a lack of perspective leads to chaos and poor decision-making. An immature brain produces immature behavior. A child is not their behavior. Though our anxiety can interfere with our ability to see it, their behavior is a form of communication a parent is meant to decode — reflecting a need that's unmet or a skill they've yet to learn. Children often convey their struggles through ""misbehavior"" or meltdowns, and deal with discomfort and stress through tantrums and crying. Their ""bad"" behavior could mean, for example, that they're: Hungry

Tired

Overstimulated

Feeling unwanted, rejected, inadequate, sad, scared, lonely, angry, or ignored

Confused about expectations

Needing more freedom or time outdoors

Needing a limit set

Seeking connection

Getting sick

Stressed about school

Getting too much screen time

Not getting enough play or movement

Not eating a balanced diet

Struggling with a transition It's our job as the adults to see through the behavior to the heart of the issue. Still, it can be hard not be reactive in the moment and resort to unhealthy scripts we may have learned through our own past experiences. We may have been taught to hide our tears to avoid shame, for example, or to lash out with anger when we felt scared to protect ourselves. Ask yourself: Is my reaction about my emotional baggage? Meaning, ""I can't stand my child's crying because my parents didn't allow me to cry and it overwhelms me""? Or is my reaction a reasonable response to my child's behavior, like if my child yelled ""I hate you,"" and my feelings are hurt? Self-awareness can save us from falling into old patterns we adopted from our own family of origin and allow us to act from a place of compassion and intention. In the case of older children, we have some critical lessons to teach and our own reactivity might get in the way. So we may take an entire day or sleep on it before moving on to E, L, and P.

E is for Empathy

This is all about ensuring our children feel safe, seen, and heard before we get into limit setting, teaching, or problem-solving. Empathy means seeing their world as they see it and believing them when they show you how they feel. Let's break it down: Welcome their feelings. Lean in, get on their level, and make eye contact.

Lean in, get on their level, and make eye contact. Acknowledge and validate their feelings. With a soft tone, say, ""I can see you're feeling so …"" ""You must be feeling so …"" or ""You're so ____ with me right now.""

With a soft tone, say, ""I can see you're feeling so …"" ""You must be feeling so …"" or ""You're so ____ with me right now."" Really listen. Summarize and/or paraphrase (e.g., ""So what I'm hearing you say is your friends ignored you all day, and you felt really lonely"") and clarify if needed (""So no one talked to you at lunch and you felt really sad, am I understanding you correctly?"").

Summarize and/or paraphrase (e.g., ""So what I'm hearing you say is your friends ignored you all day, and you felt really lonely"") and clarify if needed (""So no one talked to you at lunch and you felt really sad, am I understanding you correctly?"").

L is for Limits

One Thanksgiving, I had my entire extended family over for the holidays. There were at least 20 people in my home. The night before Thanksgiving, we ordered Chinese food. My son, who is normally relaxed at meals, refused to sit down or eat his food. In agitation, he threw his fork across the table and screamed, ""I'm not eating this!"" My goal in the moment was to draw boundaries, create structure, and teach more appropriate behavior. I used simple statements that employ as few words as possible as I worked to: Validate my child's emotion

Convey that his behavior was not acceptable

Offer alternatives It came out something like this: ""I can see you're so frustrated right now, you don't want to eat your dinner. But you may not throw things when you're upset. You may tell us that you're frustrated or take a quick walk and come back."" In the case of my son at Thanksgiving, he exploded into tears when I set a limit. But that didn't mean the limit was wrong. I realized he needed quiet and connection from me first — in other words, empathy and proximity.

There are three IRS-approved third-party payment processors for credit card payments. All the processors accept cards from the major credit card networks, including Visa, Mastercard, Discover® and American Express. Each payment processing company charges different fees. These are the three payment processors and their fees: PayUSAtax.com: 1.82% (minimum $2.69)

Pay1040.com: 1.87% (minimum $2.50)

ACI Payments, Inc.: 1.98% (minimum $2.50) Keep in mind that if you pay your business taxes with a credit card, the card processing fees are also tax deductible. However, individuals cannot deduct the fees from their personal tax return.

Use a credit card with bonuses for meeting spending thresholds

If opening a new credit card isn't an option, you can pay your taxes with one of your existing credit cards with a bonus for meeting a high spending threshold. With this strategy, you may earn airline or hotel elite status, airline companion certificates or free hotel night certificates just by using the right card to pay your taxes. Here are some examples: You can earn American AAdvantage Loyalty Points that go toward qualifying for elite status with the Citi®/AAdvantage® Platinum Select® World Elite Mastercard® or the AAdvantage® Aviator® Red World Elite Mastercard®. Elite status begins at 40,000 Loyalty Points for Gold status and you earn 1 point per dollar for credit card spending. The Aviator card also earns a companion certificate for one guest at $99 plus taxes and fees each anniversary year when you spend $20,000. You can earn 25 Premier qualifying points (PQP) for every $500 in net card spending in a calendar year, up to a maximum of 1,000 PQP with the United℠ Explorer Card. The points can be applied toward qualifying for United Premier status up to and including the Premier 1K level. The Hilton Honors American Express Surpass® Card earns a free night certificate when you spend $15,000 in a calendar year. Complimentary Hilton Gold elite status comes with having the card, but you can be bumped up to Diamond elite status by spending $40,000 in a year. Terms apply. The World of Hyatt Credit Card comes with a Category 1 to 4 free night certificate given each anniversary year, but you can also earn a second free night by spending $15,000. Complimentary Discoverist status comes with having the card, but you also earn two elite night credits for every $5,000 spent, which can go toward elevating your status to Explorist or Globalist.

You can use a shopping portal aggregator like Cashback Monitor to compare rewards earnings on tax prep software to see which program may offer the highest return. Offers change frequently and sometimes without advance notice, so if you see a high offer, it's best to jump on it. You may also see increased offers the closer we get to the tax filing deadline on April 15. You can combine, or ""stack,"" the shopping portal rewards with a discount from any card-linked offers you may have. Limited-time card-linked offers, such as Chase Offers, Amex Offers, Citi Merchant Offers and BankAmeriDeals provide savings at select merchants when you link your associated credit card to that offer. They can be found in your online account with the card issuer. Credit card merchant offers are targeted, meaning the same offer may not be available for everyone with that card, and require enrollment, but here are some tax prep software offers we've seen in the past: Amex Offer of spend $500 or more, get $100 on TurboTax Live Small Business Tax Preparation

Amex Offer of 30% back, up to a total of $60, on your TaxAct purchase

Bottom line

Paying your taxes with a credit card is quick and easy, but it's important to take some time to plan how you can maximize your rewards earnings. Some ways to earn more points, miles or cash back during tax season include signing up for a new credit card or using one you may already have that offers bonuses for high spending thresholds. Be sure to only charge what you can pay back in full to avoid paying interest. If not, any interest payments will likely negate the rewards you've earned. Whether or not you owe any taxes, there are also ways to earn rewards and potentially save a little money if you are planning to purchase tax preparation software.

Robinhood Markets — Shares jumped 8% after the trading platform posted a surprise earnings and revenue beat. Robinhood reported 3 cents in earnings per share, versus analysts' expectations of a loss of 1 cent per share, according to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. Revenue came in at $471 million, topping the $457 million expected by analysts. Lyft — The ride-hailing operator saw its shares soar 16% in extended trading after it reported strong fourth-quarter results and gave better-than-expected guidance. The company posted adjusted earnings per share of 18 cents for the fourth quarter, topping analysts' estimates of 8 cents, according to LSEG. Revenue of $1.22 billion was in line with analysts' expectations. GoDaddy — Shares slid 2% in after-hours trading after the internet domain company reported fourth-quarter results. GoDaddy said its total revenue was $1.1 billion, up 6% year over year. Akamai Technologies — The cloud computing company's shares fell more than 3% after reporting mixed quarterly results. Earnings came in above analysts' estimates, while revenue missed expectations. Management is also guiding for adjusted earnings growth of 7% to 11% for the full year, compared to analysts' estimates of 10.1%, per LSEG. MGM Resorts — Shares dropped nearly 4% despite the casino operator beating on both top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter. Although MGM's China segment handily beat expectations, the U.S. regional casino segment suffered from effects of a strike in Detroit and labor costs. Zillow Group — Shares of the real estate marketplace rose 3% after hours following the company's fourth-quarter financial update. Zillow posted adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share on revenue of $474 million, beating analysts' estimates of 12 cents per share on revenue of $452 million, according to LSEG. IAC — The media company stock jumped 3.5%. The company's revenue of $1.06 billion in the fourth quarter was in line with consensus estimates, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization came in at $157 million, which was higher than analysts' estimates of $125 million, per StreetAccount. Upstart — Shares tumbled 22%. The online lender reported a fourth-quarter adjusted loss of 11 cents per share, which was narrower than the 14 cent per share loss analysts expected, according to LSEG. Revenue of $140 million for the quarter beat analysts' estimates of $135 million. Topgolf Callaway Brands — The stock fell around 2% after it guided toward weaker-than-expected revenue in the first quarter. The golf company forecasts first-quarter revenue to be between $1.14 billion and $1.16 billion, whereas analysts polled by LSEG had expected $1.22 billion. Airbnb — Shares slipped 4% even as the vacation lodging company beat the Street's expectations on revenue. In the fourth quarter, Airbnb reported $2.22 billion in revenue, while analysts predicted $2.17 billion, per LSEG. Instacart — The grocery delivery stock inched up less than 1%. Instacart announced late Tuesday that it would lay off roughly 250 employees, or about 7% of its workforce. The company reported fourth-quarter revenue of $803 million, slightly below analysts' expectations for $804 billion, per LSEG. DaVita — The health-care company rose 4% after reporting an earnings and revenue beat for the fourth quarter. DaVita posted earnings of $1.87 per share, excluding items, on $3.15 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by FactSet had estimated $1.63 in earnings per share on $3.01 billion in revenue. Angi — The home services platform surged 7% in extended trading after posting a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss. Angi reported a loss of 1 cent per share, versus analysts' forecast of a loss of 2 cents per share, according to FactSet.

The Nasdaq finished less than 0.5% away from its November 2021 record-high close. It was another big week for Club company earnings, with Estee Lauder , Eli Lilly , GE Healthcare , DuPont , Linde , Ford , Disney and Wynn Resorts all reporting. Twenty-one of our 32 portfolio names have now delivered their results this quarter. Looking more broadly, according to FactSet, three-quarters of the 67% of S & P 500 companies that have issued their numbers reported upside earnings surprises, while just about two-thirds reported better-than-expected revenue. It was a pretty light week in terms of economic data releases, though we did get a favorable ISM Services number on Monday. Things will pick up next week with several closely watched macroeconomic updates, including two key government inflation reports. While no Club earnings are scheduled to report earnings in the week ahead, 61 companies in the S & P 500 will deliver their latest quarterly results. 1. Consumer inflation: The main event of the week will come on Tuesday when the January consumer price index (CPI) is released. Economists are looking for headline CPI to advance 2.9% year over year and core CPI, including food and energy prices, to gain 3.8%. While the core PCE (personal consumption expenditure) price index is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, CPI will provide valuable insight into what areas of the economy are seeing sticker price pressures. That, in turn, can help forecast whether there's any chance for a March interest rate cut. Right now, the market odds favor a Fed rate reduction in May or June. A cooler core CPI print, closer to the Fed's 2% target inflation rate, would likely be taken as a positive by the stock market. Really weak data could be less well received on the thought the Fed held rates high for too long. We, however, do not believe the latter to be the case. 2. Wholesale inflation: The January producer price index (PPI) is out on Friday. Economists are looking for a year-over-year headline PPI increase of 0.6%. The CPI carries more weight because it reflects the prices consumers pay. Price stability and maximizing employment are the two pillars of the Fed's dual mandate. However, PPI is important because it provides insight into input costs that companies pay. A greater-than-expected rise in input costs could lead to companies trying to protect profits by passing those higher costs through to consumers, which would be a negative in terms of getting the rate of inflation down. 3. Retail sales: January retail sales are on Thursday. While this report doesn't provide nearly as much insight into the rate of inflation as CPI, it is a gauge of consumer health. That's because nearly 70% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), or economic growth, is based on private consumption. If the economy is going to avoid a recession (and we think it will), we need to see consumer spending and shopping remain relatively resilient. Economists are expecting a 0.1% monthly decline, not too surprising given the comp for a January monthly reading is December, which is the last month of the holiday shopping season. 4. Other data: January's industrial production and capacity utilization report is also released on Thursday, and the January housing starts and building permits report is out on Friday. The former will provide insight into the state of manufacturing, which provides indirect insight into the health of consumer and business demand. The latter, however, is likely to garner more attention as an ongoing shortage of houses remains a key factor keeping prices high. Shelter costs are a real thorn in the Fed's side because they represent large, unavoidable cost for Americans. Anything that points to more housing supply coming online should be taken as a positive. 5. Earnings: We get a break from Club earnings next week. But things will pick back up for our portfolio names the following week. That's when Palo Alto Networks , Nvidia , Coterra Energ y and Bausch Health report. However, between now and then, there are tons of releases from non-portfolio companies to monitor for a better understanding of industry dynamics and the economy overall. As important as macroeconomic updates are, they're backward-looking and extremely high-level. Earnings releases, on the other, hand provide more up-to-date information. The reported numbers may be backward-looking but the information management teams share on their post-earnings conference calls are real-time and often provide insight as to what is currently happening on the ground.

165,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/01/how-a-psychologist-stops-overthinking-everything.html,DVA,DaVita Inc.,A psychologist shares the 5 exercises she does to 'stop overthinking everything',"As a clinical psychologist, I've spent 14 years teaching people how to regulate their emotions and cope with difficult situations. One of the biggest issues my clients struggle with is overthinking. It's an exhausting habit that can turn a stressful challenge into even more anxiety. Here are five things I do when I need to stop overthinking everything:

1. Recognize when I tend to overthink

The first and most important step is pattern recognition. What times of the day do you get lost in your worries? Do you notice physical signs, like clenching your jaw? Are there negative themes that come up again and again in your head? Then reflect on when you are less prone to rumination, even when something difficult happens. You might worry less when you go to the gym after work, or when you listen to a funny podcast on your commute. Arming yourself with these details can help you be prepared with strategies as soon as you notice the warning signs.

2. Get some distance from myself

A big reason why overthinking when you are upset backfires is because it immerses you even more in whatever you're going through. The next time you notice yourself sinking into fruitless rumination, try to see the bigger picture. This strategy is called ""self-distancing."" Observe whatever difficult experience you are ruminating about as if you were a fly on the wall, rather than directly involved. Taking a step back can provide the perspective you need to feel like you can change the channel.

3. Swap 'why' with 'how'

The simplest way to replace negative thoughts with more constructive thinking is to shift from asking ""why"" questions (""why me?"") to ""how"" questions (""how can I move forward?""). Notice the difference: ""Why"" is a dead end, while ""how"" leads to action. If you went on a date, for example, and the person didn't message you after what seemed like a great time, rather than ponder why, focus on how you can create a relaxing night for yourself. By doing this, you consciously shift from unproductive ruminating to empowered planning.

4. Write it out

When you need to process your feelings or an experience, instead of overthinking, practice expressive writing. Try this exercise over the course of three days: Day 1: Spend 15 to 20 minutes writing about the stress and trauma that is plaguing you.

Day 2: Write about how the experience has affected you.

Day 3: Describe how the experience relates to your current life and what you want for the future. This practice has been shown to help reduce symptoms of depression, even weeks or months later. Researchers say it's because writing can help you go deeper into your emotions, while also creating some distance and an end point.

5. Reschedule overthinking

To make your overthinking feel less compulsive, consciously postpone it until later. Give yourself 10 minutes to ruminate about a problem at 7:00 p.m. every night, then move on. Another bonus is that there's a good chance that you'll get so caught up in your day or evening that you'll forget to return to your worries at the appointed time. When you are conscious of them, you'll be able to see your thoughts with more perspective. You want to avoid the debilitating all-day background buzz of rumination.

Where we stand,"A Wall Street firm on Tuesday struck a favorable chord on a trio of industrial holdings, reaffirming the Club's forecast for upside in shares of Stanley Black & Decker and Honeywell International . Eaton also received a well-deserved upgrade. Although the industrial sector has slumped with the broader market this week, the group experienced a solid run leading up to the second quarter. Through Tuesday, the sector has climbed nearly 24% over the past six months and 9.13% year to date, benefiting from a broadening rally outside of megacap tech stocks. In light of the upbeat Barclays note, here's a closer look at where analysts and the Club stand on Eaton, Stanley Black & Decker and Honeywell. ETN YTD mountain Eaton (ETN) year-to-date performance Barclays upgraded Eaton to a hold-equivalent rating from underweight and boosted its price target on the stock to $300 per share from $250. That implies a 4.7% decline from Eaton's close Tuesday. The generative artificial intelligence boom will lead to future sales growth for the electrical equipment provider as long as the current ""data center mania persists,"" analysts wrote in a note to clients. They also raised their full-year 2024 earnings-per-share estimates to $10.31 from $10.28. The Barclays analysts said ""it is safe to say"" their underweight rating on Eaton shares since 2022 was not one of their ""best calls"" in their coverage universe, which consists of roughly two dozen industrial-focused companies. ""The stock looks set to enjoy among the highest organic sales growth rates in [our coverage] in the next few years; this, coupled with the widespread perception that this growth is 'secular' in nature, means that a sharp valuation multiple compression may not occur for some time,"" they wrote. The Club took its stake in Eaton due in large part to its ability to benefit from the generative AI wave, as Barclays acknowledged in its upgrade. ""I don't know why [analysts] had this as a sell,"" Jim Cramer said Tuesday. ""They were obviously ill-informed. … Eaton is a part of this vast change in the grid that we've been talking about."" Similar to the analysts, we think increased demand for electricity as more data centers pop up to support power-intensive AI computing workloads will benefit Eaton's business long term. The Club increased its Eaton's price target last month to $330 per share from $290, while affirming our buy-equivalent 1 rating. Eaton has been a strong performer since joining the portfolio in November , setting a series of all-time highs on its way to a 30.7% gain year to date. SWK YTD mountain Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) year-to-date performance Analysts raised Stanley Black & Decker's price target slightly to $107 per share from $105, implying a roughly 13% increase from Tuesday's close of $94.49. Barclays reiterated the firm's overweight rating and boosted full-year EPS estimates to $4.26 from $4.17. Barclays argued the worst is likely behind Stanley Black & Decker's crucial tools business, which is in the midst of 11 consecutive quarters of volume declines. Its brands include DeWalt, Craftsman, and Black & Decker. ""We think 2023 will see trough Tools volume trends, and the company starts to make meaningful progress on inventory reduction,"" the analysts wrote. ""As [free cash flow] expands substantially alongside inventory reduction, balance sheet leverage should fall, and the stock should re-rate higher as investors can look ahead to the earnings recovery."" Barclays' view generally mirrors the Club's thesis, which is rooted in the company turning itself around from a variety of post-Covid overhangs. Stanley Black & Decker may also benefit from potential Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2024. Lower borrowing costs can increase activity in the housing sector, specifically the existing home market. This can lead to more demand for Stanley Black & Decker's offerings from do-it-yourself customers who want to buy tools for remodeling projects or various repairs. Our price target on the stock is $110 per share, which we set after its quarterly earnings results in August. We've also maintained a buy-equivalent 1 rating on the stock. HON YTD mountain Honeywell International (HON) year-to-date performance Honeywell's price target increased slightly to $232 per share from $230, implying a 15.9% gain from Tuesday's close. Analysts raised their full-year EPS estimates by a cent to $9.94, while maintaining their buy-equivalent rating on shares. The firm expects buybacks to accelerate and Honeywell to deploy more capital towards mergers and acquisitions. ""HON will benefit from management moves to shift the business mix towards a higher growth portfolio,"" analysts argued. ""We believe that its medium term margin guide will prove conservative in light of the scope for further operating improvement, and [free cash flow] conversion is rising."" This is largely in-line with our take on Honeywell, though our price target remains at $230 per share. The Club reaffirmed our buy-equivalent 1 rating and price target after the company's Feb. 1 quarterly earnings release . At last week's Monthly Meeting, Jim emphasized his belief that Honeywell CEO Vimal Kapur, who has been in the top job since June 2023, should look to reshuffle the industrial conglomerate's vast business portfolio. ""Time for Kapur to declare what he wants his Honeywell to be,"" Jim said. ""Whatever he wants will be better than what we have because it's increasingly looking like a leftover pastiche of industrials. But you do have to own it before he makes his move."" One move may be to sell its personal protective equipment division, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday , citing people familiar with the matter. The company has hired advisors to look into options for that business, which could be worth more than $2 billion, according to the report. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long ETN, SWK, HON.

Despite Trump facing legal issues on multiple fronts, including a federal indictment that alleges he illegally conspired to discount votes in the 2020 election, he appears to be cruising to the Republican nomination once again. He dominated the Super Tuesday contests, leading his main rival Nikki Haley to suspend her campaign. ""With around half of all Republican nomination delegates now pledged, Trump has won around 90% of them and has all but formally secured the Republican nomination for president,"" Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius said in a note to clients Wednesday morning. The Trump campaign has been light on policy proposals so far, but Wall Street is already looking to his previous term, as well as those of other Republican presidents, to figure out which stocks could be winners in a second term. The potential boosts could come from tax cuts and reduced regulation of major companies, for example. ""New tax cuts and an increasingly challenging fiscal profile appear more likely in a new Trump administration (provided Republicans also win control of the House and Senate), but stocks might be cheered by the prospect of continued support for the US consumer, as well as a new boost to earnings from a further drop in the corporate tax rate,"" Barclays strategist Venu Krishna said in a Jan. 30 note to clients. One group of stocks that could benefit is financials. Under a Republican president, banks and other financial companies could see lower capital requirements and possibly have an easier time getting deals through the Federal Trade Commission, according to a March 1 note from Goldman, which listed Wells Fargo and Piper Sandler among potential beneficiaries. Raymond James was listed by Goldman and in Barclays' Trump stock basket, according to the Jan. 30 note. Health-care stocks could rise for a similar reason. Barclays' Trump basket includes Boston Scientific and Vertex Pharmaceuticals . Energy is another area where government regulation is a key variable, with Republicans generally having a lighter touch on fossil fuels. A Trump term could benefit energy giants such as Chevron , but also smaller players such as Devon Energy or coal companies such as Peabody Energy , according to Goldman. One policy that Trump is pushing for is even higher tariffs on goods from China. That could be a boost to domestic steel names, such as Steel Dynamics and Cleveland-Cliffs , but also companies that are already bringing more production on shore, such as chipmaker Broadcom , Goldman found. Another group of industrial companies could get a piece of government spending from expansion of the Mexico border wall under a second Trump administration.

169,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/22/supreme-court-rejects-devon-archer-appeal-in-criminal-case.html,DVN,Devon Energy,Supreme Court rejects Devon Archer appeal in criminal case,"Devon Archer, a former Hunter Biden business associate, departs following his deposition before the House Oversight and Accountability Committee at the O'Neill House Office Building in Washington, July 31, 2023.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday turned away an appeal brought by Devon Archer, a former business partner of Hunter Biden convicted for his role in defrauding the corporate arm of a Native American tribe.

The court's refusal to hear Archer's case means the conviction remains in place and brings him closer to serving a prison term.

A judge initially ruled that Archer should spend a year and a day in prison but he has challenged the sentence. He is currently out on bail.

Archer was convicted in 2018 over a scheme led by businessman Jason Galanis to defraud the Wakpamni Lake Community Corp., the business arm of the South Dakota-based Wakpamni Lake Community of the Oglala Sioux Tribe.

Archer and others were accused of misusing millions of dollars that the corporation raised by issuing bonds and, instead of investing the proceeds as agreed, using it ""for personal purposes, such as funding personal business ventures and buying jewelry, luxury cars and a new home,"" prosecutors said in court papers.

Hunter Biden was not involved in the scheme. Galanis pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a 14-year prison term while others involved were either convicted at trial or pleaded guilty.

Archer denied any intent to defraud, saying the government relied on circumstantial evidence. The trial judge threw out the jury's guilty verdict, saying there was ""a real concern that an innocent person may have been convicted.""

Federal prosecutors appealed, and the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Archer's conviction last year.

Last summer Archer testified before a Republican-led House committee investigating President Joe Biden in an effort to link him with his son's business dealings overseas. Archer served with Hunter Biden on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company.

Archer said then he had no knowledge that the senior Biden, as vice president, sought to influence policy to help his son. He said Hunter Biden did use the Joe Biden ""brand"" to protect his business dealings.",1/22/2024,0,0.009698037,0.010222529,0.001247484,0.940351546,0.037511248,0.000969206

As it turns out, exercise is good for you. So is sleep, and unfortunately, so are vegetables. I've heard these health adages hundreds of times before, but they truly began to hit home for me this winter as I tested out a metabolic health platform from the startup Signos. In short, the company offers a subscription service that includes a small continuous glucose monitor (CGM), which you stick on your arm or abdomen, that sends that data to the Signos app which, in turn, aims to help you lose weight by keeping track of your blood sugar. The subscription price varies depending on the plan you pick. A one-month plan starts at $449, but a 6-month plan starts at about $143 a month if you pay upfront. But services like this, once reserved for diabetics, may soon offer a whole new revenue stream for health companies. Dexcom, for example, recently received FDA clearance for its over-the-counter Stelo product, expected to launch this summer. Meanwhile, Signos competes with other firms like NutriSense, Veri and Levels. I wanted to get a first-hand understanding of what these glucose monitors are like, so I gave Signos' latest system, which uses a Dexcom G7 monitor, a try. Here's what I learned.

Signos

Founded in 2018, Signos uses continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs, and an artificial intelligence-powered app to help people better understand their metabolisms. The company gives users personalized insights into how their bodies respond to specific foods and when they should exercise to get the best results for weight loss. Glucose is a type of sugar we receive from food, and it's the body's main source of energy. A CGM is a small sensor that pokes through the skin to track an individual's blood glucose levels, or blood sugar levels, in real-time. The sensor is usually worn on the upper arm or abdomen, and it can wirelessly transmit data to a smartphone. CGMs are primarily used by people with diabetes since they can help patients get alerted to emergencies. But Signos' CGM system is meant for average consumers, so it is not intended for diabetes management. Other companies like Abbott Laboratories are also launching consumer-facing CGM systems in the U.S. this year. Signos' platform teaches users how their daily habits like diet, hydration, exercise, stress and sleep affect their glucose and can cause it to spike. Glucose spikes occur when the amount of sugar present in the bloodstream rapidly increases. This often happens after eating. In the short term, spikes can cause feelings of lethargy and fatigue, but high blood sugar can lead to more serious health problems like diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease over time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Everyone's glucose levels are variable, so spikes and dips are inevitable, but Signos aims to help people reduce the intensity and frequency of their spikes. The company says that maintaining relatively stable glucose levels can help people improve the health of their metabolism, lose weight and ultimately reduce the risk of chronic disease. Getting set up

Woman with Signos wearable and app Source: Signos

To get started with Signos, I had to take a quick questionnaire that asked me for some basic biological information and details about my medical history. I submitted my answers for review by an independent physician, and my CGM prescription was approved and began processing for shipment a few hours later. After a couple of days, my kit arrived in a brown Signos box. It includes an instruction manual, the CGMs, alcohol wipes and athletic patches to put over the CGM once it's applied. I followed the instructions in the manual and downloaded the Signos app, which prompted me to set up accounts with Signos and the CGM company Dexcom . Dexcom makes the CGMs that Signos uses, though Dexcom's products are exclusively designed for patients diagnosed with diabetes. Signos is using Dexcom's CGMs as part of a clinical study approved by an institutional review board designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which monitors biomedical research involving real people, Sharam Fouladgar-Mercer, Signos' co-founder and CEO, told CNBC in October. Dexcom Ventures also backs Signos as an investor, and the firm participated in the $20 million funding round that Signos announced last fall. Signos' platform works with Dexcom's G6 CGM and the newer G7 CGM. I tested the platform using the G7, which Signos launched in January. The G6 and the G7 sensors last for 10 days, and I went through three G7s during my trial.

Once I had set up my accounts, it was time to put on my first sensor, which I was nervous about. I'm generally fine around needles, though I tend to look away if I have to get a shot at the doctor's office. The CGM's needle is small – it looks like someone clicked a mechanical pencil a few times, for comparison – but I can't say I was excited to stick it into my arm. Much to my relief, applying the sensor is easy and painless. The Signos app walked me through the process step by step, offering a one-minute video and a series of GIFs I could watch. I cleaned the back of my left arm with an alcohol wipe, placed the applicator there, pressed the button on the applicator and popped the CGM, needle and all, right onto my arm. The G7 is white, about the size of a quarter, and maybe half an inch thick. I paired the CGM to the Signos app by enabling Bluetooth and scanning the corresponding QR code on my applicator. Once the CGM was applied and paired to my app, I put a purple athletic patch on top to help protect the sensor from tugging, sweat and water. It took the sensor about 30 minutes to adjust to my body before it was warmed up and ready to go. What's good I was worried that the CGM would be painful or cumbersome, but I forgot about it often, and it's easy to wear normal clothes and jackets over it, even if they have tight sleeves. I experienced some sensitivity for a couple days when sleeping on my left side, particularly after changing out the sensor. My upper arm felt a little tender, like there was a light bruise. However, I chose to wear the CGM in the same place on my left arm each time, and I think I could have avoided that sensitivity if I had switched between my left arm and my right arm. I had never seen or interpreted glucose data before, and I thought the Signos platform did a nice job explaining concepts and breaking them down. The app led me through a series of short articles and activities to get started, like how to log my meals and exercise. It also introduced me to the concept of my ""optimal glucose range,"" which is where Signos wants you to try and keep your glucose levels. Signos starts by setting the upper bound of the range at 120 mg/dL, and the lower bound at 80 mg/dL, but the app's algorithm adjusts it based on your body's patterns. My upper bound was eventually adjusted to 126 mg/dL, for instance. When you look at the Signos home page, you can see your real-time glucose reading, your glucose level graph (which includes a shaded area to indicate your optimal range), and the percentage of time you've spent in the range each day. This could be particularly beneficial for folks who may be prediabetic and want to keep an eye on their levels over time. Once I got the hang of the basics, Signos prompted me with more activities and articles that helped me experiment and deepen my understanding of my blood sugar. For instance, one activity encouraged me to try exercising right after a meal, and when I did, I saw it drastically reduced the spike I was experiencing. Another activity had me try and guess what I thought my glucose levels were at different points throughout the day. I was surprised how quickly I began to understand the correlation between how I was feeling and my current reading. You can skip activities if you don't want to do them, but on the whole, I found them interesting and useful. Signos also has registered dieticians on staff, and users can ask them questions via chat, email or through a phone consultation. I set up a meeting after my first week wearing a CGM, and I found it very helpful. I asked a bunch of questions about my data and the Signos app itself, and I also got some tips about what to try and work on next.

I knew the experience would be personalized, but I don't think I've ever had this much specific insight into what is happening in my body. I found it fascinating to see how I responded to different foods, and there were some surprises. I frequently eat instant oatmeal for breakfast, for example, and have always thought of it as a relatively healthy meal. But in actuality, I learned oatmeal causes my glucose to spike significantly. On Feb. 9, oatmeal raised my levels from 88 mg/dL to 167 mg/dL. So while it may be a great breakfast for some people, oatmeal isn't necessarily the best choice for me. I was less surprised by my reactions to many other foods, but I still found it valuable to reinforce these concepts with data. Processed foods like chips and sweets caused large spikes in my levels, but fruits, vegetables and protein-rich meals had a much more gradual impact. I eat greek yogurt as a snack a lot, for instance, and I found that it hardly caused my levels to spike. It felt powerful to see how my body responded to nutritious food and it definitely made me more conscious of the choices I was making.

As it turns out, spikes in your blood sugar can be caused by a whole lot more than just food. That was news to me. In addition to logging meals and exercise, the Signos app has a ""Tags"" feature where you can write notes and select from a list of more than 60 different possible spike-causing culprits. Some of the options include stress, travel, medication, sickness, crying and even a hot shower. I learned that my glucose tends to spike while I'm writing a breaking news story (who knew!), and I spend less time in my optimal range when I'm feeling tired. I had a particularly stressful week at work in January, and looking back at my readings, I can definitely tell. I found it helpful to visualize how all sorts of different factors, some within my control and some not, could impact my blood sugar. It really drives home the idea that you are affected by the world around you. And for bonus points, the CGM is a great conversation starter. I found that my friends, family and colleagues were really interested in the device and what I was learning from it. Since it's not all that common for the average person to wear CGMs yet, I think there was an element of novelty there. Finally, it's easy to take off the CGM when it expires. After the 10 days are up, you simply grab the adhesive and peel it off like a sticker. What's bad Signos' user interface is easy to use, but some features were more intuitive than others. It took me a few days to learn how to input my sleep, for instance, because I couldn't figure out how to log the hours correctly. It was also hard to gauge how much detail to use when logging my meals, as I tended to keep my entries to just a few words. I might have gotten more specific insights and fine-tuned my algorithm further if I had more guidance there. Additionally, it wasn't always possible for me to engage with the platform's alerts and activities, particularly during the work day. After eating a meal, I would often get a ""Fast Rise"" notification from my Signos app, which indicates that a glucose spike is occurring. The notification encourages users to engage in 20 to 30 minutes of ""brisk walking"" or 10 to 15 minutes of plyometrics, a form of high-intensity exercise, to help reduce the spike. I work in-person at CNBC's newsroom three days a week, so this often wasn't realistic for me to do. I asked about this notification when I met with the Signos dietitian, and she told me that any movement is beneficial, even if it's just a quick walk up or down a flight of stairs. I tried to make sure to take a lap around the newsroom once I learned that, but I think it would have been helpful to know upfront, too.

The U.S. dollar rose to a two-week high on Wednesday as investors continued to take profits on short dollar positioning amassed toward the end of last year, even as they questioned market expectations of roughly six interest rate cuts in 2024.

For December, the dollar fell about 2%.

Trading was relatively subdued, with Japanese markets shut for a holiday and markets digested softer-than-expected U.S. economic data released earlier on Wednesday.

Bitcoin, meanwhile, sank roughly 5% on Wednesday after climbing to more than $45,000 on Tuesday, its highest since April 2022. Still, optimism about bitcoin remained high amid a possible approval this week of a spot exchange traded fund for the world's largest cryptocurrency.

The dollar, on the other hand, earlier moved in tandem with Treasury yields, with those on the 10-year hitting 4% for the first time in two weeks. But the 10-year yield has since declined to 3.90%, down 4.1 basis points (bps). Yet the dollar index held gains and was last up 0.2% at 102.45, after earlier touching a two-week peak of 102.61.

Minutes of the Dec. 12-13 Federal Reserve meeting released on Wednesday showed officials were convinced inflation was coming under control and were concerned about the damage that ""overly restrictive"" monetary policy might do to the economy.

However, participants ""stressed ... that it would be appropriate for policy to remain at a restrictive stance for some time until inflation was clearly moving down sustainably toward the Committee's objective.""

""The biggest driver of U.S. dollar strength through this very young year is a general repricing of expectations for the Fed in 2024,"" said Helen Given, FX trader at Monex USA in Washington.

""Traders were overzealous in their expectations of as many as six 25 basis point cuts from the Fed in 2024, and through the last few days have been paring down some of those positions.""

Fed funds futures have priced about 166 bps of cuts this year, or about six rate reductions of 25 bps, according to LSEG's IRPP app.

The dollar earlier came off its highs after data showed the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted further in December although the pace of decline has slowed.

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Wednesday its manufacturing PMI increased to 47.4 last month after being unchanged at 46.7 for two straight months. It was the 14th consecutive month that the PMI has stayed below 50, which indicates contraction in manufacturing. That is the longest such stretch since the period from August 2000 to January 2002.

At the same time, U.S. job openings fell for the third straight month in November. Job openings, a measure of labor demand, dropped 62,000 to 8.790 million on the last day of November, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, report.

In other currencies, the euro was last down 0.2% against the dollar at $1.0924. It earlier fell to $1.0893, its lowest since mid-December, and dropped 0.95% on Tuesday in its biggest daily decline since July.

A drop in inflation and a dovish tilt in the Fed's December policy meeting fueled bets for multiple U.S. rate cuts in 2024, undermining the greenback and sparking a rally in Treasuries and stocks in November and December. The dollar index hit a five-month low of 100.61 last week.

Those trends failed to carry over into the New Year, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closing lower on their first trading session of 2024, dragged down by big tech names.

The greenback was last up 0.9% against Japan's yen at 143.31, on track for its largest daily gain since late October. Earlier in the session, the greenback hit a two-week high of 143.73.

""We don't see the Fed cutting interest rates any time soon, as we've said since December's FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) presser, and the minutes today seemed to confirm that,"" Monex's Given said.

Sterling was last up 0.4% at $1.2666. It slid 0.87% in the previous session, its sharpest daily fall in nearly three months.

Analysts said the risk-off mood was also in part driven by concerns over escalating geopolitical tensions, after Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri was killed in a drone strike in Lebanon's capital Beirut on Tuesday.

Google says it's the first tech company to take action against crypto scammers, and is doing so as a way to set a legal precedent to establish protections for users. The lawsuit claims the defendants made ""multiple misrepresentations to Google in order to upload their fraudulent apps to Google Play, including but not limited to misrepresentations about their identity, location, and the type and nature of the application being uploaded.""

The Alphabet -owned company is bringing civil claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) law as well as breach of contract claims against the group of scammers, who the company said created and published at least 87 fraudulent apps to dupe users.

""This is a unique opportunity for us to use our resources to actually combat bad actors who were running an extensive crypto scheme to defraud some of our users,"" Halimah DeLaine Prado, general counsel at Google, told CNBC Crypto World in an exclusive on-camera interview.

""In 2023 alone we saw over a billion dollars within the U.S. of cryptocurrency fraud and scams and this [lawsuit] allows us to not only use our resources to protect users, but to also serve as sort of a precedent to future bad actors that we don't tolerate this behavior,"" she added.

The lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of New York, said the alleged scammers, identified as Yunfeng Sun, also known as Alphonse Sun, and Hongnam Cheung, also known as Zhang Hongnim or Stanford Fischer, conducted their scheme since at least 2019. The two allegedly lured victims to download their apps from Google Play and other sources through three methods: text message campaigns using Google Voice to victims primarily in the U.S. and Canada, online promotional videos on YouTube and other platforms, and affiliate marketing campaigns that paid user commissions for signing up people.

Sun, Cheung and their agents designed the apps to appear legitimate, showing users that they were maintaining balances on the app and earning returns on their investments, the lawsuit said.

Donald Trump's reelection campaign has begun to see warning signs that the small-dollar donors who fueled his last run for the White House have slowed their support to the former president this year, according to people familiar with the matter. Since late last year, members of Trump's team have been warned by Republican Party advisors that their small-dollar donor base could be shrinking, said the sources, who were granted anonymity to discuss internal campaign matters. Some have even been told there may not be much that the former president or his campaign can do to win back these key donors, the sources explained. The drop in Trump's small-dollar contributors could be significant obstacle as the former president faces the well-funded incumbent president, Democrat Joe Biden.

Falling behind Biden

Evidence from earlier in the 2024 election cycle already hinted at an erosion of Trump's small-dollar donor base, or support of $200 or less. In 2023, Trump's reelection campaign raised 62.5% less money from small-dollar donors than it did in 2019, the year before the last presidential election. In January of this year, Trump's campaign reported raising around $3 million from small-dollar donors, according to data from OpenSecrets. This may sound like a lot of money, but consider that Biden's political operation raised nearly $2 million in just one day, Feb. 29, according to a campaign spokesman for the president. Presidential campaigns have until March 20 to file their February fundraising disclosures to the Federal Election Commission and the public. Before that date, both sides try to shape the narrative by either playing up expectations or tamping them down. For example, Biden's campaign announced it raised $10 million in just the 24 hours following the president's March 7 State of the Union address. But those numbers won't be disclosed to the FEC until next month.

Meanwhile, Trump's campaign told The New York Times that February was its strongest month so far in the 2024 campaign cycle for small-dollar donations. When CNBC asked a Trump spokesperson precisely how much was raised, the campaign did not reply. One factor nobody disputes is that small-dollar donors are critical to Trump's ability to raise enough money to fund his presidential campaign. During his failed 2020 reelection campaign, the $378 million he raised from small-dollar contributions represented almost half of the total cash. The lion's share of this money was raised during the final year of the campaign. Between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 2020, Trump's campaign raised over $264 million from small-dollar supporters. Trump's struggle with small-dollar contributors so far this quarter could be due to donors not engaging as much with his often bombastic online pitches as they have in the past. It could also be the result of donor fatigue after nearly nine years of supporting him with contributions, people close to the Trump fundraising effort acknowledged.

Problems with big money

The drop in Trump's small-dollar donations is magnified by a second problem: Many wealthy Republican donors have yet to commit to giving millions of dollars toward a pro-Trump political action committee, or to using their extensive networks to raise money for the campaign, according to people familiar with the matter. Beyond Trump-specific entities, some donors are also hesitant to fund the Republican National Committee, or a newly created joint fundraising committee that will raise money for the RNC, Trump's campaign and dozens of state GOP parties, according to people briefed on the matter. Their reluctance stems, in part, from concerns that the RNC will use the money not to help elect Republicans, but to pay for Trump's extensive legal fees, sources said. Republican leaders insist they have no such plans. But recent developments within the Trump campaign and the party suggest that donors' concerns might be warranted.

A newly established joint fundraising committee, the Trump 47 Committee, plans to split proceeds between the RNC, Trump's campaign, state parties and — crucially — Save America, the Trump-affiliated leadership PAC that spent $24 million on the former president's legal bills in the latter half of 2023. The RNC did not reply to a request from CNBC for comment on the committee. Joint fundraising committees like Trump 47 are allowed to accept nearly $1 million from each individual donor. Biden and the Democrats have a similar joint committee, and in January alone, at least five individuals wrote checks for more than $900,000 each to the effort, dubbed Biden Victory. But outside of longtime allies like veteran investors John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, Trump has not received pledges or contributions from many other wealthy Republicans, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC. Trump's legal money squeeze is not limited to just his lawyers' bills. Over the past three months, the former president has been found liable for fraud and defamation in federal and state civil court cases. The total combined judgments ordered against Trump add up to more than $500 million. On Monday, Trump's attorneys revealed the former president has been unable to secure a $454 million bond he needs to prevent the largest judgment against him from coming due later this month. If Trump can't get a bond, he will need to pay the millions himself. New York Attorney General Letitia James has said she won't hesitate to seize Trump's properties if he fails to pay. There are other Republican donors who might eventually back Trump, however, including Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman and casino executive Miriam Adelson.

New York businessman Stephen Louro told CNBC he plans to host Trump for a fundraiser later this year in the Hamptons. The event will feature Trump and Republican lawmakers who represent Long Island's congressional districts. Louro said he plans to hold a demonstration of a jet suit at his home for guests. But Louro represents a rare commitment among New York's deep ranks of Republican donors. There are very few fundraising events currently scheduled to benefit Trump's campaign in the coming months within the Empire State, a well-known political advisor told CNBC. Trump is also expected to attend the New York Republican Party's annual gala in April, according a person briefed on the matter. That event will feature Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., a longtime Trump ally who could end up being his running mate, according to the invitation. The former president's busy schedule of courtroom appearances could also be holding him back from attending events, said a Republican fundraiser and Trump ally. Trump ""has to be at the event [in order to raise money]. How do you get there if you're in court?"" this person asked. ""The enthusiasm for voting for him is there. Maybe the enthusiasm in terms of giving may not be there.""

Chasing Haley donors

This includes — critically — Republicans who gave money to Trump's toughest primary opponent, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Earlier this year, Trump threatened to blacklist Haley donors from his campaign. ""Anybody that makes a 'Contribution' to [Haley] from this moment forth, will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp. We don't want them, and will not accept them,"" he wrote on Truth Social Jan. 24. But the threat only made it that much harder for Trump's campaign to recruit former Haley donors to the team, some of whom they spoke to as recently as March 4. So far, few of them have made the leap from Haley's camp to Trump's.

In some cases, they have ruled out Trump altogether, and committed to either helping Biden or to raising money for Republicans locked in tight congressional races instead, sources explained. A former Haley fundraiser told CNBC how an investment banker explained to him that while the person was no fan of Biden's, they may not end up supporting Trump out of concern the former president will say things that could embarrass his wealthy supporters. The previous Haley fundraising advisor also described how the CEO of a major investment advisory firm told him they did not want to give to Trump or the RNC, out of concern that being publicly associated with the former president would be embarrassing. Trump's allies still hope to recruit billionaire investor and former Haley backer Paul Singer, according to people familiar with the matter. Singer gave $5 million to a pro-Haley super PAC in December, according to an FEC filing.

But Singer has yet to decide whether he will support Trump, according to a person familiar with the matter. Members of Singer's donor group, the American Opportunity Alliance, are gathering for dinner in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday to discuss ""the future of conservatism,"" according to a person familiar with the upcoming meeting. There, Singer's allies may discuss whether to start helping Trump with their wallets. It was unclear Monday if Singer planned to attend the dinner.

Diminishing returns

The struggles for Trump's online and overall small-dollar fundraising efforts were clear to some of of his advisors before the Republican National Committee recently met in Houston, according to a party fundraiser. Less than a year ago, on April 4, 2023, Trump raised nearly $4 million online the day he pleaded not guilty to his first indictment in New York, for falsifying business records, according to Politico. At the time, it was Trump's single best online fundraising day of the year. ""The first indictment was huge for everybody,"" this fundraiser explained, referring to Trump's online small-dollar fundraising efforts. But on June 13, when Trump was in court over his handling of classified government records, the former president only raised $1.3 million from just over 35,000 donors.

Buffalo Wild Wings opened its 100th Go location on Wednesday in New York City, four years after unveiling the quick-service offshoot of its sports bar chain.

BWW Go sells the chain's famous chicken wings and other classic menu items, but its locations are smaller and limited to delivery and takeout orders. For the sports bar chain, it's a way to make its brand even more ubiquitous, while offering customers more convenience.

Since 2018, Buffalo Wild Wings has been a part of Inspire Brands, which is backed by private equity firm Roark Capital. Initially formed after a merger between BWW and Arby's, Inspire has since added other chains including Sonic Drive-In, Jimmy John's, Dunkin' and Baskin-Robbins.

Inspire is reportedly considering going public in late 2024 or 2025 and seeking a valuation of $20 billion.

BWW is the second-largest U.S. casual-dining chain in the bar and grill category with a market share of 14.4%, trailing only Dine Brands' Applebee's, according to Barclays research. It's carved out a chicken wing dominance among its closest competitors, serving more than 3 million gallons of ranch and blue cheese dressing in 2023.

But the casual-dining segment has struggled, with publicly traded rivals like Chili's and Red Robin perpetually stuck in turnaround mode.

Buffalo Wild Wings' revenue fell 1% in 2023 to $2.32 billion, according to franchise disclosure documents. A fast-growing spinoff like Go could make Inspire more enticing to potential public market investors.

Opening a traditional Buffalo Wild Wings location requires anywhere from $2.44 million to $4.83 million in initial investment, depending on the restaurant's location and other factors, according to franchise disclosure documents. In comparison, a Go location will set a franchisee back roughly $560,000 to $1.05 million.

While a BWW sports bar is around 6,000 square feet on average, a Go location is roughly 1,500 square feet. That means cheaper real estate that's faster to build and easier to operate.

""With the ability to fit into smaller footprints, it has the recognition of an established brand with the unlimited potential of an emerging one,"" said Jack Litman, president of the Munson Group and franchisee of the 100th Go location.",4/11/2024,-2,0.001514998,0.993231773,0.001316929,0.002123312,0.000537539,0.001275572

Stocks to watch,"While Starbucks has warned of price competition in China and Apple tries to drum up momentum with a new store in Shanghai, other U.S. consumer brands are seeing growth and planning for more. Domino's Pizza's China operator DPC Dash reported Wednesday its 26th straight quarter of same-store sales growth — including the pandemic period. Last year's revenue of 3.05 billion yuan ($429.6 million) was more than triple that in 2019, while net losses narrowed to about a tenth of what they've been in prior years. ""We continue to think that the company will turn net profit positive in 2025,"" HSBC analysts said in a note Thursday. ""Growth from new markets will continue to drive the overall growth of the company,"" the analysts said. Chinese President Xi Jinping last week met with visiting U.S. executives as part of Beijing's bid to bolster foreign investment in China . While advanced tech is a focus of bilateral tensions, the U.S. and China have said they are looking to cooperate in areas such as climate and tourism. China's massive consumer market of hundreds of millions of households also remains attractive to many businesses. Pizza push Domino's has a roughly 14% stake in DPC Dash, which listed in Hong Kong about a year ago. The pizza brand opened its 800th store in China in January, and plans to open 200 more by the end of the year. Papa John's , which does not break out China revenues, said it had 317 franchised locations there in 2023, up from 262 a year prior. Outside of North America, the number of Papa John's locations in China is second only to those in the U.K. The company said international revenue overall grew by 21% last year. Pizza is also taking off in smaller Chinese cities, and making the global rankings in sales. In 2023, DPC opened the first Domino's stores in 13 cities outside the better-known metropolises such as Shanghai and Beijing. Four of those new locations jumped to the top of Domino's global rankings of stores with the most sales in the first 30 days of opening, according to DPC Dash. It added that China locations have now snagged the top 19 spots for best-performing Domino's store openings. A new store in the north-central city of Xi'an came in first with sales of more than 6.3 million yuan within the first 30 days of opening, according to DPC Dash. That was followed by a new store in the central China city of Changsha, with initial sales of more than 5.2 million yuan. ""We didn't actually spend a lot of marketing dollars to let people know"" about the new stores, DPC Dash CEO Aileen Wang told me in an interview on Thursday. ""People naturally know and they come."" She characterized it as an inflection point for the company. Advertising and promotion expenses fell to 5.2% of revenue in 2023, down from 5.8% the prior year, DPC said in its 2023 results. New growth markets outside Shanghai and Beijing saw revenue double in 2023, and in the second half of the year contributed to more than half of total revenue for the first time, the company said. It noted that it hasn't begun delivery services yet for some new stores. As for whether Domino's Pizza was feeling pressure from any cautiousness among consumers, Wang pointed out the company has a starting price of 39 yuan ($5.49) per order and a 30% discount every Tuesday and Wednesday. Average sales value per order did fall by 7.1% in Shanghai and Beijing in 2023, according to DPC's latest results. ""We are certainly cautious about the catering sector in FY24E,"" Hong Kong-based investment bank CMB International said in a note last week. ""But we think DPC could still gain market share under the consumption trade down and enjoy rapid boost in growth from new markets expansion."" DPC is the third largest pizza brand in China, CMBI's analyst Walter Woo said in a separate note. ""DPC remains our top pick in the catering sector, thanks to its value for money position, huge room for expansion in China and esp. its consistent success in new growth markets."" Woo has a buy rating on DPC Dash and a price target of 73.05 Hong Kong dollars. HSBC maintained its buy rating on DPC Dash, and trimmed their price target to 71 Hong Kong dollars ($9.07) due to lower expectations about long-term revenue growth. That price target is still more than 40% above where shares closed Thursday. Western food acceptance The Hong Kong Stock Exchange was closed for Good Friday, and doesn't reopen until Tuesday. The exchange will also be shut on Thurs., April 4, for a local Chinese holiday. The mainland exchanges are closed April 4 and 5 for the holiday. ""Chinese people do eat pizza,"" DPC Dash CEO Wang said. ""As the income level goes up, the acceptance [of] Western food is going higher."" Yum China, which owns Pizza Hut in China among other brands, is set to release earnings in late April. McDonald's recently acquired a larger stake in its China operations, and in February said it plans to have 10,000 stores in China by the end of 2028. That's nearly double the company's store count of 5,903 as of the end of last year. ""Certainly in China, as you've read about and seen with a number of other companies, consumer sentiment in the country is a little bit more under pressure right now, and that is leading to – in Q4 in particular we saw the environment get more promotional,"" CEO Christopher J.

The S&P 500 lost 0.65% to 5,123.69, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.16% to 16,085.11. Both swung into negative territory after rising to new all-time highs earlier in the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average relinquished 68.66 points, or 0.18%, to end at 38,722.69.

All three major indexes finished the choppy week lower. The broad S&P 500 pulled back by 0.26% this week, while the blue-chip Dow and tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.93% and 1.17%, respectively. That decline marked the worst week for the 30-stock Dow since October.

Stocks were hurt Friday as an earlier rally in Nvidia lost steam. The artificial intelligence darling finished down more than 5% in its worst session since late May.

Despite that breather, Nvidia shares still finished up more than 6% on the week. It's part of a monster rally that has added more than $1 trillion to the stock's market cap in just the new year alone.

The Nasdaq Composite pulled back by 1.65% to 15,939.59 as technology stocks felt the brunt of the market's drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 404.64 points, or 1.04%, to 38,585.19. The S&P 500 dipped 1.02%, closing at 5,078.65.

Apple slipped almost 3% on the back of a report from Counterpoint Research that found iPhone sales plunged in China in the first six weeks of 2024.

Several other mega-cap technology stocks including Netflix and Microsoft shed close to 3%, while Tesla dropped nearly 4%. The S&P 500's information technology sector led the broad index down with a loss of more than 2%.

Outside mega-cap tech, GitLab tumbled 21% after the software company posted a weak forecast for the full year. Intel and Salesforce were the worst performers in the Dow, with each retreating by more than 5%.

Beyond tech, Target jumped 12% after holiday-quarter earnings came in stronger than Wall Street forecasted. AeroVironment rallied almost 28% following a better-than-anticipated quarterly report and outlook from the defense company.

Tuesday's moves come as investors continue to digest the market's recent rally to all-time highs, which has been powered by optimism around artificial intelligence. Despite the losses in the past two sessions, the three major averages are solidly higher year to date.

The blue-chip Dow slid 96.36 points, or 0.25%, to 37,905.45, retreating below the 38,000 level that was crossed for the first time on Monday. Tuesday's losses ended a three-day winning streak.

D.R. Horton dropped more than 9% after the homebuilder missed Wall Street's consensus forecast for per-share earnings. Lockheed Martin slipped more than 4% following a weak outlook for full-year earnings per share.

On the other hand, United Airlines rose more than 5% after reporting strong fourth-quarter results. However, the airline operator said it expects a first-quarter loss from the grounding of Boeing 737 Max 9 airplanes, the model involved in the Alaska Airlines emergency earlier this month.

Shares of other airline operators rose in tandem. Southwest Airlines climbed more than 3%, while American Airlines , Delta Air Lines and Alaska added more than 2%.

Elsewhere, Verizon and Procter & Gamble helped mitigate losses for the Dow. The pair gained more than 6% and 4%, respectively, as investors bought in following the companies' financial reports.

Those moves come after the S&P 500 officially entered a new bull market, topping its previous closing all-time high from January 2022.

But investors are deliberating how long the gains can persist, especially as the rally this year has centered around technology stocks such as Nvidia , lacking broader participation. This month alone, Nvidia is up 20%. In contrast, the small-cap Russell 2000 is lower by more than 2%.

The frequent use of them and other tech devices can be draining and distracting and still, it is difficult for us to cut down. Americans check their phones 144 times a day on average, according to a 2023 survey by Reviews.org.

Constantly looking at your smartphone can negatively impact the depth of your conversations, Anastasia Dedyukhina, a digital wellbeing expert, tells CNBC Make It. This is true even if it's just on a table nearby during a chat with a friend or colleague, according to a 2014 study.

""If I had my smartphone next to me, it would attract my attention, consciously or unconsciously,"" Dedyukhina says.

""I would also keep thinking about it because for our minds, a smartphone and the sound of a smartphone is a highly attractive stimuli. So when I hear my phone ringing and make a notification, for my mind, it's the same as if you were calling me by my name.""

Frequently switching between tasks can have consequences on your health, according to Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, who wrote a book about attention span and how to refocus when distracted. Shifting what you're focusing on often can increase levels of stress, require more mental effort to complete tasks and cause feelings of frustration and time pressure, Mark told Fast Company in 2008.

""I'm on a mountain bike ride right here in Boulder, [Colorado], and I'm eating an energy gel [packet],"" Gold told CNBC in a recent interview. ""And I was curious why you couldn't put peanut butter or almond butter in that same type of squeeze pack and have an on-the-go, plant-based protein experience like an energy bar.""

Gold had been selling nut butters at a popular farmer's market in Boulder for two years by that point. He'd landed a coveted placement in the local Whole Foods Market, too.

But at the time, consumers still gravitated toward a handful of traditional peanut butter brands. Almond butter wasn't particularly popular yet, much less the flavor combinations Justin's was selling, like maple almond or chocolate hazelnut.

So, despite positive feedback from customers, Justin's had yet to turn a profit — and Gold was still waiting tables and working a retail job to make ends meet, he said.

Within two years of introducing nut butters in tiny pouches, Justin's was profitable and Gold soon quit his day jobs, he told Entrepreneur in 2012. The business was acquired by Hormel Foods in 2016 for $280.9 million, according to an SEC filing from that year.

Here's what we want to see from each,"All three major averages posted gains for the third consecutive week, lifted by solid quarterly earnings and positive economic data. Gross domestic product data for the fourth quarter came in hotter than expected on Thursday at the headline level, but didn't little to pull down stocks thanks to softer price data. One day later, December's core personal consumption expenditures price (core PCE) index landed in line with Wall Street's expectations. In other words, the economy is growing faster than expected even as the rate of inflation continues to come down. In addition, December new home sales came in better than expected, as did December pending home sales . Within the portfolio, Procter & Gamble shares popped more than 4% on Tuesday after reporting strong quarterly results . Sales just missed estimates but profitability was solid, excluding charges related to writing down the value of Gillette and non-core restructuring measures. As a result, management was able to raise the low end of its full-year earnings forecast. Earnings season ramps up next week, with five of the Super Six mega-cap stocks delivering results. Given their weightings in the market, these releases will drive the market, for better or worse. Here's what we're keeping an eye on: 1. Jobs, jobs, jobs. Employment numbers are the most important economic data, with Friday's January nonfarm payrolls report carrying the most weight. Wall Street expects a headline reading of 178,000 jobs added. Arguably more important, however, is wage inflation data that's tucked into the report. Consumer buying power allows companies to raise prices while protecting volumes. To that end, higher wage growth equals more buying power — supports prolonged inflation. Therefore, a hot wage number hear could spook the market. As of Friday, economists expect 4.1%, which is in line with December's rate. That would still outpaces recent inflation data — core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred measure came in at 2.9% for December. If that holds, the consumer could recoup some of the buying power lost in recent years. The ADP employment report on Wednesday will give investors a bit of a read-through to Friday (though far from accurate), while the job openings and labor turnover s urvey (JOLTS) job on Tuesday will signal how tight the labor market is by analyzing the number of job openings, rate of hiring, and the rate of workers leaving their jobs. 2. Manufacturing update. The January ISM Manufacturing report on Thursday and December's factory orders report Friday are expected to show the sector still in contraction mode. Analysts are forecasting a 47.3% reading on ISM manufacturing, which measures the rate of contraction or expansion. The further below 50, the faster the contraction; the further above 50, the faster the rate of expansion. 3. Earnings. It's a big week for the portfolio with 10 companies set to report. Danaher : Management already preannounced positive results at the JPM Healthcare Conference earlier this month, but was conservative about when it expects the bioprocessing orders to pick back up. But earnings and commentary this week from peer Sartorious made us encouraged about a return to growth in 2024. Alphabet : We are looking for confirmation that the advertising market is in recovery mode and want to hear that the search giant's AI investments are helping to improve customer ROIs. Cloud will also be a key watch item as the results last time were sub-optimal, especially against what we heard from Amazon and Microsoft. This release should give us some insight into whether that was a fluke or if maybe Alphabet just can't compete with Azure and AWS. 2024 is also supposed to be the year in which cost savings and efficiency efforts really start to kick in so we want to hear what the team has to say about increased operating leverage. Finally, we'd like an update from management on how AI is improving search and helping to maintain market share, as well as any more detail on Gemini, its new multimodal AI model. Microsoft : It's all about Azure growth and AI monetization. On cloud unit Azure, we're looking for growth in the 27% to 28% range on an annual basis (26% to 27% on a constant currency basis) as enterprise spend optimization efforts wind down and budgets begin to rebound. As for AI, commentary on its Copilot feature is key as its the quickest way for the company to monetize on their massive investments in OpenAI and generative AI more broadly. Given the need for investments and uncertainty about how big will become, the Street will also look for expense guidance. We want them to invest in future growth, but management needs to ensure investors that they will be disciplined in their approach. Starbucks : We expect coffee chain will miss on sales due to a weaker China market than expected, Middle East boycotts, and a slowdown in the United States. The question is how big of a reset it will be and does the stock in the low $90s reflect these lower numbers? Some analysts argue yes, others say no. We've been waiting for this quarterly report to guide our next moves. Honeywell : Aerospace should remain strong. The bigger question is about its short-cycle markets, like in safety and productivity solutions where sales have been falling but orders looked to be finally turning a corner last quarter. We'd like an update on its M & A strategy after the company announced it will acquire Carrier's Global Access Solutions business. We thought it was a good pickup. Eaton : When this industrial announced the resignation of its CFO last week, it said it expects strong results for the fourth quarter. We'll see what the numbers show. Our focus will be on the ongoing momentum in orders for its electrical business. Stanley Black & Decker : The toolmaker will guide 2024 earnings somewhere in the $4 to $5 range as gross margins continue to recover. Watching progress on inventory reduction, reducing other costs. We're also prepared to hear that DIY demand remains soft. Apple : We're not expecting anything crazy from the reported numbers. As usual, we'll focus on services growth as this is key to further margin expansion, and would love to hear about a new record high on the installed base. The Street is expecting services will be up 12.3% from a year ago, but a decline of 2% for product sales. It's what management says outside of the reported results, however, that will move the stock. The big topic likely to come up during the Q & A is how management is addressing the recent regulatory ruling in Europe that is forcing them to open the iOS platform to other non-Apple app stores. We also expect we'll hear questions about Apple Watch demand following the removal of a blood oxygen monitoring feature on certain models to comply with a recent ruling in its battle against Masimo . Lastly, on a more positive note, we're excited to hear anything new about Vision Pro demand and perhaps any unique ways developers are looking to leverage the new ""spatial computing"" technology. Amazon : As usual, we expect AWS cloud growth and management's forward operating income guidance to be the key drivers of the stock action. We'd also like to see strong advertising growth as we think the company has a major opportunity to gain market share here, especially as they open the Prime Video platform to allow for more ads. For e-commerce, we're looking for a continued rebound in operating leverage as capacity utilization improves. Meta Platforms : We expect to see some stock action ahead of Meta's release based on Alphabet's commentary on the ad market. Specific to Meta, however, we want to hear about how AI investments are helping with user engagement, and improving targeting and ROI for ad buyers. Reels monetization is also a key focus. Last quarter, management said Reels was net neutral to overall ad revenue after a period of being a drag, as is usually the case with new mediums unfamiliar to ad buyers.

Rosner pointed to a report from Reuters that said Tesla had canceled plans to build its inexpensive Model 2 car, which he said creates the risk of no new vehicle in Tesla's consumer lineup for the foreseeable future and would put continued downward pressure on the company's volume and pricing for many more years, lowering earnings.

Please refresh every 20-30 minutes to view the latest posts.) Nvidia and a major dating stock were among the names featured Thursday by analysts. TD Cowen reiterated the chipmaker as a top pick, citing strong earnings ahead. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley lowered its rating on Match Group, citing slowing growth for online dating. Check out the latest calls and chatter below. All times ET. 7:50 a.m.: Cost cuts will lead to higher profits at Amazon, Needham says Amazon's cost-cutting actions should quickly fall through to the tech giant's bottom line, according to Amazon analyst Laura Martin. In a note to clients Thursday, Needham hiked its estimate for Amazon's 2024 fiscal year earnings per share by 12%. The estimate now shows a year-over-year gain of 43%. ""The catalyst for this note is to raise our FY24 profit ests for AMZN, based on CEO Andy Jassy's shareholder letter promising more cost-cutting at AMZN's inbound fulfillment architecture and inventory placement during FY24. We also expect FY23's cost-cutting actions to drive margin expansion throughout FY24,"" Martin said. Amazon is set to report its first quarter earnings on April 30. Needham has a buy rating on Amazon with a price target of $205 per share, implying upside of roughly 13%. Martin said that Amazon projects to be one of just a few major winners from artificial intelligence. ""AMZN is developing GenAI chips to train and drive better inferences from LLMs (large language models), AND it has the widest variety of choices related to LLMs, because it offers a captive O & O (owned & operated) LLM, and its also hosts dozens of other LLMs of various sizes,"" Martin said. — Jesse Pound 7:38 a.m.: Loop Capital downgrades BJ's Wholesale Club, believes stock has reached fair value A year-to-date rally has boosted shares of BJ's Wholesale Club to fair value, according to Loop Capital. The financial firm downgraded the membership warehouse club to a hold rating from buy. Analyst Laura Champine also lowered her price target to $80 from $85, implying a 6% increase for the stock. In the note, Champine wrote that her in-line earnings and sales estimates no longer support a buy rating for the stock. The analyst cited inflation as a key concern for the company. ""We are concerned that BJ's stock may hit a wall as investors see evidence of still-high inflationary pressures on the company's core consumer,"" she wrote. ""We see risk to management's expectation for a 20 bps lift in merchandise margin as inflation stays firm on grocery categories."" Additionally, Champine noted ""mixed"" performance at the store level. On one hand, BJ's patio furniture and apparel mix looks ""much more attractive,"" with the company's merchant making solid choices likely to drive cross-category purchases. ""That said, we still see room for improvement,"" the analyst added. ""The mix of incremental improvements and unforced errors is likely to translate to in-line comps in our view, with less upside potential than we'd need for a Buy rating given BJ's YTD outperformance."" BJ's Wholesale Club stock has risen 13% this year. Champine noted that strong membership metrics stand to protect the stock's current valuation, which is trading around its fair price. — Lisa Kailai Han 7:23 a.m.: Tesla gets a downgrade from Deutsche Bank The tough times will continue for Tesla , according to Deutsche Bank. Analyst Emmanuel Rosner downgraded the electric vehicle maker to hold from buy. He also slashed his price target to $123 from $189. The new forecast implies downside of 20.9% over the next 12 months. The downgrade comes after a Reuters report earlier this month said Tesla had canceled plans to build a low-cost car, known as the Model 2, due to increasing competition in China. The car, according to the report, would have started at about $25,000. CEO Elon Musk said that that Reuters was ""lying"" but did not elaborate. ""The delay of Model 2 efforts creates the risk of no new vehicle in Tesla's consumer lineup for the foreseeable future, which would put continued downward pressure on its volume and pricing for many more years, requiring downward earnings estimate revisions for 2026+,"" Rosner wrote. Tesla shares were down more than 1% in the premarket. For the year, the stock has fallen more than 35%. TSLA YTD mountain TSLA year to date — Fred Imbert 7:16 a.m.: BMO Capital Markets sees upside for SL Green Realty as NYC commercial real estate recovers With a recovery on the horizon for the New York City commercial real estate space, shares of SL Green Realty look poised to rise, according to BMO Capital Markets. The financial services firm upgraded shares of the real estate investment trust, which focuses on commercial properties in Manhattan, to an outperform rating. Analyst John Kim also lifted his price target to $58 from its previous $56. This updated price target is nearly 17% higher than where shares of SL Green closed on Wednesday. As a catalyst, Kim cited an improving backdrop for the New York City commercial real estate space due to higher utilization and relocation of tech workers and graduate students. ""New York City office is one of the few REIT subsectors seeing improved demand,"" the analyst wrote. ""SLG continues to exhibit strong leasing momentum, which we believe will lead to improved occupancy and Net Debt / EBITDA."" While SL Green's biggest risk has been its exposure to a high amount of debt maturities and high leverage, Kim noted that the firm has been taking the necessary steps to address this issue through debt refinancing. Upcoming catalysts for the stock also include asset disposition of at least $4.5 billion, the closing of an opportunistic debt fund and a maturing lease. Shares of SL Green Realty are up 10% this year. — Lisa Kailai Han 7:12 a.m.: KeyBanc upgrades Zscaler to overweight, citing waning competitive pressures More favorable factors have painted a bright outlook for Zscaler ahead, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets. The firm upgraded the cloud security stock to overweight from its previous sector weight rating. KeyBanc also established a $220 price target for the stock, which corresponds to a 27% upside from Zscaler's Wednesday close. Analyst Eric Heath cited positive consumer sentiment towards the firm as a reason for the upgrade. He also believes that while Zscaler's competitive concerns are still valid, their potential impact on the company's sales cycles and win rates have lessened greatly. Additionally, the analyst sees catalysts to Zscaler's adoption of the Secure Access Service Edge cloud architecture model. The firm has made the model, also known as SASE, an increasing priority in the future. ""Ongoing weakness in firewall suggests network security budgets may orient toward SASE,"" Heath wrote. The analyst compared the company's favorable risk/reward to being able to see the forest through the trees. Shares of Zscaler have slipped 22% this year. — Lisa Kailai Han 6:53 a.m.: Morgan Stanley double upgrades eBay, sees 25% upside ahead Generative artificial intelligence might be what's needed to reinvigorate eBay , according to Morgan Stanley. The bank double-upgraded the e-commerce platform to overweight from underweight and hiked its price target to $62 from $35. This updated price target implies that eBay could rise 25% from its current levels. Analyst Nathan Feather said eBay has reached an inflection point in terms of its current performance – and sees upside for the stock going forward. ""We are turning more positive on EBAY as it appears to have found a trough with GMV [gross merchandise volume] growth, active customers, and margins stabilizing in FY24,"" he wrote. Besides evolving its underlying strategy to more ""site-wide horizontal solutions,"" Feather also believes that generative AI features will help boost the stock. ""We are turning more positive as we believe the shift to scalable horizontal solutions such as AI-assisted listings can enable a balance of slight GMV acceleration while maintaining or expanding margins,"" he noted. Shares of eBay have risen 13% in 2024. Feather added that eBay stock is currently trading at a discount versus peers, with Etsy trading around 35% higher. EBAY YTD mountain EBAY year to date ""We believe this gap will narrow and EBAY can see positive estimate revisions and multiple expansion,"" the analyst said. — Lisa Kailai Han 6:50 a.m.: Evercore ISI names GE Vernova the 'key player' of electrification Evercore ISI has big hopes ahead for GE Vernova . The investment firm initiated the energy business — which spun off from General Electric earlier this month — at an outperform rating. Analyst James West's $174 price target implies that shares could rise 29% from Wednesday's close. Going forward, West thinks that GE Vernova could prove itself as ""the key player in the mission to electrify and decarbonize the power system."" The company can leverage its existing customer base and relationships to take advantage of its increasing total addressable market, which West estimated would grow to around $435 billion by 2030 from $265 billion. ""Investors have been waiting for a company like GE Vernova given its scale, competitive moat, positive adjusted EBITDA generation, and leverage to the electrification of everything mega theme,"" he wrote. West added that the company stands to benefit from rising demand and significant capital spend towards the energy transition and electricity grid in upcoming years. Not even counting rising data center and artificial intelligence usage requiring more power, the world will need 55% more electricity generation in 2040 compared to 2022, the analyst added. — Lisa Kailai Han 6:08 a.m.: JPMorgan upgrades JetBlue JPMorgan likes what it's seeing from JetBlue . The bank upgraded the airline to neutral from underweight. Analyst Jamie Baker has a $7 price target, which indicates upside of 2.5%. While JetBlue has rallied 23% this year, Baker wrote that the stock is the second least-liked airline, according to sell-side ratings. But as the airline's catalysts become even more clear in its upcoming earnings report and guidance, he expects sentiment around the stock to improve. Jetblue is slated to report earnings next week. JBLU YTD mountain JBLU year to date ""Simply put, for airline investors intrigued by the notion of a potential domestic turnaround, we expect JetBlue to largely monopolize the spotlight going forward,"" the analyst wrote. As one reason for the upgrade, Baker highlighted the company's new management, which lacks the ""high tolerance for loss production"" as JetBlue's previous CEO. Additionally, an activist shareholder has also joined the company. Additionally, the airline also has some solid fundamental business practices that are working in its favor. ""JetBlue's DNA aligns with our broader preference for loyalty, premium, and international exposure ... albeit with less vigor than the Big 3,"" the analyst wrote. ""While we continue to expect JetBlue margins to trail those of the Big 3, in turn limiting our enthusiasm for the stock, we believe the combination of JetBlue's New York real estate, established brand and management resolve may yield more turnaround momentum than elsewhere in the beleaguered domestic space."" — Lisa Kailai Han 5:47 a.m.: TD Cowen reiterates Nvidia as top pick The future looks even brighter for Nvidia , and TD Cowen expects the company's upcoming results to reflect that. The firm highlighted Nvidia as its top pick in a recent note. Analyst Matthew Ramsay reiterated his buy rating and $1,100 price target on the name. This implies that shares of Nvidia could rally 31% from its Wednesday close. Share of the tech titan and Magnificent Seven darling have already rallied 70% this year. But Ramsay said its ""full speed ahead"" for the chipmaker. ""Significant revenue and EPS growth are now largely expected following three consecutive quarters of the print coming in > $2B above previous company guidance,"" the analyst wrote. Although some investors will question the sustainability of demand for Nvidia, Ramsay is much more confident that ""all signs continue to point up"" for the stock. He pointed to Nvidia's March GPU Technology Conference, which highlighted its competitive advantage versus its peers, as well as its market-leading position as proof of its staying power. ""NVIDIA remains the top franchise in accelerated compute and AI ... and we are in the early innings of both paradigm shifts,"" he wrote. ""While valuation is above core semis, the suite of superior technology, long pedigree of innovation, and extensive growth-oriented investments should allow for strong, sustained, above-peer growth across a widening set of verticals."" Nvidia is slated to report earnings next month. — Lisa Kailai Han 5:47 a.m.: Morgan Stanley downgrades Match Growth in online dating is slowing, spelling trouble for Match Group , according to Morgan Stanley. Analyst Nathan Feather downgraded the Hinge and Tinder parent company to equal weight from overweight. He also cut his price target to $37 from $53, implying upside of 14.6%. ""After 2 years of underperformance, we step to the sidelines on online dating as user growth remains cloudy,"" Feather wrote. ""We believe that soft user growth is more attributable to a lack of innovation than saturation as ~70% of US singles actively looking for a relationship do not currently use online dating."" ""We are cautiously optimistic that innovation could reaccelerate user growth at Tinder and Bumble, especially as they have a wide slate of improvements to the core user experience planned for 2024,"" he added. ""However, visibility into the potential success of these initiatives is low and, as online dating is a momentum business, it will likely take some time to sustainably reaccelerate growth."" Match Group shares are down more than 11% year to date. Last year, the stock dropped 12%.

On four straight down sessions, the index was down 2% for the week, as of Wednesday's close. First quarter earnings season is ramping — and so far, the results have been mostly positive. Needham says cost cuts will lead to higher profits at Amazon . The analysts hike their earnings-per-share (EPS) full-year estimate. Club name Amazon reports its quarter on April 30. Micron Technology is about to get $6.1 billion in grants for the federal government's CHIPS Act. It's surprising people, which is odd because Micron is a largely U.S. builder and should be rewarded. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company delivers a very strong quarter. It was initially viewed as positive but then it sold off. Was the EPS beat not enough? The Club's chipmakers are Nvidia and Broadcom . KeyBanc cuts CrowdStrike price target to $376 per share from $430. The analysts point to a survey that says demand may be softer. I do find this hard to believe. In cybersecurity, we own Palo Alto Networks . Piper Sandler raises Conocophillips price target to $157 per share from $145. The three most loved right now are Conoco, Chevron and Diamondback Energy for growth lovers. We like and own Coterra Energ y for the Club. Piper takes Chevron PT to $204 from $180. Two quarters ago, you couldn't give this stock away. Deutsche Bank downgrades Tesla to hold from buy on a thesis-changing pivot. The analysts say robotaxis are not the route to a higher stock price. They say their buy rating on the stock was based on a coming cheaper EV model. That's what the Chinese are doing. What a nightmare. Needham cuts Rivian Automotive price target to $13 per share from $18. The analysts say overall demand weaker and used sales not holding price either. However, they say there's good demand for used. Morgan Stanley double upgrades eBay rating to overweight from underweight (buy from sell) and hikes price target to $62 per share from $35. EBay is like PayPal , enjoying a renaissance. The analysts at Morgan Stanley also take Etsy to a sell-equivalent and cut PT to $55 from $64 on limited frequency growth. Citi hikes ServiceNow price target to $906 per share from $896. Larger deals and good beat and raise coming. Providing a positive second-half outlook. Bullpen name reports this coming Wednesday.

Investors will be tuning into the company's fourth quarter earnings call on Feb. 6, eager to hear more about how that rollout is going. One key statistic will be the number of commercial health insurers providing coverage of the drug, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Nov. 8. Lilly also is expected to reveal its outlook for 2024 for the first time. Zepbound, a once-a-week injection, has only been available in pharmacies since early December, but the average analyst expects that the drug's sales reached $75 million in the fourth quarter, according to StreetAccount. More importantly, by the end of 2024, analysts expect sales to ramp up to $3.79 billion, then more than double to $7.83 billion by 2025. Those estimates have been creeping higher heading into Eli Lilly's report, and analysts see the potential for further upside when Lilly provides its outlook. 'Off to a strong start' ""While we acknowledge that the launch is off to a strong start, with Zepbound achieving greater TRx [total prescription] volume than Mounjaro on a launch-adjusted basis, we are relatively conservative in our 4Q estimate based on the timing of the launch (late in 4Q) and what we expect will be relatively high gross-to-net discounts (in the ~80% range),"" wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Chris Shibutani in research note on Sunday. Goldman Sachs said the data from market researcher IQVIA suggests that Zepbound is capturing market share from Novo Nordisk's anti-obesity drug Wegovy, but the entire category has been growing. ""We view payor access and supply as key debates in the early launch — where access is gated not only by formulary adoption, but also employer opt-ins; and supply continues to be tight across LLY's portfolio of incretin products,"" Shibutani said. Lilly's Mounjaro and Zepbound both use tirzepatide as an active ingredient, but Mounjaro is indicated for type 2 diabetes, while Zepbound aids weight loss. Tirzepatide mimics two incretin hormones in the body, GLP-1 and GIP, to regulate insulin and control hunger. Trulicity, another diabetes treatment sold by Lilly, also is considered an incretin. Drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound have been hailed for their ability to help patients shed more pounds than earlier types of weight loss medications, with Zepbound's average success even topping Wegovy's in clinical trials. Still, patients seeking these drugs can face significant hurdles. For example, patients covered by Medicare cannot get coverage for these drugs due to federal regulations. However, at least 16 states have expanded access to some anti-obesity medications, according to Bank of America. Some commercial insurance plans require prior authorizations or have limitations on the use of these drugs. Paying out of pocket isn't an option for many patients as the drugs both have list prices that top $1,000 for a month's supply. According to Bank of America, more than 80% of commercial insurance plans have put Wegovy on the formulary (the list of covered drugs) and about half of employers have opted into it. It took time for Novo Nordisk to reach that level of access. Investors are curious to learn if Eli Lilly's path is any easier. Access is only one barrier. Novo and Lilly have also been working hard to boost manufacturing capacity, but supply has been strained trying to meet the demand. A rich valuation LLY 1Y mountain Eli Lilly shares over the past year. But even good news about Zepbound's launch might not be enough to propel Lilly's stock higher. Goldman's Shibutani has a neutral rating on Lilly shares and a price targe of $600, which implies shares could fall nearly 5% from they started the week. His expectations are considerably lower than the average analyst price target of about $653, according to FactSet. Shibutani's view speaks to Lilly's rich valuation. While most pharmaceutical companies tend to trade at around 18 times earnings and Lilly's historic average over the past decade is around 22 times, its shares have lately been approaching a multiple of nearly 40 times earnings. While Lilly's opportunity in obesity treatments steals most of the attention these days, the Indianapolis-based company also has other promising products in its pipeline, leaving some analysts more upbeat about the stock's outlook and the potential for further upside. Bank of America analyst Geoff Meacham is in this camp. He has a buy rating on Lilly shares, and expects the stock could hit $700 over the next 12 months. Lilly is one of Bank of America's favorite large-cap biopharma stocks because of its ""best-in-class"" portfolio, including promising immunology and oncology treatments. In the near future, the FDA is expected to approve donanemab, an Alzheimer's disease treatment. Other potential catalysts for the stock later this year will be readouts on research Lilly is conducting on tirzepatide as it explores its potential as a treatment for other conditions such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a type of liver disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. These studies could expand the number of patients who will be able to use Mounjaro and Zepbound. 'A lot of angst' But heading into earnings, next due on Feb. 6, Meacham said there's often ""a lot of angst."" One area that could prove trickly is Lilly's 2024 earnings forecast. Morgan Stanley analyst Terence Flynn said his view was 3% below the average estimate on Wall Street at the time he wrote a Jan. 11 research note, as he expects a ""more significant step up"" in operating expenses. ""We see the set up for the stock similar to the company's 2023 guidance outlook — where revenue was slightly ahead of consensus and EPS was below, but investors are generally focused on the top-line growth outlook nearer-term,"" said Flynn, who has the equivalent of a buy rating on Lilly shares. Zepbound is tracking above Morgan Stanley's prior estimates, which prompted Flynn to raise his 2024 sales estimate for the product to $5.5 billion from $3 billion previously. At the same time, he anticipates that the number of prescriptions for Trulicity and Mounjaro will be lower than previously forecast. This trend could be occurring as patients switch to Zepbound from Mounjaro or Trulicity. According to Flynn, Lilly has said that about a third of Trulicity patients stop taking the drug each year for one reason or another. By 2025, Flynn estimates Mounjaro and Zepbound supply challenges will ease, allowing Zepbound sales to reach $11 billion, which is higher than his prior estimate of $5 billion, and the average analyst consensus. Add in Mounjaro and the tirzepatide drugs as a class will reach $23 billion, he said. But even if Lilly shares sell off on the earnings news, the investment case is likely to remain intact because ""there's just such a scarcity of value and growth names like this one,"" Meacham told CNBC. ""I'd say in the past couple of quarters, the stock has really been under pressure because they're going to disappoint somebody ... but the fundamental case is 100% supported, even with this multiple, so I think that's why usually the stock sells off, and then the next day more than makes it up."" —CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",1/24/2024,0,0.000718592,0.994908869,0.000726444,0.002113583,0.00116343,0.000369106

U.S. inspectors recently uncovered new manufacturing problems at an Eli Lilly plant that has been under scrutiny by federal investigators, according to government records obtained by Reuters.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspection in July at Lilly's Branchburg, New Jersey, plant detected eight separate deficiencies. They included problems in tracking manufacturing process and quality controls, as well as lapses in its calibration of equipment and failure to properly maintain facilities and equipment, the inspection report shows.

Lilly said in a statement to Reuters that the inspection followed a company request to the FDA to make a change to its manufacture of migraine treatment Emgality. Lilly did not provide details of the change.

The FDA visit ""resulted in some observations that were, in most cases, either addressed during the inspection or already in progress as program improvements,"" Lilly said. ""Importantly, this situation does not affect the quality, safety or supply of any current or planned Lilly products in the marketplace.""

The FDA declined to comment. Other drugs produced at the plant include the widely used diabetes medicine Trulicity as well as cancer treatments Erbitux and Cyramza.

Lilly has become the world's most valuable healthcare company by market capitalization. Its shares rose 59% last year on surging demand for Mounjaro, a diabetes drug that is also a powerful obesity treatment. The drug was approved for weight-loss under the brand name Zepbound in the U.S. late last year.

Yet the Indianapolis-based drugmaker has been cited multiple times for manufacturing problems at its U.S. plants over the last few years, Reuters has reported.

The Branchburg facility has been the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice probe following a separate Reuters story in 2021 that detailed allegations of poor manufacturing practices and data falsification.

Lilly and the Justice Department declined to comment on the status of that inquiry.

Three regulatory experts who reviewed the new inspection report described the most recent lapses as serious.

""It's like whack-a-mole at this plant. The company seems to address one set of problems, only for other serious concerns to keep popping up,"" said Steven Lynn, a former head of the FDA's Office of Manufacturing and Product Quality.

The inspection report, which Reuters obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, was partially redacted so it was not possible to determine which drugs might have been affected.

'Concerning' problems

The report described inadequate protection of electronic records detailing their manufacturing process, which could leave the company open to potential data manipulation.

Inspectors also cited inadequate training of staff who were testing samples of the drugs and examples of missing samples meant to show the stability of the medicines before their release. The company failed to address those missing samples in a timely manner, the report noted.

One particularly concerning finding suggested neglect of equipment and the facility overall, said one of the experts, a government official with knowledge about such manufacturing issues.

For instance, the inspectors noted discoloration of a container used to purify the active ingredient of drugs, which could lead to contamination, said the expert, who did not want to be named because they were not authorized to speak to media.

Former FDA official Lynn agreed the problems were ""concerning,"" especially the issue with the electronic tracking system, which is meant to ensure ""test results and other lab activities can't be changed by someone.""

The three experts interviewed by Reuters said the FDA could categorize such lapses as the most serious, or ""Official Action Indicated,"" when it responds to the inspectors' findings. The FDA declined to comment on the timing of any response.

However, the ultimate rating of the inspection could be less severe if the company was already taking ""robust corrective and preventive actions"" to ensure the quality of drugs made at the facility, Lynn said.

Late last year, Lilly and a former employee agreed to settle a lawsuit in which the worker claimed she was terminated after pointing out poor manufacturing practices and data falsification, according to court filings.

He said he's waiting to see results from the electric vehicle giant's upcoming earnings report, but said Tesla may have hit a ""growth pause,"" compared to its Big Tech peers that are still on the rise. If Tesla falls out of favor, he said he thinks pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly is a solid contender to take the company's place.

The other members of the Magnificent Seven include Apple , Amazon , Alphabet , Meta , Nvidia and Microsoft .

""We're ready no matter what, but to ignore the decline of Tesla or the advance of Eli Lilly is to reject the facts,"" Cramer said. ""There's a real challenge to Tesla's greatness. I don't see that going away anytime soon.""

Tesla's stock is down nearly 16% so far in 2024, according to FactSet. Cramer said there's been a host of issues plaguing Tesla on Wall Street, including stiff competition from Chinese EV-makers, as well as possible saturation in the U.S. market. And the automotive industry seems to be reducing its focus on EVs. Hertz announced last week it would be selling roughly a third of its EVs, most of which are Teslas. In October, General Motors and Honda Motor scrapped their plans to jointly develop EVs in the face of slower-than-expected demand.

At nearly $600 billion, Eli Lilly leads the pharmaceutical industry in terms of market capitalization. Cramer cited investor Ken Langone, who said in December that Lilly is poised to be the first drug maker worth $1 trillion. Lilly is known for its diabetes and weight loss medication, which Cramer said may be the biggest drug in history.

""I say let's see what Tesla does. If it falters, we can keep things at a 'Super Six' level until Lilly reports on Feb. 6,"" he said.

Here are their picks: Eric Wolff, Gumshoe Capital Management Investment Idea: Pason Systems Energy company Pason Systems is a dominant provider of EDR, or electronic drilling recorder, a solution for the oil and gas industry, according to Eric Wolff, portfolio manager at Gumshoe Capital Management. Wolff sees between 45% and 180% upside for Pason, which he said has between 60% and 85% of market share in the Western world. ""Pason offers a superior service that is hard to duplicate. ... We think this is an excellent business that deserves to trade a healthier multiple than it does today,"" Wolff said, adding that the company is trading at an oil and gas multiple rather than at a software valuation. ""We think this is a near monopolistic business ... even if the multiple doesn't expand, we can achieve 18% returns through cycle just based on the calendar for business,"" he added. Shares have added roughly 4% this year and jumped more than 19% over the past month. Michelle Ross, StemPoint Capital Investment Idea: Crinetics Pharmaceuticals One stock that could nearly double from the surge of interest around weight loss drugs and an increased focus on endocrine health is Crinetics Pharmaceuticals, according to Michelle Ross, chief investment officer at StemPoint Capital. The stock is up nearly 33% year to date. Crinetics, which develops therapies for endocrine diseases, can tap into a multibillion-dollar potential U.S. market opportunity as it targets therapeutics for Cushing disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Ross said. Endocrinology is an $8 billion market, but the cumulative market size, including the company's future therapy targets, is upward of $200 billion, which includes estimates for future obesity drugs, the investor said. She has a one-year price target of $88 for the stock, implying 92% upside, while her long-term price target of $339 suggests a whopping 665% upside for the company. Ross said she expects significant outperformance for years to come, competing with the likes of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, as the ""obesity market moves from an injectable to an oral pill."" During the last three years, Crinetics delivered 200% outperformance, as compared to the SPDR S & P Biotech ETF (XBI) , she said. This year, Crinetics is up by more than 31%, whereas XBI has risen 1.8%. CRNX YTD mountain Nikhil Daftary, NK Capital Investment Idea: Alimentation Couche-Tard A Canadian operator of global convenience stores is a buying opportunity in an industry that is often overlooked, according to Nikhil Daftary, co-founder and partner at NK Capital. Alimentation Couche-Tard is listed in Canada but makes most of its profits in the U.S., where it is the second-largest convenience store chain, behind only 7-Eleven, Daftary said. It has CA$75 billion market cap with an ""unbelievable record of success,"" according to the investor. What's more, Daftary anticipates that scale gas stations will be a surprising beneficiary of the growth in electric vehicle adoption. ""We believe Couche-Tard is one of the greatest success stories in public markets priced like a value stock,"" Daftary said, adding that the company has a share price to match an 18% CAGR. ""We believe the company can grow EPS in mid-teens growth rate for many years to come"" that can one day rival some of the world's biggest chains, such as Starbucks and McDonalds. ""We think Couche can be one of the biggest retailers in the world one day,"" he said.

Danely's $820 price target on the buy-rated blockbuster chipmaker suggests 3.6% potential upside for shares since Monday's close. Although consensus estimates for semiconductors fell 17% during earnings season, that ""likely doesn't matter,"" Danely said. He noted that valuation remains one of the biggest risks for semi stocks, however. ""While demand is mixed, we remain bullish on the group and expect overall semi revenue growth of at least 11% YoY in 2024 given units declined a whopping 19% in 2023, the biggest decline since 2001,"" Danely wrote. The analyst mentioned that companies focused on semiconductor equipment should grow on positive capex revisions and HBM, or high-bandwidth memory chips. The DRAM market should also improve, he said. Citi also named Micron Technology its top semiconductors pick and reiterated its buy rating on the stock, expecting continued upside for shares. — Pia Singh 5:56 a.m.: Goldman Sachs stock is at an 'attractive entry point,' Edward Jones says Edward Jones initiated coverage of Goldman Sachs with a buy rating. ""With a premier investment-banking franchise, we believe that GS is well-positioned to benefit from a more favorable environment for capital-markets activity, particularly for mergers & acquisitions and equity initial public offerings,"" analyst James Shanahan wrote in a Monday note. ""The current share price represents an attractive entry point for long-term investors."" The firm added that it expects lower earnings volatility as Goldman shifts its focus away from consumer finance, notably its Marcus and GreenSky lending platform, and towards its asset and wealth management divisions. Goldman's shares are up roughly 7.2% over the past year and 1.1% in 2024. — Pia Singh 5:38 a.m.: Citi downgrades Sunoco as NuStar Energy acquisition remains incomplete Sunoco appears to be overvalued since its share price run-up, according to Citi. Analyst Apiro Dounls downgraded the gas station owner to neutral from buy but kept his $65 price target, which implies shares could gain 6.4% over the next 12 months. The firm had previously upgraded the stock to buy after Sunoco announced in January that it would acquire pipeline operator NuStar Energy. ""We continue to expect both of those merits to be realized; however, SUN has largely closed the valuation gap since the deal announcement. Investors largely accepted the accretion and synergy merits,"" Doubles wrote in a Tuesday note. With the deal not yet closed and little incremental data, we're downgrading to Neutral and see risk-reward as more balanced following outperformance."" Sunoco shares have gained more than 32% over the past year, and 1.1% since the start of the new year. The stock now trades in line with diversified peers, the analyst said. ""With the deal not yet closed, we don't expect SUN to be able to demonstrate success here for the next several quarters,"" Doubles said. — Pia Singh 5:38 a.m.: Berenberg hikes Eli Lilly price target Eli Lilly has been on a tear this year, and Berenberg expects even more gains from here. Analyst Kerry Holford reiterated his buy rating on the stock and raised his price target to $850 from $680. The new forecast implies upside of 10% from Monday's close. Holford cited prescription trends around the company's weight loss drug Zepbound for the target increase. ""Early prescription trends for Zepbound in obesity are encouraging,"" the analyst said. ""Our discussions with obesity experts confirm that patient demand for drug therapy remains high and support an appreciation of Zepbound's superior clinical profile. We forecast Zepbound to achieve almost USD5bn sales in its first full year on market."" Shares have rallied 32% year to date, and they're up 143% over the past 12 months.

201,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/15/solar-industry-tries-to-protect-itself-against-trump-2024-election-win.html,ENPH,Enphase,Solar CEOs bet that red state investments will protect them from threat of Trump repealing IRA,"Solar industry CEOs are confident a Republican victory in the 2024 election wouldn't spell the end of government support for clean energy investments, particularly for manufacturing, despite GOP threats to gut President Joe Biden 's landmark Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA has been touted by the Biden administration as providing funds for the largest investmen t in clean energy in U.S. history, intended to accelerate the transition away from fossil and toward renewable fuels, all while creating manufacturing jobs. Republicans unanimously opposed passage of the legislation in August 2022 and sought to repeal the clean energy tax credits during a battle over the debt ceiling last spring. Former President Donald Trump 's campaign officials told the Financial Times in November that he would look to cut some of those tax breaks if returned to the White House. Just last week, Republicans again signaled that they intend to ax the credits, with the House Budget Committee voting to advance a budget resolution that would ""dismantle"" the IRA and repeal what lawmakers called ""green corporate welfare,"" according to a GOP summary of the proposal. IRA tax credits that support clean electricity generation and storage, such as wind and solar, are projected to cost about $200 billion through 2031, according to estimates from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The solar industry has been a major beneficiary of the credits. First Solar , the largest panel manufacturer in the U.S., expects to receive about $1 billion in tax credits this year for making its products domestically. First Solar CEO Mark Widmar told CNBC ""there's no doubt"" Republicans will consider repealing provisions of the IRA to fund tax cuts and rein in the deficit if they secure a ""clean sweep"" of Congress and the White House this November. Widmar is confident, however, that the GOP does not want to undermine domestic manufacturing. ""Where we put our factories are in Republican states. They don't want to undermine that,"" Widmar said in an interview. First Solar is headquartered in Arizona, a key swing state, and operates three factories in Ohio with plans underway to open two additional plants in Louisiana and Alabama over the next two years. The company released an economic impact study last month that estimated its 2023 operations directly and indirectly support more than 16,000 jobs, a number that's projected to grow to 30,000 in 2026. ""We're trying to stay actively engaged with Republicans in that regard and help them understand what we've been able to create here and the benefits of having a constructive policy, which may be different than what [the] IRA is, but still a constructive policy to support renewable energy,"" said Widmar, who's served at First Solar since 2011. 'They would be stupid' Investments in clean energy have surged since the IRA became law in 2022. The deployment of large, utility-scale solar and energy storage projects grew by 50% to $53 billion in 2023 compared with the prior year, according to data from the Rhodium Group . Congressional districts represented by Republicans have disproportionately benefited from the investments, according to a December report from the liberal think tank Center for American Progress that analyzed Rhodium's data. Some 57% of the 211,000 jobs created across 45 states and Puerto Rico since the IRA's passage are in GOP districts, according to the report. Eight of the top 10 congressional districts in terms of solar investments are represented by Republicans, according to the think tank. Enphase CEO Badri Kothandaraman is blunt that repealing the IRA tax provisions would hurt domestic manufacturing. Enphase makes inverters, a crucial component that converts solar energy harvested by panels into electricity that's usable in homes and in the power grid. The company's manufacturing facilities are in Columbia, South Carolina and Arlington, Texas . ""We are making millions of microinverters in two plants in the U.S. They would be stupid to basically harm that,"" Kothandaraman told CNBC in an interview in February, referring to Republicans. ""U.S. manufacturing is at its best right now — that's the best thing Biden did."" ""I doubt Trump will do anything to reverse that. That's our position,"" Kothandaraman said. Enphase booked a net benefit from the IRA production tax credit of $41.8 million in 2023, according to its fourth-quarter financial results . Underappreciated repeal risk The likelihood of Congress repealing IRA tax credits is low because it would require unified Republican control government, said Tobin Marcus, a policy and politics analyst at Wolfe Research. Still, the risk is real, and underappreciated by investors, Marcus said. Wolfe Research sees a 40% chance of the Republican Party winning unified control of government in November, with the Senate falling to the GOP if Trump wins the presidency. In that scenario, the firm sees a 50% chance that the Republicans will roll back some of the tax credits in an attempt to find budgetary offsets to cut taxes. ""From a corporate, financial decision making perspective, the overwhelming likelihood is this stuff will stay in place,"" Marcus told CNBC. Investors, however, need to be mindful of the risk because ""six months from right now we could find ourselves in a world where people are staring down the barrel of a Republican trifecta,"" he said. Marcus said the electric vehicle tax credits face the greatest risk, with Trump having repeatedly attacked those provisions on the campaign trail in an effort to win over Detroit autoworkers. Republicans appear less opposed to the wind and solar tax credits, Marcus said. They could, however, seek to phase out these credits earlier than the current timeline, rather than fully repeal them, in an effort to free up money for their agenda, he said. But the debt ceiling battle last spring could prove instructive, Marcus said. While Republicans in Midwestern states were able to prevent the party from voting against biofuel and ethanol tax credits, a provision to repeal credits that benefit solar remained in the debt limit legislation . But no one believed that the GOP debit limit bill would actually pass either, Marcus said. It could be tougher for some Republicans to vote to repeal IRA tax provisions that support jobs in their districts through a reconciliation bill that actually has a chance of passing a Republican-controlled Congress, he said. 'Political tail winds' Under current law, investment and production tax credits phase out for projects that start construction in 2032, or when the Treasury secretary determines carbon emissions from electricity generation have been reduced by 75% from 2022 levels, according to the Department of Energy . Nextracker CEO Dan Shugar told CNBC the fact that these provisions are in the tax code should make them more durable. Nextracker builds devices that allow solar panels to track the position of the sun. The IRA has helped the company more than double its manufacturing footprint across the U.S., he said. ""The IRA provisions that are really most impactful to the market are tax code,"" Shugar said. ""Those tend to have a lot of persistence. The day after the election, those don't evaporate,"" he said. ""Most of the factories that we're building are across the political spectrum, so there's a lot of jobs in a lot of places,"" the CEO said. ""We think there's a lot of political tail winds for what we're doing,"" he said. Nextracker is forecasting an IRA tax benefit of $50 million to $80 million in the fourth quarter of its 2024 fiscal year in the form of lower sales costs via rebates, according to its most recent financial results . Sunnova CEO John Berger views divided government as the most likely outcome in November, which would preserve the status quo on the IRA. Based in Houston, Sunnova is one of the leading residential solar installers in the U.S. Berger said the traditional oil and gas industry also has a stake in the IRA due to credits that support hydrogen production and carbon capture technology. ""We don't need any more subsidies or anything else of that nature,"" Berger told CNBC. ""We can certainly make do with this. I think we're in a good political position for the first time.""

Synchrony Bank High Yield Savings stands out for offering users ATM access, which other accounts on this list do not unless you sign up for the bank's checking account. Synchrony savers can get an ATM card to easily access their cash for free at any ATM displaying the Plus or Accel logos. Plus, Synchrony Bank refunds up to $5 per statement cycle in domestic ATM fees charged by other financial institutions.

FAQs Do all banks charge for savings accounts? Not all banks have savings accounts with fees attached to them. You can easily find a savings account that doesn't charge you. When shopping around, make sure to read the terms and conditions and small print so you know before signing up. Some bank accounts have ways you can get around fees, too, like waiving a monthly service charge if you opt into paperless statements. Can I open a free savings account? You can certainly open a free savings account — and this list is a good place to start. Most savings accounts take not even 10 minutes to apply and just require a government-issued ID like a passport or driver's license, Social Security number, address, contact information, date of birth and a checking account routing number to deposit money. Can I get a high yield with a free savings account? Some free savings accounts offer higher yields than others, but all at least on this list are above the national savings average. If your priority is maximizing your savings, however, check out CNBC Select's list of interest savings accounts offering around 5% APY. Sometimes, the higher interest-bearing savings accounts require minimums. Are free savings accounts FDIC-insured? There are plenty of savings accounts — free or not — that are FDIC-insured, so don't settle for one that isn't and check to make sure your bank offers FDIC coverage. (All of the savings accounts on this list have FDIC insurance coverage.) Though the FDIC protects up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank for each type of account ownership category, some financial institutions have been increasing the amount savers can insure in a single account by spreading customer deposits across multiple FDIC-insured banks. Can I get ATM access with a free savings account? Few savings accounts — let alone free ones — offer ATM access. While you usually have to open a checking account to get ATM access, the Synchrony Bank High Yield Savings offers savers an ATM card so they can easily access their cash at any ATM displaying the Plus or Accel logos. Synchrony Bank currently doesn't charge a fee to use an ATM, but the ATM owner/operator may. For these domestic ATM fees charged by other financial institutions, Synchrony will refund up to $5 per statement cycle.

Our methodology

To determine which savings accounts made this list, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. savings accounts offered by online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions. We narrowed down our picks by only considering those savings accounts with above-average rates that offer no fees whatsoever, including zero: Monthly maintenance fees

Excessive transactions fees

Overdraft fees

Insufficient / non-sufficient funds fees Note that we did not consider wire fees since we found that most banks charge a wire fee for outgoing transfers. We then narrowed down our picks even further by only highlighting those savings accounts that currently do not require any minimum deposits to open an account or minimum balances to earn interest. Although the accounts on this list don't require you to reach certain minimums, the respective banks may close your account if it remains unfunded for a while. All of the accounts included on this list are FDIC-insured up to $250,000 per depositor, some even more. Note that the rates and fee structures for savings accounts are not guaranteed forever; they are subject to change without notice and they often fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. Your earnings depend on any associated fees and the balance you have in your savings account. To open an account, most banks and institutions require a deposit of new money, meaning you can't transfer the money you already had in an account at that bank.

204,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/14/these-oil-stocks-could-be-the-next-takeover-targets-in-permian-basin.html,EOG,EOG Resources,These oil companies could be the next takeover targets in Permian Basin after Diamondback deal,"The oil industry is fighting to cash in on limited land in the resource-rich Permian Basin but the acquisition targets are dwindling after a series of major deals over the past four months. Diamondback Energy took one of the last major, privately held operators in the Permian off the table this week when it agreed to buy Endeavor Energy Resources for $26 billion. The deal is poised to catapult Diamondback into the top tier in the Permian, the most prolific oil patch in the U.S. that stretches from western Texas into southeastern New Mexico. Diamondback will have the third highest net production in the Permian behind only the supermajors Exxon Mobil and Chevron, wrote Matthew Bernstein, senior analyst at Rystad Energy, in a Monday evening note. Wall Street has received the deal warmly so far with Diamondback's stock rising about 9% this week. Truist Securities raised its price target for Diamondback's stock to $250, implying 51% upside over Tuesday's close of $165.60. CRFA Research bumped its target to $185, or about 12% upside. ""In terms of companies that could really move the needle and put a public company into the upper echelon of inventory holders, there's frankly no one to the size of Endeavor left,"" Bernstein told CNBC, referring to private companies that can still be scooped up. Still, the dealmaking is expected to continue in 2024 as dwindling real estate in the Permian puts pressure on companies to snatch what is still up for grabs. Diamondback's deal comes after Exxon agreed to buy Pioneer Natural Resources for nearly $60 billion and Occidental entered a deal to purchase CrownRock for $12 billion last year. The top six companies in the Permian are set to own 62% of the basin's remaining oil reserves, according to Rystad Energy. Chevron has also struck its own megadeal, agreeing to buy Hess for $53 billion in a play that is more focused on production in Guyana. ""There's a limited amount of land in order to do exploration and production, and there's a limited amount of land that actually has the prospects for oil,"" Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, told CNBC. The oil companies are trying to maintain steady shareholder returns for as long as possible, and the way to do that is to have the biggest inventory footprint, said Neal Dingmann, managing director of energy research at Truist Securities. With the big private targets in the Permian largely spoken for, the dealmaking will likely shift to mergers of equals among medium-sized publicly traded producers, energy analysts say. The stubborn holdouts After the Diamondback-Endeavor and Occidental-CrownRock deals, the only other major privately held producers left in the Permian are Continental Resources and Mewbourne Oil. Continental and Mewbourne had a net output of around 486,000 and 272,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, respectively, in 2023, according to Bernstein. But they are tricky targets with Continental having gone private in 2022 to operate without the demands for capital discipline that publicly traded companies face, Bernstein said. And Mewbourne is a tightly held, family-owned company that has not shown interest in selling, Dingmann said. Publicly traded target opportunities Permian Resources , Civitas , Coterra , Vital Energy , and Ovintiv have spent significant capital in scaling up through acquisitions and could seek to take the next step now that they have reached a formidable size, according to Bernstein. They could look to merge with each other or sell to a larger publicly traded producer, he said. Devon Energy held preliminary talks with Marathon Oil last year on a potential combination, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News at the time. ""Devon and Marathon makes strategic sense,"" said Bernstein. ""They are similar in the fact that they have these very large diversified portfolios across the lower 48."" More recently, however, Devon is said to have approached the Canadian producer Enerplus , according to Reuters. Enerplus has a $3.2 billion market cap and operates more in the Bakken Basin in North Dakota. ""It's almost like a free for all,"" Jonnathan Handshoe, an analyst with CFRA Research, said of the recent the dealmaking activity. Potential buyers In terms of possible buyers, majors such as Exxon, Chevron and Occidental are currently digesting their big ticket deals. ConocoPhillips , however, has been conspicuously absent from the recent activity, said Bob Yawger, managing director and energy futures strategist of Mizuho Americas. ""It might be because they're hunting bigger game that takes longer to wrap up,"" Yawger said. Conoco with its $109 billion market cap would need a big deal to move the needle, he said. Devon, Marathon and Conoco officials weren't immediately available to comment on their acquisition strategy when CNBC reached out. ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call earlier this month that the industry needs consolidation and he expects to see more deals. But Lance has said in the past that Conoco sets a high bar for mergers and acquisitions. Conoco could potentially seek to acquire Permian Resources , Civitas , Coterra, Vital Energy or Ovintiv , Bernstein said. But Yawger said Marathon Oil, or even EOG Resources with its nearly $65 billion market cap, would do more to move Conoco forward. EOG, however, has remained more focused on growing through exploration rather than making big deals, according to Dingmann. Conoco is the only company other than Exxon and Chevron, which are closing major acquisitions, that could finance a deal with EOG, Bernstein said. Still, it would be a major move that is unlikely to happen at this time though nothing can be ruled out, he said. ""If they bought EOG, they would be right up there with Exxon just in terms of Permian inventory, and then also hold a higher inventory outside of the basin itself and in the whole lower 48,"" Bernstein said. ""It wouldn't be the most outlandish assessment out there.""",2/14/2024,0,0.037704069,0.660159886,0.004433013,0.252739251,0.041835796,0.003127992

If it's anxiety or jealousy, you might suffer from a zero-sum bias, says Amanda Montell, author of the new book ""The Age of Magical Overthinking.""

Zero-sum bias, or zero-sum thinking, refers to the mistaken belief that another person's gain is your loss.

This, Montell says, can cause a strain in your relationships and feed negative thoughts regarding your worth.

""Another person's light doesn't have to inherently dim you,"" she says.

To curb sentiments of envy, Montell suggests befriending a person whose success you find aspirational.

""Make a connection rather than an enemy,"" she says. ""It ends up alleviating so much suffering.""",4/16/2024,0,0.043489624,0.57809341,0.003512887,0.199751973,0.172067076,0.003085031

Mineral rights grant the bearer permission to exploit underground resources like oil, natural gas, precious metals and rare earth elements.



Depending on the property, these rights may be separate from ownership of the surface territory.

Mineral rights vs. surface rights

Surface rights apply to land used for residential, agricultural or commercial purposes. Despite their name, surface rights can extend dozens of feet below the ground. ""Depending on your jurisdiction, they can extend to a certain depth for a septic system or water well,"" said Jeffrey Yourkovich, a certified public accountant and mineral manager in Wheeling, West Virginia. ""They can also extend above your property to a certain height that's not considered navigable airspace."" Mineral rights, on the other hand, are tied to specific natural resources that could be miles underground, like natural gas, oil or coal. When mineral rights and surface rights are linked, it's known as a unified estate. A split or severed estate is when surface rights and mineral rights have been separated. In that situation, you might not have a say in how the minerals beneath your home are exploited. Mineral rights are typically severed in states with a history of mining or oil drilling, including Colorado, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Texas. According to Yourkovich, ownership rights can apply to specific minerals. ""You could sever the oil rights but the natural gas rights would remain with the surface owner,"" he said. Mineral rights can also be fractionalized, allowing someone to retain a partial interest. This may happen when ownership is passed down through a family inheritance with multiple heirs.

What can happen if I don't own the mineral rights on my property?

According to Yourkovich, mineral rights are dominant in the U.S.. ""That means the mineral estate owner has the right to explore, drill, mine and extract natural resources from the subsurface of your property without your permission,"" he said. If someone owns the mineral rights on your property, they can also grant oil and gas leases to other entities. A ""no-surface clause"" in a lease or deed can limit or prohibit access to the surface, but the mineral rights owner or lessee can still reach underground resources through horizontal drilling from another location.

How do I find out if I own the mineral rights to my property?

Whether you're inquiring about your own property or shopping for a new home, the deed is the first place to look to see how mineral rights are divided. You can also contact the country clerk in the area where the property is located and inquire about the sale of any mineral rights. Some states, including North Carolina, require sellers to disclose whether mineral, oil and gas rights for a property are owned by someone else. In other areas, you may need to hire a professional landman or title company to research local records. Should I buy the mineral rights to my property? Whether it's worth pursuing mineral rights really depends on if there are valuable resources under your land. Finding out can require commissioning a geological survey and having it reviewed by a professional, which can be both time-consuming and expensive.



If you live in a part of the country not known for mining or drilling, it's usually not worth the effort. Even so, the issue could arise years later. ""Technology and research are ever-evolving, so we may not even know what other valuable deposits may lie beneath the surface,"" said Yourkovich. ""This can make it difficult to know if mineral rights have any value or not.""

FAQs What are mineral rights? Mineral rights are the ownership rights to natural resources that are underground, such as oil, natural gas and precious metals. Do I own the mineral rights on my property? If the mineral and surface rights are unified, then you own both. If it's a severed or fractional estate, you may not own any of the minerals on your property. How do I know who owns a property's mineral rights? Checking the property deed can indicate who has mineral rights. You can also ask your county clerk to research the chain of title. How much are mineral rights worth? The value of mineral rights varies based on location, presence of underground shale, drilling activity in the area and other factors. Do I need to own the mineral rights to my property? Extracting resources from the ground is a costly and disruptive process. Most properties don't have natural resources worth extracting so owners don't have to worry about buying their mineral rights.

Bottom line

if you live in a state known for its oil, natural gas or coal industry, it may be important to know who owns the mineral rights to your property. If you don't, you could be in for a rude awakening.

207,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/18/how-this-este-lauder-exec-landed-her-dream-c-suite-job-while-pregnant.html,EPAM,EPAM Systems,This first-time mom landed her dream C-suite job while pregnant—and almost said no. What changed her mind,"Nada Noaman became a C-Suite leader at The Estée Lauder Companies just weeks after learning she was pregnant with her first child.

When Nada Noaman landed her dream C-suite job at The Estée Lauder Cos. just hours after finding out she was pregnant, she felt unbridled joy — and panic. ""It was two dreams of mine that I never expected to converge during the same year, much less the same 24-hour window,"" she recalls of April 28, 2022, the day she received her job offer. ""I was shocked … and I immediately knew that it was not going to work."" Noaman, then 44, had undergone multiple rounds of in vitro fertilization, or IVF, with no luck. When a headhunter reached out to her about interviewing for an open role as Estée Lauder's new chief information security officer, she says she didn't think twice about the timing or that the job, based in New York, would require a lot of travel from her home in Los Angeles. ""I accepted that it would be much harder at my age to get pregnant, that it might not be in the cards for me,"" Noaman, now 46, adds. Until she saw two faint blue lines appear on an at-home pregnancy test she took late one night.

Accepting her dream job offer while newly pregnant

One of the first people Noaman told she was pregnant — besides her doctors and husband — was her potential new boss, Michael Smith, Estèe Lauder's chief information officer. ""I told him I was scared, that I had doubts about my ability to do this, but that I really wanted this job, and had I not just gotten this news, it would be a resounding yes,"" Noaman, who is also a senior vice president at Estée Lauder, says. ""I knew telling him would be a risk but I chose to do that in favor of having some transparency, building trust between us, and with the hope that he could help me navigate this hard decision."" Noaman's fears weren't unfounded. Although there are laws protecting pregnant people from discrimination in the hiring process and at work, including the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which went into effect last June, pregnancy discrimination is still common in workplaces across the U.S. Twenty percent of mothers reported experiencing pregnancy discrimination in the workplace, a Morning Consult survey of 2,200 adults found in 2022. Smith, Noaman's would-be boss, reassured her that she could do both — work as CISO and take maternity leave whenever she needed it, even if that was during her first year on the job. ""I could tell that he believed in me, and he had the confidence that I could not only do the job well, but I could do it pregnant and was willing to adjust the timeline and expectations of the role as needed,"" Noaman recalls. She took the job, and started at Estèe Lauder on June 1.

Starting in the C-suite pregnant and returning as a new mom

Noaman, who worked remotely during the last trimester of her pregnancy, decided not to tell most of her co-workers she was pregnant until she got close to her due date. ""I wanted people to build a rapport with me and know that I wasn't going anywhere anytime soon so that by the time I did go on maternity leave, we had a plan and it felt as seamless as possible,"" she says. Noaman did, however, alert her executive assistant and human resources manager, who, along with Smith, helped Noaman adjust her travel schedule and set up a remote office from her home in Los Angeles.

She left for maternity leave in December 2022 and took about six months off, returning to work in the summer of 2023 (Noaman declined to share the date she gave birth). Estée Lauder offers full-time corporate employees in the U.S. up to 20 weeks of paid parental leave at their normal pay. To prepare for maternity leave during her first year in the C-suite, Noaman set up what she calls a ""self-governance committee"" of business leaders within her department to make decisions and lead team meetings on her behalf. She coordinated with Smith to delegate some of her higher-level duties, like leading meetings or dealing with tech emergencies. ""I joined a couple of important meetings with our senior leadership while I was gone but other than that, I was off enjoying time with my husband and our daughter,"" says Noaman. ""Having a solid support system at work and having a clear game plan months ahead of time made all the difference.""

FAQs Can a sole proprietor get a business credit card? A small business owner who is a sole proprietor is eligible for business credit cards. Many business card applications allow you to use your social security number as your business tax ID and don't require you to have an LLC or other complicated business structure. Can I use my EIN to get a business credit card? You can use an Employer Identification Number (EIN) to apply for a business credit card as a sole proprietor. However, most business cards for sole proprietors require a personal guarantee, so reviews of your personal credit history and income are part of the application process. Do business credit card applications verify personal income? Most small business card applications require you to provide your personal income and social security number. The card issuer can use this information to determine your credit limit and whether you can afford the card's monthly payments.

Bottom line

Sole proprietors are eligible for most types of small business credit cards, including cards that earn cash-back, travel rewards and offer no-interest intro periods. You'll usually need a good to excellent credit score to qualify for the most rewarding cards, but if you have a lower credit score, some of the easiest business credit cards to get only require an average or fair credit score.

The difference between nonrenewal and cancellation

A nonrenewal notice is sent shortly before the end of your policy's specified term. Your carrier may decide not to renew your policy for a variety of reasons, from deciding your property is poorly maintained to no longer offering coverage in your area. Cancellation, however, happens while your policy is still active. Depending on the state and the provider, a carrier can cancel your policy for any reason if it's been in force for less than 60 days. After that, there are only a few approved reasons, according to the Insurance Information Institute (III), including nonpayment, fraud or changes to the property that make it uninsurable.

Why your homeowner insurance was nonrenewed

There are several reasons why a provider may decide to issue a nonrenewal notice. You've made too many claims

Your insurance score has dropped

Liability hazards on your property have increased, like an aging roof or HVAC system

Non-covered features have been added, like a trampoline or swimming pool.

You adopted a pet that's excluded from coverage

Your insurer is no longer providing coverage in your area. In states prone to hurricanes and other severe weather, a number of insurance companies have limited or even ceased issuing home insurance: At least a dozen providers have stopped doing business in Florida since 2022, including State Farm. State Farm and Allstate have stopped writing new home insurance policies In California, and other carriers have scaled back in regions plagued by wildfires.

What to do if you get a nonrenewal notice

Carriers must give customers advance notice of a decision not to renew, typically between 30 and 90 days, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). During this period, you can contest the decision or look around for coverage somewhere else. Appeal Most states require an insurer to explain why it's not renewing before it officially drops your policy, according to the Insurance Information Institute (III). If you have addressed the issue or think they made a mistake, reach out to your carrier's consumer affairs division about reconsidering. You may need to present documentation or submit to a home inspection. If that isn't successful, you can also contact your state's insurance department. Shop for another insurer Not being renewed doesn't mean you can't get insurance from another carrier or that you'll have to pay higher premiums. Get quotes from several companies to find the best price and fit. Nationwide is one of the top insurers for customer satisfaction, according to J.D. Power's 2023 Property Claims Satisfaction Study, and it offers numerous discounts, including for bundling, being a first-time homebuyer and installing security, safety or smart-home devices.

How to get homeowners insurance after being dropped

While your carrier will give you some warning that you're being dropped, you should start looking for new coverage right away. Otherwise, a mortgage provider may assign you force-placed insurance, a policy that protects your lender and can cost twice as much as a traditional policy, according to the CFPB.



If you're facing a cancellation or nonrenewal, find out why. If it's something you can fix, like a roof that needs to be repaired, take the necessary steps to keep your current policy. If it's not something you can fix — for example, if you installed a swimming pool and your insurer doesn't cover them — look for companies that do. If coverage was not renewed because the insurer is no longer offering policies in your state, filter your search for carriers that are. You can look on insurance marketplace sites, get information from your state's insurance department or ask your neighbors what carrier they use. If you've received several rejections on the voluntary market, there are also special programs available to insure risky properties. FAIR Plans Many states have Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plans, which allow high-risk homeowners to get coverage if they've been rejected by traditional carriers. Coverage with a FAIR plan is typically more expensive and may cover less, according to the III. Some plans also may require upgrades to electrical or heating systems. To see if you are eligible for a FAIR plan, contact your state's insurance department. HO-8 policy Most standard homeowners insurance plans are HO-3 policies, which cover the home's physical structure, as well as your personal belongings, your liability in the event of an injury and additional living expenses if you have to relocate. An HO-8 policy provides similar coverage but only reimburses you for the actual cash value of the damaged or destroyed property or possessions, not their replacement cost. It's intended for older homes (built more than 40 years ago) or ones with historical significance, where the cost of replacing the loss would be more than the house's fair market value HO-8 policies only cover named perils, typically damage from: Fire, smoke and lightning

Hail and windstorms

Explosions

Civil unrest

Vehicles, including airplanes

Theft or vandalism

Volcanic eruptions Other perils not listed, like water damage from a burst pipe, would not be covered. Surplus lines policy Surplus line insurance is another option if your homeowners policy has been canceled or not renewed. Many states allow insurance companies to issue policies within their borders even if they're not licensed in that state. To qualify for surplus line insurance, you must have been rejected by at least three to five carriers, according to the III. Because the risk is higher, policies usually have higher deductibles and more exclusions. Check with your state's insurance department to see what options are available.

FAQ

FAQs Can I dispute a nonrenewal notice? You can dispute the nonrenewal with your insurance company directly or reach out to your state's department of insurance. Does a notice of nonrenewal mean I'll pay more for insurance in the future? Not necessarily. Each carrier has its own formula for determining costs and approvals and being nonrenewed by one doesn't mean you'll be rejected or have to pay more to another company. How much notice is required if my insurance company is not renewing my policy? Requirements vary by state, but typically an insurer is required to give you at least 30 to 60 days' notice before deciding not to renew. Check with your state's insurance department to see how much notice is required in your area. Can getting a dog lead to nonrenewal of my homeowners insurance? Getting a pet can change your status with an insurance company: Some breeds of dogs — including Doberman pinschers, pit bulls and Great Danes — are considered higher risk and could lead to nonrenewal. If you have to file a claim for a dog bite, you could also face nonrenewal or the dog being excluded from coverage.

Bottom line

If you've received a nonrenewal notice from your insurance company, you have the right to ask why and to appeal the decision. You can also shop around for another policy, whether that's on the voluntary market, a FAIR Plan or coverage from a surplus line provider.

Chipmaker Broadcom is nearing a $3.8 billion deal to sell its business that allows users to access desktops and applications from any device to private-equity firm KKR , people familiar with the matter said on Saturday.

The potential deal represents an effort by Broadcom CEO Hock Tan to streamline the company's portfolio after completing its $69 billion takeover of software maker VMware in November.

KKR prevailed in the auction for the end-user computing (EUC) unit over other private equity firms, including EQT, the sources said.

The deal could be announced as early as Monday, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.

KKR declined to comment. Broadcom and EQT did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Broadcom said in December it would seek to divest its end-user computing unit. It is separately attempting to shed VMware's security software business Carbon Black.

KKR is no stranger to dealmaking in the sector.

In 2018, it purchased U.S. business software company BMC for $8.5 billion and two years later it combined BMC with Compuware, a company it acquired from buyout firm Thoma Bravo.

In 2021, KKR acquired information services technology provider Ensono from private-equity firms Charlesbank Capital Partners and M/C Partners for about $1.7 billion.

Evercore, Deutsche Bank and Jefferies are advising KKR on the transaction, while Citigroup is advising Broadcom, the sources said.

(We're no longer recording the audio, so we can get this new written feature to members as quickly as possible.) Momentum fading?: The S & P 500 is on track for slight losses Monday, but stocks are well off their lows of the session. Concerns about Friday's intraday reversal in leading artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia — which traded 5% higher before closing down 5% — extended into the new week. Many observers are arguing that some pockets of the market, mainly in the AI trade, have moved too far, too fast and are ripe for pullbacks. Nvidia, a longtime Club holding, fell 1.5% Monday. Last week, we cautioned around what we perceived as toppy behavior , contending it would be healthy for the market to shakeout some of its excess froth. Given these concerns, we would not be surprised to see more choppiness ahead and pullbacks like we're seeing Monday play out more frequently over the next few weeks. That may create better buying opportunities for those with patience and willing to pass on the ""first dip."" Sectors leading: Materials is the top-performing sector Monday. Some of that is tied to Club holding Linde , which climbed more than 1% on news it will be added to the Nasdaq 100 index later this month. However, the strength is mostly in some of the group's laggards like Albemarle , Newmont , FMC Corp . and International Flavors & Fragrances . The No. 2 performing sector Monday is consumer staples, and the move higher in the group makes sense to us. If investors are fearing momentum and selling stocks with extended, parabolic charts, it's likely some of that money will find its way into more stable names that pay solid dividends. Club consumer staple Procter & Gamble , which was upgraded to buy from hold by Truist, added about 0.7%. Energy is higher despite being weighed down by EQT Corp. 's acquisition-related decline. Sectors lagging: Meanwhile, industrials on Monday are at the bottom of the S & P 500. Some of this underperformance has to do with Boeing falling on reports of a new Department of Justice probe into the Alaska Airlines door blowout, but there's also profit-taking afoot in recent winners like housing-linked Builders FirstSource and Howmet Aerospace . Tech also is having a rough day as the recent rallies in semiconductor stocks like Nvidia and software names lose steam. Later: Earnings from tech giant Oracle will give us the latest read on the data center market and cloud spending environment. Tuesday is a busy day with earnings from shoe maker On Holding and retailer Kohl's , as well as the the February consumer price index report before the bell, which will provide the latest look at U.S. inflation. Meanwhile, we'll be keeping an eye on Club holding GE Healthcare's appearance Tuesday at Oppenheimer's MedTech and Services conference.

Layoffs, flight cuts and store closures

Shifting patterns

Industry experts have chalked up some recent cuts to companies catching their breath — and taking a hard look at how they operate — after an unusual four-year stretch caused by the pandemic and its fallout. EY's Daco said the past few years have been marked by a mismatch in supply and demand when it comes to goods, services and even workers. Customers went on shopping sprees, fueled by government stimulus and less experience-related spending. Airlines saw demand disappear and then skyrocket. Companies furloughed workers in the early pandemic and then struggled to fill jobs. He said he expects companies this year to ""search for an equilibrium."" ""You're seeing a rebalancing happening in the labor markets, in the capital markets,"" he said. ""And that rebalancing is still going to play out and gradually lead to a more sustainable environment of lower inflation and lower interest rates, and perhaps a little bit slower growth."" The auto industry, for example, faced a supply issue during much of the Covid pandemic but is now facing a potential demand problem. Inventories of new vehicles are rising — surpassing 2.5 million units and 71 days' supply toward the end of 2023, up 57% year over year, according to Cox Automotive — forcing automakers to extend more discounts to move cars and trucks off dealer lots. Automakers have also been contending with slower-than-expected adoption of EVs. David Silverman, a retail analyst at Fitch Ratings, said companies are ""feeling a bit heavy as sales growth moderates and maybe even declines."" Cost cuts at UPS, Hasbro and Levi all followed sales declines in the most recent fiscal quarter. Macy's, which reports earnings later this month, has said it expects same-store sales to drop, and there's early evidence that may come to bear: Consumers pulled back on spending in January, with retail sales falling 0.8%, more than economists expected, according to the latest federal data. Most major retailers, including Walmart, Target and Home Depot, will report earnings in the coming weeks. Credit ratings agency Fitch said it doesn't expect the U.S. economy to tip into recession, but it does anticipate a continued pullback in discretionary spending. ""Part of companies' decision to lower their expense structure is in line with their views that 2024 may not be a fantastic year from a top-line-growth standpoint,"" Silverman said. Plus, he added, companies have had to find cash to fund investments in newer technology such as infrastructure that supports e-commerce, a resilient supply chain or investments in artificial intelligence.

We're no longer recording the audio, so we can get this new written feature to members as quickly as possible. Here's Monday's edition. Off the lows : The week got off to a slower start but stocks Monday afternoon were well off their lowest levels of the session. The story of the day may be in the bond market, where yields are surging on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's interest rate cut comments on ""60 Minutes"" amid ongoing strong economic data. Our Significant Six stocks were having a mixed day. Nvidia surged to yet another all-time high, while Amazon and Meta Platforms gave back some of last Friday's big gains. Believe it or not, Apple shares rose Monday — now higher than where they traded ahead of last Thursday's earnings. Alphabet was up after underperforming last week. Microsoft was down. ""Microsoft is the one to buy first on weakness due to the quality of last week's quarter and outlook,"" Jim Cramer said Monday. Show-me story : Shares of prestige beauty company Estee Lauder were up more than 12% in reaction to earnings but off session highs. Here's what Jim and I need to see next to upgrade our 4 rating on the stock. It's certainly a show-me story. ""Reduction in the workforce is a positive step in addressing costs, but our next question is how are they going to recover brand equity after shoving so much inventory through travel and retail and then dumping it at bargain prices,"" Cramer said. Sector leaders : Information Technology was the leader Monday, thanks to continued strength in the semiconductor stocks. More analyst love for Nvidia and not-as-bad-as-feared earnings from On Semiconductor were boosting the group. Health care was up thanks to a big move in its largest weighting: Club name Eli Lilly . Earlier Monday, Novo Nordisk announced it will acquire the contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) Catalent in what looks like a strong sign of future demand for GLP-1 obesity and diabetes drugs. Both Lilly and Novo Nordisk rose to new all-time highs as they have the market cornered on these treatments. Energy was being helped by a roughly 1% gain in oil prices . Recently volatile natural gas prices, however, were weaker. Sector laggards : Materials were the worst-performing sector and the group has been the second worst performer year to date — down more than 5%. Monday's blow-up was Air Products and Chemicals . Shares fell nearly 15% after the industrial gas company lowered its full-year adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) outlook, citing weakness in China and lower helium demand, among other reasons. Air Products' slashed outlook may raise some concerns going into Club name Linde 's earnings Tuesday morning, though the latter is much higher quality of a company. ""Air Products has nothing to do with Linde. It is awful and has real issues. Linde is the much better operator."" Jim said. Consumer Discretionary was off 2%, weighed down by continued weakness in Tesla and a post-earnings pullback in McDonald's . Interest-rate-sensitive areas like utilities and real estate were struggling with bond yields higher. Earnings continue: No portfolio names reporting after the bell Monday but some names of interest are Palantir , Vertex Pharmaceuticals , Simon Property Group , and NXP Semiconductors . But get ready for a busy Tuesday morning, in addition to Eli Lilly and Linde, fellow Club names GE Healthcare and DuPont are on the docket. Other companies of interest Fiserv , Spotify , Spirit Aerosystems , Check Point Software , Carrier Global , and Jacobs Solutions . After the closing bell Tuesday, Club name Ford reports.

Shares of Ralph Lauren rallied 14% after the premium apparel, accessories, and fragrance company delivered an upbeat quarter before the opening bell Thursday. The company reported strong revenue across its regions, led by Asia, while its operating margins did better than expected. Ralph Lauren attributes its quarterly success to consumers' continued appetite for the brand following a strong holiday shopping season as well as expense discipline and scaling of the business. ""Don't just take this pop"" in Ralph Lauren, Cramer said Thursday. ""I think it goes higher"" from here, he added. Shares have gained 16% year to date.

It's an apparel category that has ""staying power"" for its great direct-to-consumer and exposure to many different markets,"" he explained. Cramer highlighted how the company's sales in China were great, a change in tune in the industry as other luxury retail brands have been struggling to recover in a post-pandemic environment in the world's second-largest economy. Estee Lauder , a company in the CNBC Investing Club stock portfolio, has been struggling in China. But its latest quarter showed signs of a turn .

216,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/10/5-things-next-week-that-could-determine-if-wall-street-win-streak-continues.html,EL,Estee Lauder Companies (The),5 things next week that could determine if Wall Street's winning streak continues,"Wall Street wrapped up another positive week, with the S & P 500 closing Friday above 5,000 for the first time ever. The Nasdaq finished less than 0.5% away from its November 2021 record-high close. It was another big week for Club company earnings, with Estee Lauder , Eli Lilly , GE Healthcare , DuPont , Linde , Ford , Disney and Wynn Resorts all reporting. Twenty-one of our 32 portfolio names have now delivered their results this quarter. Looking more broadly, according to FactSet, three-quarters of the 67% of S & P 500 companies that have issued their numbers reported upside earnings surprises, while just about two-thirds reported better-than-expected revenue. It was a pretty light week in terms of economic data releases, though we did get a favorable ISM Services number on Monday. Things will pick up next week with several closely watched macroeconomic updates, including two key government inflation reports. While no Club earnings are scheduled to report earnings in the week ahead, 61 companies in the S & P 500 will deliver their latest quarterly results. 1. Consumer inflation: The main event of the week will come on Tuesday when the January consumer price index (CPI) is released. Economists are looking for headline CPI to advance 2.9% year over year and core CPI, including food and energy prices, to gain 3.8%. While the core PCE (personal consumption expenditure) price index is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, CPI will provide valuable insight into what areas of the economy are seeing sticker price pressures. That, in turn, can help forecast whether there's any chance for a March interest rate cut. Right now, the market odds favor a Fed rate reduction in May or June. A cooler core CPI print, closer to the Fed's 2% target inflation rate, would likely be taken as a positive by the stock market. Really weak data could be less well received on the thought the Fed held rates high for too long. We, however, do not believe the latter to be the case. 2. Wholesale inflation: The January producer price index (PPI) is out on Friday. Economists are looking for a year-over-year headline PPI increase of 0.6%. The CPI carries more weight because it reflects the prices consumers pay. Price stability and maximizing employment are the two pillars of the Fed's dual mandate. However, PPI is important because it provides insight into input costs that companies pay. A greater-than-expected rise in input costs could lead to companies trying to protect profits by passing those higher costs through to consumers, which would be a negative in terms of getting the rate of inflation down. 3. Retail sales: January retail sales are on Thursday. While this report doesn't provide nearly as much insight into the rate of inflation as CPI, it is a gauge of consumer health. That's because nearly 70% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), or economic growth, is based on private consumption. If the economy is going to avoid a recession (and we think it will), we need to see consumer spending and shopping remain relatively resilient. Economists are expecting a 0.1% monthly decline, not too surprising given the comp for a January monthly reading is December, which is the last month of the holiday shopping season. 4. Other data: January's industrial production and capacity utilization report is also released on Thursday, and the January housing starts and building permits report is out on Friday. The former will provide insight into the state of manufacturing, which provides indirect insight into the health of consumer and business demand. The latter, however, is likely to garner more attention as an ongoing shortage of houses remains a key factor keeping prices high. Shelter costs are a real thorn in the Fed's side because they represent large, unavoidable cost for Americans. Anything that points to more housing supply coming online should be taken as a positive. 5. Earnings: We get a break from Club earnings next week. But things will pick back up for our portfolio names the following week. That's when Palo Alto Networks , Nvidia , Coterra Energ y and Bausch Health report. However, between now and then, there are tons of releases from non-portfolio companies to monitor for a better understanding of industry dynamics and the economy overall. As important as macroeconomic updates are, they're backward-looking and extremely high-level. Earnings releases, on the other, hand provide more up-to-date information. The reported numbers may be backward-looking but the information management teams share on their post-earnings conference calls are real-time and often provide insight as to what is currently happening on the ground.

217,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/30/worlds-largest-sovereign-wealth-fund-posts-record-213-billion-profit.html,EG,Everest Re,"World's largest sovereign wealth fund posts record $213 billion profit, boosted by tech stocks","Norway's giant sovereign wealth fund on Tuesday reported record profit of 2.22 trillion kroner ($213 billion) in 2023, supported by robust returns on its investments in technology stocks.

The so-called Government Pension Fund Global, one of the world's largest investors, said the result marked its highest return in kroner ever, with the fund's return on investment last year coming in at 16.1% for the year. That was 18 basis points lower than the return on the fund's benchmark index.

It follows a record loss of 1.64 trillion kroner for the whole of 2022, which the fund attributed to ""very unusual"" market conditions at the time.

""Despite high inflation and geopolitical turmoil, the equity market in 2023 was very strong, compared to a weak year in 2022,"" Nicolai Tangen, chief executive of Norges Bank Investment Management, said in a statement.

""Technology stocks in particular performed very well,"" he added.

Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, was established in the 1990s to invest the surplus revenues of the country's oil and gas sector. To date, the fund has put money in more than 8,500 companies in 70 countries around the world.

Last year, Norges Bank Investment Management said its return on equity investments was 21.3%, its return on fixed income investments came in at 6.1%, while investments in unlisted real estate returned -12.4%.

The fund said a negative year for its unlisted real estate investments was due to rising interest rates and subdued demand.

The fund returned 3.7% on investments in unlisted renewable energy infrastructure in 2023.

At the end of last year, Norges Bank Investment Management said nearly 71% of the fund was invested in equities, 27.1% in fixed income, 1.9% in unlisted real estate and 0.1% in unlisted renewable energy infrastructure.

When asked at a news conference about the geopolitical issues likely to affect stocks in 2024, Norges Bank Investment Management's Tangen replied, ""The thing is that you have geopolitical hotspots in a lot of places these days.""

""So, what are the ones that we need to look out for? Well, the tension between America and China is negative for economic growth and world trade. The fact that people are nearshoring more and moving production closer to home is an inflationary force,"" he continued.

""We are seeing the effect of the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East through longer trading routes [and] higher freight costs. So, that's negative. And, of course, the most scary geopolitical situations are the ones that you don't know about, that haven't happened yet.""

Correction: At the end of last year, Norges Bank Investment Management said nearly 71% of the fund was invested in equities. An earlier version mischaracterized the percentage change.",1/30/2024,2,0.000762484,0.996434093,0.00051342,0.000914862,0.000789581,0.000585568
218,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/02/wall-street-heads-into-the-week-ahead-as-traders-worry-the-rally-is-running-out-of-steam.html,EG,Everest Re,Wall Street heads into the week ahead worrying the rally to record highs is running out of steam,"Wall Street continues to climb a wall of worry even as investors deliberate how much longer equities can maintain their record run. The stock rally continued on Friday , with the major averages each advancing more than 1% for the week, buoyed by strong results from Meta and Amazon, as well as a slate of recent reports pointing to a healthy and growing U.S. economy . But questions remain for investors after some major disappointments in an intense week suggested more challenges ahead. Stocks tumbled Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said a March rate cut is unlikely ; the S & P 500 posted its worst day since September following the statement. Apple dropped more than 3% this week after reporting lackluster earnings, weighing on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Elsewhere in corporate earnings, regional banks as represented by the SPDR S & P Regional Banking ETF slid 7% this week after poor results from New York Community Bank spurred investor fears of a wider contagion. NYCB shares tumbled 42% for the week. ""The pain trade is now lower, not higher from here,"" Scott Rubner, managing director at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a Thursday note. ""We have all-time high problems for the US equity market and the bar is simply too high in February."" ""'If we go down a little, we could go down a lot' – I like adding February equity hedges and will fade this green pre-market bounce,"" Rubner added. Signs of market weakness For investors, there may be more issues in the market going forward in 2024. While investors came into the year anticipating a broadening of the rally, small caps have thus far underperformed to start the year. The Russell 2000 is down by more than 3% in 2024, while the S & P 500 is higher by more than 3%. Small-caps are likely to suffer further going forward from the impact of higher for longer interest rates. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, told CNBC's ""Money Movers"" on Friday that zombie companies, to which the Russell 2000 has a higher exposure, are more likely to crumble now that the prospect of lower rates have moved out to the latter part of the year. ""We can't look at sort of the market in a monolithic way anymore,"" Sonders said. ""I think expectations around Fed policy moves in yields seem to be having, probably rightly so, a disproportionate impact down the cap spectrum."" There are also troubles in the regional banking sector after NYCB, which took over the failed Signature Bank last year during the regional banking crisis, reported a fourth-quarter loss that shocked investors. ""I still think that this commercial real estate problem is very much in through the windshield, not the rearview mirror, but there's different maturity schedules, there's different exposures within commercial real estate,"" Sonders said."" ""It's more of a slow motion train wreck or a simmering crisis over time, as opposed to sort of a Lehman-esque problem where there's going to be some announcement and the bottom falls out."" For stock pickers looking for opportunities in the wreckages, she advised going through the sector with a fine-toothed comb. There's a growing disparity in mega-caps as well. On Friday, Raymond James called ""MnM? Microsoft, Nvidia & *now* Meta Leading in AI Era,"" the hottest new portfolio of mega-cap tech stocks, replacing the ""Magnificent Seven"" that dominated markets so completely last year. Analyst Josh Beck turned especially bullish on Meta Platforms after the social media company's strong quarterly results, as well as its first ever dividend payment. However, other mega-cap companies such as Apple have taken a backseat, with the iPhone maker reporting a 13% drop in sales in China. Some investors also continue to worry about a recession on the horizon even if weakness is not surfacing immediately in the economic data. James McCann, deputy chief economist at asset manager Abrdn, said he expects the long and variable lags of interest rate hikes will make themselves felt in the broader economy eventually, and he expects a hard landing in the second half of the year. ""If we're right that a recession, that a mild recession is coming, then I think there's a decent chance that equities would struggle in that environment,"" McCann said. Stronger economic data Regardless, however, Rhys WIlliams, portfolio manager at Wayve Capital Management, said he expects markets can still continue churning higher, so long as some mega-cap companies continue to outperform. On Friday, for example, the sharp gains in Amazon and Meta helped outweigh any muted losses in Apple, as well as even any declines in their respective sectors. ""As long as these major companies that are both large and defensive, to some extent, stay positive, the whole market can stay positive. You don't really need to broaden out for the whole market to do OK as defined by the index,"" Williams said. ""However, it's not going to be the runaway market that November and December was."" More broadly speaking, Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial, expects that stronger economic data will continue to be a positive for stocks, with first-quarter GDP tracking at a 4.2% increase, up from 3% previously, according to the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker. He also said rate cuts will boost equities, even if expectations for the first one are moved out past March. ""We no longer live in the fear that any economic data is going to show up that is so strong that it forces the Fed to raise rates again. They're at the high point of the tightening cycle,"" Hogan said. ""So, while we can quibble over the 'when,' we know 'what' they're going to do next, and that is a tailwind. That is a headwind from '23 turned into a tailwind in 2024.""

219,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/01/cloud-back-at-amazon-putting-stock-on-a-path-back-to-covid-era-record-highs.html,EG,Everest Re,"The cloud is back at Amazon, putting the stock on a path back to Covid-era record highs","Amazon shares jumped after-hours Thursday, following the e-commerce and cloud computing giant's strong fourth quarter. Results like this happen when Amazon shifts its mindset from an ""investing"" cycle to a ""harvesting"" phase, which usually leads to big profit numbers like what we saw in the quarterly print and what was forecasted in the future. Revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $169.96 billion, beating expectations for $166.21 billion, according to estimates compiled by LSEG, formerly Refinitiv. Earnings-per-share (EPS) on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) increased to $1, compared with 3 cents last year and the 80-cent estimate. Operating income increased over 383% to $13.21 billion, significantly exceeding forecasts of $10.4 billion, according to FactSet, and above the high-end of management's previous guidance of $11 billion. Bottom line Well, well, well. Would you look at the quarter Amazon just delivered. Expectations were high going into earnings — considering the stock's 81% rise in 2023 and a strong start to 2024 — and Amazon checked the boxes of exactly what the bulls wanted to see. One of the main highlights came from its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), where revenue growth finally accelerated. Throughout last year we had hoped this would happen by Amazon's fourth quarter, so we're pleased to see this achievement. Better yet, management's comment about how it expects accelerating AWS revenue trends to continue through 2024 should keep the bulls happy. Amazon has also fully gained control of its expenses. Whether through finally growing into its huge fulfillment center network that swelled during Covid and more recent last-mile logistics expansions, ongoing efficiency initiatives, or inflationary factors finally easing, the company has delivered serious progress on margins. We look forward to seeing how management's goal of further reducing costs to serve its e-commerce business plays out in the years ahead. AMZN 1Y mountain Amazon 1 year Thanks to its 7% jump to $170 per share, the stock is finally closing in on its Covid-era highs of the mid-$180s. If the AWS revenue growth acceleration continues and the company continues its progress on expanding margins, the stock should get back there. To that end, we're increasing our price target to $190 per share from $160. Quarterly commentary It was a quarter of near-universal beats, and that's pretty much all you can ask for. Sure, total expenses at $156.75 billion in Q4 were higher than expected and up 7% from the year-ago period, but that's a function of the stronger revenue. The impressive part here was on margins, where in North America it expanded to 6%, up from about 5% in the third quarter and about 2% for all of last year. Margins in the region have now improved for seven consecutive quarters off the lows of the first quarter of 2022, which logged a negative 0.26%, as seen in the Regions part of the earnings table below. On revenue, the long-awaited acceleration in AWS happened with sales increasing 13.2% to $24.2 billion in the quarter. Growth here may not be as fast as Microsoft 's Azure, which just reported a 30% increase in revenue, but AWS is working off a much higher base. Driving this accelerating revenue growth was an increase in larger new deals while the cost optimization headwind ""continued to attenuate,"" the company said. Revenue from generative artificial intelligence accelerated as well, helping the backlog grow to $155.7 billion, up more than $45 billion from last year and up $20 billion from the third quarter. Profitability was a bright spot too, with AWS' operating margin expanding almost to 30% from just over 24% a year ago, thanks to headcount reduction and a slowdown in the pace of hiring. Online sales increased 9% to $70.54 billion, boosted by a strong holiday season that featured the Prime member exclusive Big Deal Days event and continued into the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping events, which turned out to be Amazon's largest event ever. Amazon said these events helped bring in new customers and Prime members. In addition to competitive prices, speed is a big reason for Amazon's e-commerce success and 2023 was the fastest year ever for delivery to Prime members. There are two reasons for this: the expansion of same-day facilities and Amazon's regionalization initiative. The latter has been most impactful to the company's broader results as it also helps drive costs down. In fact, in this past year, Amazon reduced its cost-to-serve on a per-unit basis globally for the first time since 2018. Management said this evening it thinks it can lower its cost to serve even more in 2024. Advertising revenue, which mostly comes from sponsored ads, grew much faster than expected at 27% to $14.65 billion versus estimates closer to 22% growth. Future quarters will get a boost from the recent addition of ads on Prime Video. If you want to skip the ads, the extra $2.99 per month fee will flow into Subscription Services, which was also better than expected with 14% sales growth to $10.49 billion. It sounds like Thursday Night Football has been a huge success with the number of people watching growing by 24% year over year and gains in ad sales. Guidance Amazon expects first-quarter net sales to be between $138 billion to $143.5 billion, growing 8% to 13% year over year. Interestingly, the dollar has switched from foe to friend because this guide anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 40 basis points from foreign exchange rates. But the key thing is that this outlook brackets consensus estimates of $142 billion. The operating income estimate should catch attention, as Amazon said it expects to deliver between $8 billion and $12 billion in operating profits, which at its midpoint of $10 billion was well above estimates of $8.9 billion. It also puts margin at around 7% compared to estimates of 6.3% and 3.75% in the first quarter of 2023. There's a small caveat here. Amazon said the guide includes a benefit of $900 million from lower depreciation expense due to an increase in the estimated useful life of servers. However, it would still be a beat even if you backed that out. One thing to keep in mind, Amazon historically guides conservatively and posts operating income at least toward the high end of its guidance range. If you need proof, look no further than this quarter. Amazon originally guided fourth-quarter operating income to between $7 billion and $11 billion and just delivered $13.2 billion in operating profits.

Revenue jumped 25% in the quarter from $32.2 billion a year earlier, the fastest rate of growth for any period since mid-2021, as the online ad market continued to rebound. Meanwhile, the company's expenses decreased 8% year over year to $23.73 billion, and its operating margin more than doubled to 41%, a clear sign that cost-cutting measures are bolstering profitability.

Net income more than tripled to $14 billion, or $5.33 per share, from $4.65 billion, or $1.76 per share, a year earlier.

Meta said it will pay investors a dividend of 50 cents a share on March 26. That comes after cash and equivalents swelled to $65.4 billion at the end of 2023 from $40.7 billion a year earlier. The company also announced a $50 billion share buyback.

The after-hours market jump continues a rally from 2023, when the stock almost tripled. It hit a record in January and was up 12% this year prior to the earnings report. Based on its late-trading price, Meta's market cap has swelled to almost $1.2 trillion.

Sales in Meta's Reality Labs unit passed $1 billion in the quarter, though the virtual reality unit recorded $4.65 billion in losses.

AMD and Nvidia hit all-time highs on Thursday as investors continue to clamor for shares of the companies building chips that power artificial intelligence.

AMD shares rose over 1% during trading on Thursday to reach its highest-ever closing price, $162.67, while Nvidia, rose just under 2% to $571.07. Both companies have notched double-digit percentage gains to start the year after an explosive 2023 in which AMD shares popped 127.6% and Nvidia stock rocketed 238.8%.

The record valuations reflect continued investor interest and hunger for companies that design and sell graphics processors for artificial intelligence. GPUs were originally designed to play computer games,. But they're also essential for training and deploying intricate AI models like OpenAI's GPT, leading to a massive surge in sales for the chips.

Nvidia has been the primary GPU supplier to AI companies for the past two years and was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 last year.

Investors are increasingly bullish on AMD, the second-largest standalone GPU maker. the company announced last year a new chip that could compete with Nvidia's H100, which is currently the standard for AI applications.

Analysts also see AMD improving its AI software, eliminating one major reason why Nvidia chips were preferred over AMD's.

On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company , which manufactures Nvidia and AMD chips, reported better-than-expected sales. CEO C.C. Wei said that there was strong demand for AI chips, which use the most advanced manufacturing techniques.

TSMC management believes manufacturing AI chips could represent a ""high-teens"" percentage of its revenue in five years, which has positive implications for both Nvidia and AMD, Goldman Sachs analysts led by Toshiya Hari wrote in a note on Thursday.

Separately, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, one of the largest buyers of GPUs, announced plans on Thursday to buy billions of dollars worth of Nvidia and other GPUs this year.",1/18/2024,2,0.01529936,0.767001808,0.004695393,0.171343684,0.037774947,0.003884821

The battle to win the Republican Iowa caucus is the most expensive on record, with over $120 million spent on ads by the campaigns and their affiliated political action committees in the Hawkeye State, according to data provided to CNBC by AdImpact.

The massive amount of resources placed into Iowa reflects how competitive candidates and their allies still believe the GOP nomination race to be, despite Donald Trump's dominance in the polls. Going into Monday's caucus, Trump's lead over his closest rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, averaged 33 percentage points, according to a Real Clear Politics polling aggregation.

Around $84 million of the $120 million total ad buys came from campaigns and allies of the top three candidates, Trump, Haley and Florida. Gov. Ron DeSantis, according to the data. The figure includes television, radio and digital spots.

Among the top three, Haley and her allies have spent the most: $37 million in Iowa alone.

Despite Haley's advantage in the Iowa ad spending wars, Trump is clearly not taking his massive polling lead for for granted, however.

Together, the former president's campaign and the outside group supporting him, Make America Great Again Inc., have aired around 21,000 TV ads this cycle. This is roughly equivalent to the 22,000 spots the Haley team has paid to broadcast, according to data by Wesleyan Media Project, reviewed by CNBC.

""Judging by the number of ads placed in Iowa and New Hampshire, Trump's campaign is not taking those states for granted,"" Michael Franz, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, said in a statement released with the report.

Haley and DeSantis' allied groups in Iowa are paying for more than just ads.

Americans for Prosperity Action, a super PAC backing Haley and financed in part by billionaire Charles Koch, said they planned to knock on 50,000 doors in the eight days between Jan. 7 and Iowa Caucus day.

The group told CNBC they have more than 150 staff and volunteers throughout the Hawkeye State, working to build support for Haley. In addition to the volunteers, AFP Action has spent over $900,000 on pro-Haley ads targeting Iowa voters, according AdImpact.

Nonetheless, the group appeared to be managing their expectations for Monday night.

""While Iowa and New Hampshire are important, we're building for the long-term. We're already up with advertising and one-on-one grassroots outreach in South Carolina and a number of Super Tuesday states,"" Bill Riggs, a spokesman for Americans for Prosperity Action, told CNBC in an email.

""The DeSantis team has made clear they need Iowa to survive. Our goal is to help Nikki Haley finish strong and keep the momentum going into New Hampshire,"" said Riggs.

DeSantis' campaign and two outside allies have spent a combined $30 million on TV, digital, and radio ads in Iowa. But they have also been active in door knocking and engaging with voters in Iowa.

One of the two DeSantis super PACs, Never Back Down, has knocked on over 915,000 doors in the Iowa, according to the organization.

As for Trump's super PAC, MAGA Inc. would not provide data on what efforts they've made outside of their ad spending in support of the former president.

""We'll leave the pre-election backslapping to others,"" Taylor Budowich, the head of the super PAC, told CNBC. ""I have no interest in telegraphing strategic or tactical efforts to the media.""",1/15/2024,-1,0.025456246,0.636002541,0.004665082,0.315025806,0.015834218,0.003016082

FAQs What is a second-chance bank account? A second-chance bank account is a type of bank account that's available for consumers who have had issues with overdrafts or other negative banking activity. This type of account typically doesn't require a ChexSystems report review. What is ChexSystems? ChexSystems is a reporting agency that collects information about consumer banking activity. Banks and credit unions will often review your ChexSystems report when you apply for accounts such as checking or savings accounts. Can you open a bank account if you have a negative balance at another bank? If you have an unpaid negative account balance with one bank, it can hurt your chances of being approved for an account with a different bank. This is because this information will appear on your consumer report with agencies such as ChexSystems. In this situation, you may want to consider a second chance bank account that doesn't require a ChexSystems review as part of the application.

Bottom line

If you struggled with overdraft charges, bounced checks or negative bank account balances, you're likely to have a hard time getting approved for a new bank account. However, second-chance accounts provide an opportunity for a fresh start. There are even second-chance checking accounts available with no overdraft fees, no monthly fees and no minimum balance requirements.

After the characters and the stakes of a story are established in the first act, things can get a bit messy and confusing as the central conflict is escalated before pushing toward an ultimate resolution. The markets have entered such a muddled middle phase after a first quarter in which the plot lines were neat and tidy and the rally free of complications. The first act of 2024 had the consensus embrace a story of brisk economic growth, a strong and rebalancing labor market, ebbing inflation, an upswing in earnings growth, repeated record highs in stock prices and the prospect of a Federal Reserve looking to trim rates into all this. Much of this remains either true or plausible, still. Yet a third straight warmer-than-expected CPI reading last week reawakened bond-market volatility, gave an extra push to a revived reflation-asset trade and resurfaced concerns that imperfect tradeoffs might need to be made among growth, inflation, valuation and Fed policy. The result was a 1.5-percent weekly drop in the S & P 500 , with Friday's setback exacerbated at least somewhat by a collective clenching-up of risk markets on some geopolitical worry. Rally tested A week after the S & P ended its first 2% dip in more than five months, an early hint of a potential change in market character , the index retreated to touch its 50-day moving average for the first time since November. It did, however, bounce off that line to close above it for the 110 th straight session, according to Bespoke, making it one of the dozen or so longest such streaks in the past 80 years. Consider this test of the rally's resilience ongoing rather than settled. I've repeatedly said this has not principally been a Fed-driven market, in the sense that it didn't ""need"" rate cuts to happen soon or to be deep in order to stay supported given the otherwise sturdy macro. This doesn't mean the market could easily shrug off the circumstances under which the Fed would retreat from its easing bias altogether this year. That's because the Fed merely needs inflation to settle down just a bit — even in a still-strong economy — in order to punctuate the tightening cycle with a ""normalization"" cut or two. So, if there are no cuts, it means inflation will be more stubborn, which probably means longer-term yields would keep threatening to pinch equity progress. Remember, the pivot toward an easing bias by Chair Jerome Powell late last year was so avidly embraced by the market because it meant the Fed no longer saw the need to smother growth in order to suppress inflation. Before then, Powell was routinely saying the economy needed to run ""below potential for a sustained period"" to corral inflation. He would frequently point out that services-sector inflation was really about wage growth, so the job market might need to soften up a lot to drag down prices there. This is why the appreciable drop in inflation by November — a steeper decline than the Fed had been forecasting — immediately freed Wall Street to treat good economic news as good news for stocks. This dynamic hasn't been reversed, but the signal has grown a bit staticky, draining some conviction from the macro bullish case with the S & P 500 still 24% above the October low. Jumping yields, gold The jumpiness in the bond market manifests some of this dissonance. The ICE BofA MOVE Index , the VIX of the Treasury market, so to speak, bottomed at a two-year low on March 28, the date of the last all-time high in the S & P 500, and has shot higher since as the 10-year yield vaulted 4.5%, before settling a bit with that geopolitical bid on Friday. .MOVE 5Y mountain ICE BofAML MOVE Index, 5 years A torrent of hedging activity also washed over the equity-option and VIX futures market, a sign that traders are eager to pay up to protect gains. Gold has gone nearly vertical this month, with stupendous volumes in the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) ETF Friday just as the gold price put in a possible short-term buying crescendo, rushing from $2,400 an ounce to $2,440 before recoiling to $2,360. @GC.1 1Y mountain Gold, 1-year This twitchy cross-asset action at some point could reflect a helpful upwelling of trader anxiety and a rebuilding of a wall of worry, though the middle of the squall is no occasion for such a confident forecast. In such a period of flux, when it's a struggle to bridge the story from setup to satisfying conclusion, it helps to return to the outline by stacking up what we know, or are pretty sure of, about the current backdrop. Bull market's backdrop First, it's a bull market, and not a particularly mature or excessively generous one yet. Whether one dates it to the ultimate October 2022 S & P 500 low or, as some prefer, to last October when market breadth bottomed, the trend is higher, the overshoots tend to happen to the upside, the pullbacks are ultimately contained and buyable. The rare persistence and breadth of the rally (up 10% two straight quarters, no 2% dip in five months) from October 2023 through March strongly suggests an ultimate peak has not been reached, based on any number of studies of past markets that behaved similarly. Even so, as I wrote here two weeks ago when I recited some of those stats, ""In those prior 11 times the S & P entered the second quarter up at least 10%, the smallest pullback the rest of the year was 4%, and those were in the 1960s."" The smallest setback in recent decades during such years was more than 6%. We're now in a 2.7% pullback. It's safe to surmise that at some point the market was going to seize on some set of credible excuses to undergo a decent little shakeout at minimum. Not to suggest the stickiness in CPI inflation is a mere empty excuse, but some perspective on the inflation picture is worth a mention. There should still be lagging disinflation in shelter running through coming reports. And more crucially, the Fed's 2% inflation target is based on the PCE measure, whose consumption-based weightings have taken it lower than CPI. Economists see the core PCE annualized gain coming in around 2.8% (the report is due in two weeks). The Fed members' latest median forecast for core PCE at year-end was 2.6%, and their median expected number of rate cuts this year was three. This is not a vast distance to travel to set the stage for one of those ""optional"" rate cuts to occur. The rethink of the Fed path has done nothing to interrupt the corporate-earnings recovery now anticipated, and probably required in order to validate current full valuations. FactSet's John Butters figures first-quarter S & P 500 earnings growth will exceed 7% over the prior year, based strictly on the average margin of outperformance versus forecasts seen over the past four reporting periods. The market reactions will be noisy and will expose pockets of ""excess belief"" among investors in certain favorite themes. When Fastenal fell short of expectations last Thursday, shares of this play on big industrial-capex themes fell 6.5% and dragged down WW Grainger 3.5%. Yet both stocks are still outperforming the S & P this year. As Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert put it on Friday, ""Markets have priced in a higher probability of the Goldilocks scenario playing out this year, introducing more downside risk to 'good but not good enough' news… A buying opportunity may present as we progress through the reporting period if we see consistent positive surprises followed up with a rightsizing of market implied growth expectations."" Tactically, with short-term momentum broken, a reset of attitudes is underway. The S & P 500 closed Friday at exactly the same level of five weeks earlier, on March 8 – which was perhaps the moment of maximum investor confidence in the ""we can have it all"" thesis. The day before, Powell had said the Fed was ""not far"" from being able to trim rates, then on the 8 th a near-perfect employment report cemented the soft-landing consensus. The market, in its way, is doubling back to test these premises.",4/13/2024,-2,0.563762605,0.00487063,0.000720311,0.419263214,0.010381129,0.001002162

Conversely, some stocks look like they are due for some more cooling off. After a slow start, (trading volume on Monday was the weakest since Christmas), the major averages ultimately registered a weekly decline as inflationary fears, rising Treasury yields and subdued bank earnings weighed on investors. The S & P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6% and 2.4% respectively, notching their second week of declines. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.5% in its third straight weekly loss. CNBC Pro used its stock screener tool to find the most overbought and oversold stocks on Wall Street as measured by their 14-day relative strength index, or RSI. Stocks with a 14-day RSI above 70 are considered overbought, which indicates that shares might soon turn lower. Conversely, a reading below 30 often signals that a stock is oversold, with a potential rebound possible. Devon Energy made the list of overbought stocks, dominated by oil and gas producers, with an RSI of 82. Year to date, the energy stock has climbed 18%. Earlier this month, shares of Devon popped on the back of a Wells Fargo upgrade to overweight from equal weight. Analyst Roger Read believes Devon can turn things around this year, after struggling with well productivity in 2023. ""We expect high-grading efforts in the Delaware Basin will begin to bear fruit in Q2′24, leading to a significant improvement in capital efficiency and a positive re-rating of the stock,"" the Wells analyst wrote. With a similar RSI of 82 and after touching an all-time high this past week, the country's largest oil and gas producer Exxon Mobil also looks overbought. Shares have soared more than 20% this year, almost three times the gain in the S & P 500. Barclays recently initiated research coverage of Exxon with an overweight rating . The bank said the energy ""sector offers a better value proposition than ever before."" Farm equipment maker Deere scored an RSI of 79. Truist Securities initiated coverage of the Illinois-based company in March with a buy rating and a price target of $494. ""In our view, Deere is among the best-run industrial machinery companies with a growing technology story and earnings stream,"" the Truist analyst wrote. Shares of Deere are little changed so far in 2024, down less than 1%. On the other hand, Texas-based life insurer Globe Life , with an RSI of just 3, is among the most oversold stocks on Wall Street. Shares have been cut in half, collapsing almost 52% so far this year. The stock plummeted on Thursday after short seller Fuzzy Panda Research said in a report it had taken a short position in Globe Life, making multiple allegations of insurance fraud. Late Thursday, management rebutted the accusations and Truist Securities repeated a $125 price target on Friday, when shares of Globe Life bounced back 20%. Similarly, investors are overwhelmingly bearish around Lamb Weston . Shares of the Idaho-based french-fry maker have tumbled 26% this year, plummeting almost 20% one day in early April after it missed fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue. Lamb Weston posted adjusted third-quarter earnings of $1.20 per share on revenue of $1.46 billion, less than earnings of $1.45 on revenue of $1.65 billion that analysts polled by FactSet had expected. — CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this report.",4/13/2024,-2,0.405011714,0.172678903,0.0030064,0.322175175,0.093758218,0.003369588
228,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/12/these-stocks-may-move-higher-higher-after-reporting-earnings-next-week.html,FDS,FactSet,These stocks could get a bump after reporting earnings next week,"With sticky inflation and increasing uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's rate-cutting path, first-quarter earnings could be the next best sign of the stock market's health, and whether equities can make further progress or manage to hold on to recent gains. After a stellar first quarter, stocks have had a rough start to the second quarter, with all three major U.S. stock indexes trading in the red this month. Hotter-than-expected inflation data released Wednesday and Friday further dampened investor sentiment by pushing out expectations of when and how many times the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates this year. Several big financial and medical technology companies in the S & P 500 are scheduled to start releasing their latest results next week. With companies just beginning to report their profit pictures, investors may want to take a look at those businesses that have a reliably strong track record of beating analyst estimates and seeing their shares rally in response. Using Bespoke Investment Group data, CNBC Pro screened for stocks set to release their quarterly results that meet the following criteria: Reporting earnings next week Average earnings per share beat rate of 70% or higher Shares typically gain an average of 1% or more after reporting earnings The screen turned up medical device company Intuitive Surgical as showing the highest average one-day move after reporting earnings, at 2.43%, and an average EPS beat rate of 87%. Shares have jumped nearly 15.5% year to date, fueled by the company's fourth-quarter earnings beat on Jan. 23 that reflected higher demand for its surgical robots used in minimally invasive procedures. Citigroup recently raised its price target on Intuitive to $462 from $428 and kept a buy rating on the stock, saying in an early April note that the Food and Drug Administration's long-awaited approval of the company's Da Vinci 5 robotic surgery system should drive the stock higher. ""Intuitive continues to maintain its robotic surgery leadership position and the approval of Da Vinci 5 solidifies that this will not change anytime soon,"" Citi analyst Joanne Wuensch wrote. ""We anticipate Da Vinci Xi demand will hold strong in the interim as customers await the commercial launch of da Vinci 5, benefiting from improving utilization and procedure volume trends in the near-term."" Intuitive is slated to report earnings next Thursday. Home construction company D.R. Horton , which also reports on Thursday, has a 76% earnings beat rate and the stock typically gains roughly 1.5% after results. Wedbush downgraded D.R. Horton to underperform from neutral last week, saying homebuilders will see weaker demand heading into the summer. D.R. Horton has slumped more than 9% this quarter as homebuilders and buyers alike struggle with higher mortgage rates and input costs. Toolmaker Snap-on had the highest earnings beat rate on the screen, at 90%. Analysts polled by FactSet have a consensus hold rating on the stock and an average price target of almost $280, implying about 5% downside.

The bull market is on edge. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S & P 500 registered their second straight losing week after a hotter-than-anticipated March consumer price index report weighed on the interest rate outlook for investors. Markets are now pricing in two rate cuts starting in September, CME FedWatch Tool shows, instead of the three rate cuts starting in June investors held in their base case prior to the CPI report. Troubling signals are abounding as well. Treasury yields are surging, with the benchmark 10-year yield back above 4.5%. Oil prices are on the rise, with Exxon Mobil hitting an all-time high amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. Safe haven gold is spiking, with consumers heading to their local Costco stores to snap up gold bars . The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) , commonly referred to as the fear gauge, has crept back up to levels last seen in October 2023. Parts of tech are outperforming, though, with Apple notably closing out the week with a 4% advance. .VIX YTD mountain VIX Next week will bring more information that could add to the recent choppiness. The first-quarter earnings season, which kicked off Friday, will give Wall Street insight into how businesses expect to weather an environment of elevated interest rates. Elsewhere, more macro data, such as U.S. retail sales, will give insight into how the consumer is handling the pressure of higher prices. ""I'm a little concerned with all the cross currents,"" Bob Doll, chief executive of Crossmark Global Investments, told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Friday. ""When the [price-to-earnings ratios] are over 20, things better be nearly perfect. And when you're not getting the rate cuts, you can't sustain the PE, and then if earnings become a question mark, that will cause a lot more people to ask questions,"" Doll added. To be sure, many investors expect that markets can absorb the likelihood of fewer rate cuts this year so long as the Federal Reserve does not take a suddenly hawkish view and decide to put rate hikes back on the table. As it is, markets have managed to rally this year, even as the expectations for rate cuts have eased. First-quarter earnings season underway The corporate earnings season kicks into high gear in the week ahead. Investors are expecting this first-quarter earnings season will show which businesses are able to continue withstanding higher pricing pressures, as well as the upcoming refinancing cycle. ""Earnings, this quarter, next, will be so telling,"" said Wolfe Research's Rob Ginsberg. ""If they show no signs of deterioration, we probably just consolidate and power on, but if they start to exhibit some weakness, that's when you worry about stagflation."" ""That's not a great backdrop for stocks,"" he added. Ginsberg, who anticipates a 4% to 6% consolidation in equities, said the pullback could be worse if fundamentals show signs of weakening. Investors broadly anticipate larger companies with robust balance sheets will weather the pricing pressure, but many worry that small-cap companies that may have more debt on their balance sheets could get hurt by elevated interest rates. This week, the small-cap Russell 2000 is on track for a losing week, down by more than 1%. Next week's results from major banks Bank of America , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will likely take on greater significance for investors given JPMorgan's disappointing net interest income guidance this week. Results from a succession of regional banks, which may have higher credit reserves and greater exposure to real estate, will also attract scrutiny. Dow component UnitedHealth will also be reporting results next week. Overall, analysts expect S & P 500 companies to have grown earnings by more than 3% from the year-earlier period, FactSet data shows. If that's the case, it will mark the third straight quarter of earnings growth for the benchmark. Consumer in focus Next week will also bring a raft of economic data that could give insight into how the consumer is holding up — following the hotter-than-expected CPI for March as well as signs of weakening consumer sentiment. The March U.S. retail sales data set to release Monday is expected to show a deceleration from the prior month. Economists polled by FactSet anticipate a rise of 0.4% last month, down from a 0.6% increase in the previous reading. ""[Consumer health] is a big thing for us. It's something we think looks OK, but if we see a change in employment trends, or if we see that the consumer does fall behind because their weighted average cost of debt really starts to impair their spending, that could have kind of broader consequences, we think, for the market,"" said Robert Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank. ""And so, we remain hyper-focused there."" Elsewhere, Haworth said he will be reviewing the first-quarter growth data out of China to gain insight into the state of global manufacturing. An improvement there, he anticipates, will add credence to higher-for-longer interest rates from the Fed. ""So, the market will be paying attention to that,"" he said.

The online ticketing service is aiming for a valuation of at least $16.5 billion, which is what it was valued at in late 2021 during its latest round of private funding.

The company has been working with JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs over the past two years on the IPO. The Information was the first to report the news.

StubHub has been a longtime player in the ticketing industry since its launch in 2000. It was purchased by eBay for $310 million in 2007, but reacquired by its co-founder Eric Baker in 2020 for $4 billion through his new company Viagogo.

Online ticketing rival SeatGeek has also reportedly been evaluating a potential IPO this year. If StubHub does enter the public market, it will trade alongside competitors Vivid Seats and Live Nation . Vivid Seats has a market cap of $1.2 billion and Live Nation is valued at just under $24 billion, according to FactSet.

The live events marketplace has bloomed in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, as people have gravitated toward out-of-home entertainment and experiences. Record-breaking concert ticket sales, such as those seen for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour and Beyoncé's Renaissance Tour, have fueled revenues for ticketing companies across the board.

The S & P 500 rose 3.1% in March alone, putting it 10.2% higher for the year. That performance also brought signs that the narrow market rally may be broadening out. The energy sector is ahead almost 13% so far this year, while financials have climbed almost 12%, with both groups beating the broad market's gains. With this in mind, CNBC Pro screened for stocks in the S & P 500 that might be positioned for a rebound this year. The companies in the screen all met the following criteria: Lagging the market, but not collapsing: They are flat to down 10% year to date. Well-liked by analysts: Consensus rating is a buy. Upside potential: Average price target is 20% or higher than the stock's current level. Take a look at where analysts see some of these stocks headed next: Online dating platforms service Match Group is one of the underperforming stocks that could make a comeback this year. Shares were down 2.3% in 2024 through the open Wednesday, March 27, but the average price target implies around 22% upside potential, according to FactSet. Match was also highlighted as one of Goldman Sachs' favorite asset-light stocks earlier this month. UnitedHealth Group is another market laggard with promise. According to the consensus analyst price target, the stock could rise 20.1%, per FactSet. Currently, the stock is down about 6.5% in 2024, as of the middle of last week. By comparison, the broader health-care sector is up 8.3% during the same period. The health-care company is dealing with the fallout of a cybersecurity breach from February. As a result, it has paid out more than $3.3 billion to providers affected by the hack. UNH XLV YTD mountain UnitedHealth Group versus the Health Care Select SPDR Fund Casino and hotel company Caesars Entertainment also made the list. The stock was down about 8.9% for the year through the middle of last week, but the average price target on the stock suggests shares could bounce back nearly 37%. Cruise line operator Carnival was down 8.1%, but could climb up back into the green this year. Analysts forecast shares gaining 24.3% from their current levels. Carnival posted mixed results for the first quarter last Wednesday. Although its reported revenue of $5.41 billion fell short of the $5.43 billion forecast by analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv, its adjusted loss per share of 14 cents was better than the 18 cent loss estimated by the Street.

Due to high interest rates, investors have had a plethora of options to earn some income. Bond yields popped in 2023 amid the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes. The 10-year Treasury is yielding above 4%, and shorter-term bills of one year and less have rates over 5%. Still, dividend stocks tend to do well during periods of economic recovery, which is now underway, Bank of America said recently . That means investors could not only get yield, but may also see the stocks' prices move higher. ""We believe that we are now in a total return world in which the contribution of dividends to total market returns could be significantly higher than it was in the last decade, a period marked by falling cash yields and lofty price returns,"" Bank of America equity and quant strategist Savita Subramanian wrote in a March 14 note. Investors should also look for names that have a history of growing their dividends . CNBC Pro looked for stocks in the S & P 1500 that have raised their payout within the past year. They have also grown their dividends in at least four of the past five years. To find those that are undervalued, CNBC screened for names that are underperforming the S & P 500, with a forward price to earnings ratio of less than 21.

In January, the natural gas and oil exploration company announced it struck a $7.4 billion all-stock agreement to buy natural gas producer Southwestern Energy. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter. The proposed merger is the latest attempt by Chesapeake Energy to build back up after emerging from bankruptcy restructuring in 2021.

234,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/17/talk-of-recession-is-dying-down-in-corporate-america.html,FDS,FactSet,Talk of recession is dying down in corporate America,"Discussion around the potential for a recession is becoming less common among American business executives. Ever since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in early 2022, corporations and investors have braced for how a recession might play out. Now, the topic is losing its luster on earnings calls held by the largest U.S. companies as it becomes increasingly likely that inflation has been cooled without causing an economic contraction. The word recession came up on the fourth-quarter earnings calls of 47 companies in the S & P 500, according to market data platform FactSet. That's the lowest number since the end of 2021. Another way of looking at it: Compared with the same three-month period a year ago, the word was mentioned on less than one-third of the number of calls. And despite coming off a period plagued with economic concerns, the fourth-quarter stat came in below the five- and 10-year averages of 85 and 61, respectively. Sweeter chatter When recession chatter did come up, the tune was often sweeter. Executives pointed to a better macroeconomic environment than what they saw in prior quarters. Everyone ""seems to be more optimistic this time this year compared to this time last year,"" said John Wall, the finance chief of technology company Cadence Design Systems . ""At this time last year, everyone was asking me, 'When was the recession going to happen?'"" The gross domestic product grew at a rate of 3.2% in the final quarter of 2023. While down from the prior three-month period, the measure of all goods and services clearly showed the economy dodging a recession once considered all but unavoidable. Cadence's Wall isn't alone in his confidence. Almost half of the more than two dozen finance chiefs surveyed by CNBC said they expect the Federal Reserve to control inflation without a recession, a scenario known as a soft landing. Another nearly 15% of respondents to CNBC's CFO Council survey said they believed a recession had already taken place. Improved sentiment came as almost three out of every four companies surpassed Wall Street expectations in the latest quarter, according to FactSet. One was commercial real estate developer CBRE , which topped analysts' consensus estimates for revenue and income in its fourth quarter. CFO Emma Giamartino said the Dallas-based company's full-year 2024 guidance is ""contingent"" on the Fed cutting short-term interest rates and the economy skirting a recession. For the full year, CBRE forecasts between $4.25 and $4.65 in core earnings per share. But Giamartino said much more of that than usual will come in the second half of the year, coinciding with when the central bank is now expected to start easing back on interest rates. Eye on the consumer In recent years, consumer-facing businesses have monitored customer behavior for signs of weakness as inflation has pinched pocketbooks. At Costco , the wholesale club said its Kirkland Signature store brand had seen increased popularity when shoppers prioritized value amid rising prices. But CFO Richard Galanti said the trade-down trend was short-lived. ""People were, in my view, switching a little bit out,"" Galanti told analysts earlier this month. ""But that's changed. We don't see that as much anymore."" Extra Space Storage said demand has held up as customers juggle living situations, especially with 30-year mortgage rates sitting near 7% . Almost half of storage users said they are getting units as they move between apartments, according to CEO Joseph Margolis. ""The housing market certainly will help, but it's not the sole driver of demand for self-storage,"" Margolis said on the Salt Lake City-based firm's call with analysts late last month. ""More transition is just good."" Extra Space is cautious about anticipating lower interest rates too soon. In drafting guidance for future financial performance, the company doesn't expect levels to come down in time to boost the summer housing market. Still, Margolis acknowledged that avoiding economic contraction is good for business. Extra Space was one of 37 S & P 500 companies using the term soft landing during fourth-quarter earnings calls, the highest number in at least three years, according to FactSet data. ""A strong economy is always better than a weak economy,"" Margolis said. ""All indications are now that we're going to have more of a soft landing than a recession."" Improving dealscape After higher interest rates led to a slump in mergers and acquisitions, executives wonder if 2024 can mark a rebound for deal volume if the cost of borrowing drops. Host Hotels said the transaction market can benefit as improved macroeconomic sentiment leads to more visibility on operating performance. The upscale hotel investor said that with $2.9 billion in total liquidity, it's well-positioned to make acquisitions. That's an outlook shared across sectors ranging from real estate to technology. Asphalt and concrete maker Vulcan Materials , for example, called 2024 a year of ""catch-up"" in the space. ""While it was pretty quiet in 2023 with a lot of unknowns out there, I think it will be very busy in 2024,"" CEO J. Thomas Hill said of the merger and acquisition environment. ""I would expect us to bring some deals to the finish line."" 'Difficult to predict' To be sure, some executives are less sure they're in for a stronger year, even if a recession has been avoided. It's ""still very difficult to predict"" when demand for home improvement products will pick up, Lowe's CEO Marvin Ellison said. Though growing expectations of a soft landing are grounds for optimism, he said it's unclear how long it would take for consumers to shift spending habits even after interest rates start to retreat. Depressed home sales remain a cause for concern, Ellison said. Mortgage levels are still too high to encourage those locked in at lower rates to move, he said, which is typically a natural catalyst for home improvement spending. The North Carolina-based retailer has also been hurt as Americans opt to spend on experiences like travel , football games or concerts rather than goods after the pandemic, according to the chief executive. ""The consumer is financially healthy, but in this post-pandemic timeframe, customers are still showing a preference for spending on services,"" Ellison told analysts late last month. ""While we anticipate these trends will normalize, the timing is uncertain.""",3/17/2024,0,0.17468904,0.384045005,0.004435226,0.314288586,0.119565688,0.002976483

These alternatives are expected to see huge earnings growth going forward,"There's a host of stocks that can still benefit from the artificial intelligence craze besides Nvidia , according to analysts. Nvidia's annual GTC Conference , dubbed ""AI Woodstock"" by Bank of America, on Monday will feature a keynote speech from CEO Jensen Huang and allow for the high-flying chipmaker to spotlight its latest products and announce what's ahead. Shares of Nvidia have skyrocketed nearly 80% so far this year, but the company has had a volatile week as some traders took in profits ahead of the conference. As investors look for AI plays beyond Nvidia, CNBC Pro used FactSet data to screen for stocks in the technology and semiconductor space that should see significant earnings growth in the future. Here's the criteria we used for the selection below: S & P 1500 tech sector Market capitalization of $1 billion or more Expected 2024 earnings per share growth of more than 35% Expected 2025 EPS growth of 10% or more Advanced Micro Devices , also a global semiconductor name like Nvidia, remains an AI darling among investors. The stock, which has jumped roughly 30% year to date, added 2.1% on Friday. Analysts anticipate year-over-year earnings per share for 2024 will grow by 39.5% and advance by 48.7% in 2025. Citi recently named AMD among its ""most favored names"" in semiconductors, which it thinks should continue trading at a premium despite worries about high valuations for the stocks. Citi analyst Christopher Danely wrote in a note that ""clients are excited about the AI opportunity for Nvidia and AMD, equipment names on positive capex revisions and various CHIPS act subsidies, and NXP on their resilient auto exposure."" Seagate Technology , a data storage company, also made the cut. Shares are up 43% over the past year, but have added less than 1% in 2024. Analysts forecast EPS growth of 262% for 2024 compared to the previous year. Evercore ISI initiated coverage of Seagate on Feb. 27 with an outperform rating and $110 price target, saying the stock is well positioned to benefit from the cyclical recovery with hyperscalers and that the company could see margin expansion as Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording, or HAMR, technology scales up. Fabless chipmaker SiTime also came up on the screen. It's been a rocky 2024 for the stock, which is off 31% year to date. However, analysts have high expectations for EPS growth, forecasting a year-over-year jump of 224.4% in 2024. Last month, SiTime reported a beat on fourth-quarter revenue and earnings expectations, per FactSet. Management said on the company's earnings call that sequential growth is expected throughout 2024, with the second half of the year being stronger than the first. SiTime's data center business drove significant growth in its communications and enterprise segment, the company added. Other stocks that can expect to see huge earnings growth moving forward include Super Micro Computer , audio and imaging technologies developer Dolby Laboratories and Ultra Clean Holdings .",3/16/2024,0,0.207800835,0.66144526,0.003308224,0.101881936,0.021933923,0.003629896

The final trading day of the month and the first quarter — the glorious rally that you missed if you only cared about the Federal Reserve. While the futures are flat this morning, the S & P 500 is pacing for its best first-quarter performance since 2019. Fed Governor Christopher Waller on Wednesday said recent disappointing inflation data means the central bank is ""in no rush"" to cut interest rates. We are going higher for longer which means you want to own Wells Fargo . 2. HSBC chose to raise its price targets on several financials: Club stock Morgan Stanley to $100 from $96 to $100 (Club name); Goldman Sachs to $460 from $432; Citigroup to $70 from $61; JPMorga n to $205 from $188; Club name Wells Fargo to $60 from $55. Meanwhile, it upgraded PNC Financial to hold from sell and downgraded Bank of America to hold from buy. 3. Walgreens on Thursday reported a huge quarterly revenue beat: $37.05 billion vs. $35.86 billion expected. However, the retail pharmacy's U.S. healthcare segment posted an operating loss of $13.1 billion due to a steep impairment charge related to its primary care provider VillageMD. Real earnings per share: $1.20. The company also lowered the high end of its full-year adjusted earnings guidance due to the challenging retail environment. Shares of WBA dipped 1.6% in the premarket. 4. RH 's fourth-quarter sales and EPS missed Wall Street expectations, but the luxury home goods retailer forecast stronger better-than-expected revenue growth for 2024 due to increasing demand. At last, a jubilant Gary Friedman, RH's chairman and CEO. It's still the worst housing market in 30 years ... JPMorgan raised its price target on RH shares to $345 from $329, while Baird went to $300 from $280, and BofA lifted to $375 from $360. 5. Estee Lauder is a Club holding that has been awful. BofA said earnings have bottomed. The cosmetics company moved into Amazon's Premium Beauty store and is working through its excess inventory at last. That reduces reliance on China and travel retail. This is why we held it through a halving of the estimates. BofA upgraded shares to buy from hold and raised its PT to $170 from $160. Shares rose more than 3% in premarket trading. 6. ICYMI: I shared my outlook for stocks heading into the second quarter at our March Club meeting on Wednesday, including the 3 things I need to see before buying a stock in this bull market. We also shared our latest thinking on each of our 33 portfolio stocks. 7. MoffettNathanson said to stay with DraftKings as there is free cash flow coming despite a potential NCAA player prop ban and regulators exploring raising New Jersey online gaming tax rates. The firm raised its PT to $55 from $52 and kept its buy rating. 8. Vornado Realty Trust , an office-focused real estate investment trust, upgraded to a hold-equivalent rating from sell at Morgan Stanley. They like SL Green , too. Near the end of the CRE crash? 9. A round of price-target cuts for United Parcel Service , including from analysts at Stifel, HSBC and TD Cowen. I think this is fallout from losing customers to FedEx , the ones who used to be UPS but moved their business due to uncertainty around last year's UPS-Teamsters labor talks. 10. Analysts giving love to Kimberly-Clark after its investor day. Price target bumps at Piper Sandler ($152 from $145) and HSBC ($146 from $134), while Evercore ISI upgraded the Kleenex maker to a buy-equivalent rating from in line. I really like Kimberly-Clark's restructuring; gives local management more say and cuts costs.

Analyst Brian Lee maintained his buy rating on Sunnova and kept his $14 price target, which suggests the beaten-down stock can jump a whopping 194%. ""We believe the path for the stock remains highly sensitive to cash flows in the near-to-medium term and investor confidence around the company's ability to pay down and/or refinance debt,"" analyst Brian Lee wrote in a Wednesday note. ""We note that NOVA remains one of the most shorted names in our solar coverage. That said, we see an opportunity for the stock to rally significantly on any actions the company can take in the near-term to restore investor confidence."" Sunnova's share price has fallen more than 68% this year and more than 50% since the company reported earnings in late February. The results reflected a deeper net loss of $234 million in the fourth quarter and led to heightened concerns about the company's balance sheet and need for more liquidity. The stock also plunged in late February after Sunnova announced a $100 million at-the-market stock offering program , which its management described as ""good housekeeping"" rather than an immediate need to raise capital. In the near term, Lee pointed to three factors vital to the company restoring investor confidence and for its stock to also recover: Potential asset sales Minimal to no cash burn Repurchase of debt According to Lee, Sunnova has a sizeable portfolio of non-solar loans—such as generators, EV chargers and home security systems—that could be an ""underappreciated source"" of value and cash. When it comes to keeping its cash — and potentially growing it in the near term — the analyst believes the flow through of higher pricing, more disciplined cost control and slight working capital adjustments could allow the company to maintain cash at relatively stable levels into the first quarter. Given the company's debt, Lee thinks Sunnova would benefit most from generating cash from potential asset sales and then working towards reaching cash flow generation of $200 million to $500 million in 2025. After that, the company can refinance its remaining balance.",3/21/2024,0,0.032495927,0.024984419,0.001760213,0.129945591,0.80944103,0.001372848

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Sunday that the ability to have difficult conversations has put the two economic superpowers on ""a more stable footing"" over the past year. As they began a meeting in Beijing, Li responded that the two countries needed to respect each other and should be partners, not adversaries, adding that ""constructive progress"" had been made during Yellen's trip. Yellen said Washington and Beijing had a ""duty"" to responsibly manage the complex relationship, as she brought her case for reining in China's excess factory capacity to the Chinese leadership. ""While we have more to do, I believe that, over the past year, we have put our bilateral relationship on more stable footing,"" Yellen said. ""This has not meant ignoring our differences or avoiding tough conversations. It has meant understanding that we can only make progress if we directly and openly communicate with one another.""

As the world's two largest economies, we have a duty to our own countries and to the world to responsibly manage our complex relationship... Janet Yellen U.S. Treasury Secretary

Yellen has made the threat of China's excess production of electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels and other clean energy products to producers in the U.S. and other countries a focus of her second visit to China in nine months. She visited Beijing in July 2023 to try to normalize bilateral economic relations after a period of heightened tension caused by differences over issues ranging from Taiwan to COVID-19's origins and trade disputes. In a further sign of the ties stabilising, U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping sought to manage tensions over the South China Sea in a nearly two-hour call on Tuesday, their first direct talks since a summit in November. U.S. and Chinese military officials met their Chinese counterparts last week for a series of rare meetings in Hawaii focussed on operational safely and professionalism.

Balanced growth

On Saturday in the southern export hub of Guangzhou, Yellen and her main economic counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng, agreed to launch a dialogue focused on ""balanced growth."" Yellen said she intends to use the forum to advocate for a level playing field with China to protect U.S. workers and businesses. ""As the world's two largest economies, we have a duty to our own countries and to the world to responsibly manage our complex relationship and to cooperate and show leadership on addressing pressing global challenges,"" Yellen told Li. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts China's battery manufacturing capacity will outpace demand by a factor of four by 2027, as its EV industry continues to grow. Beijing's support for battery-powered rides has helped homegrown champions like BYD 002594.SZ and Geely 0175.HK grab share in the world's biggest car market, and turn China into the world's largest auto exporter. But rapid growth has also meant China has created excess manufacturing capacity that could be between 5 and 10 million EVs per year, according to consultancy Automobility.",4/7/2024,2,0.005047684,0.975317359,0.001238787,0.013733926,0.004140999,0.000521217

FAQs Is it worth having disability insurance? If your family depends on your ability to earn a living, having disability insurance can ensure that you'll be able to continue working towards your goals and maintain your lifestyle if you're disabled during your working years. How much is disability insurance? Long-term disability insurance typically costs between 1% and 3% of your income. So, a person earning $100,000 per year, for example, would spend about $83 to $250 per month for disability coverage. The benefit amount, period, and elimination period can influence the cost of your coverage, as can your age, health status and specific occupation. How much disability insurance do I need? The amount of disability insurance you need depends on your monthly income, and how much other coverage you may have through work. You may also want to consider the amount of savings you have. For a general idea of what you'll need, start by adding up your monthly bills. Then, add up how much income you'd continue to receive if you were disabled, such as benefits from workplace disability coverage or investment income. Subtract your monthly bills from the money you'd continue to receive, and that figure is the amount you'd need to receive each month in disability insurance benefits.

Bottom line

Disability insurance can keep you afloat financially if you're unable to work due to an illness or injury. It generally costs between 1% and 3% of your annual income, but can be well worth it.

With CDs, you deposit a specific amount of money for a fixed period of time — months or years — at a guaranteed rate of interest. While you can't prematurely withdraw those funds without paying a penalty, the trade-off is that CDs tend to offer higher interest rates than most savings accounts.

However, many young people don't use them. Less than 11% of Gen Zers and millennials use CDs, according to a 2023 survey by GOBankingRates.

The yield for 12-month CDs — which are loosely correlated to the Fed's benchmark interest rate — soared from a weighted average of nearly 0% in December 2021 to 5.16% as of December 2023, according to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation data.

Currently, you can find 12-month CDs that pay close to 5.5% in interest with no money down. That's much higher than the average annual percentage yield you'll find for traditional savings accounts, which was 0.57% as of Jan. 16, 2024, per Bankrate. While high-yield savings might offer APRs more comparable to CDs, you can often find CDs with slightly higher rates.

Some CDs also offer higher yields than one-year Treasury bonds, which are comparably safe investments.

Many banks and credit unions offer CDs for a variety of terms, typically ranging from three months to five years, so it's easy to shop around for a good rate and term that suits your needs.

""Assuming the Fed plans on lowering rates this year, it's time to lock in,"" says Jay Zigmont, certified financial planner and founder of Childfree Wealth.",1/16/2024,0,0.082030177,0.590566397,0.003687203,0.240466222,0.080312401,0.002937613

All times ET. 8:38 a.m.: Bank of America says buy this cybersecurity stock ahead of a recovery cycle Bank of America is sticking by Fortinet for the long run even as Wall Street braces for another weak quarter for billings and guidance. ""We believe the underlying demand for hardware-based Firewalls remains solid, and Fortinet's value proposition of lower pricing and greater feature set/throughput should continue to fuel the growth in the long term,"" wrote analyst Tal Liani. ""By 2H24 we expect supplies of Fortinet's new ASIC chip, FortiSP5, to improve, potentially driving some replacement with the existing installed base."" When the cybersecurity company reports fourth-quarter results next month, the firm anticipates a year-over-year decline in billings, along with slower revenue growth versus 2023. Liani also views Wall Street estimates as too high and in need of a reset, expecting first-quarter billings to face ""greater seasonality headwinds and continued tough comps."" Despite this near-term overhang, Bank of America regards Fortinet as a ""strong competitor"" in the network security space, and a stock to buy before its recovery cycle.

While bar gets tougher as Uber laps the introduction of high-margin ads, we see strong driver supply, a stable competitive environment, and new advertising services (and partners) as contributing to margin expansion in 2024,"" the note said. The new price target is 9% above where Uber's stock closed on Monday. Bank of America has a buy rating on the stock. For the fourth quarter, Bank of America said it expects Uber to beat expectations for revenue and a key profit metric when the company reports its results on Feb. 7. — Jesse Pound 8:32 a.m.: Seaport downgrades Netflix after the stock's recent rally There's a lot of enthusiasm around Netflix , but the recent rally has left the stock fully valued, according to Seaport Research Partners. The firm downgraded the streaming giant to neutral from buy on Tuesday. Shares have jumped more than 18% since Netflix reported stronger subscriber growth than expected for the fourth quarter last Tuesday and announced it will air the WWE flagship program Raw starting next year. The stock closed at $575.79 on Monday, just below Seaport's price target of $576. Seaport said Netflix's addition of live sports rights will support the streamer's strategy of building a global, in-demand platform with an advertising model layered on top. However, that will come at a cost, with the WWE rights costing about $5 billion, analyst David Joyce wrote in a note. ""Netflix has its qualities and attributes - including ease of use, recommendation engine, programming sourcing, talent relationships, global footprint from which to build incremental businesses in advertising and gaming, positive FCF, and capital returns,"" analyst David Joyce wrote in a note. ""That said, various valuation metrics relative to growth expectations through 2027 appear to be rather full,"" he added. — Michelle Fox 8:14 a.m.: BTIG hikes price target on TripAdvisor, sees 35% upside BTIG is bullish on TripAdvisor heading into the travel company's earnings report next month. The firm said it sees healthy underlying trends and raised its price target on Tuesday to $30 from $22.14, implying 35% upside from Monday's close. It specifically sees strength in its experiences booking platform, Viator. ""Traffic trends suggest Viator bookings growth in the 20% range and that could push revenue growth to the mid-20s after layering in a take-rate tailwind,"" analyst Jake Fuller wrote in a note to clients. He upgrade TripAdvisor to buy in December. ""Further out, our perspective on 2024 is firming with increased confidence in above-Street estimates given the topline trajectory of Viator, $35M in identified Core segment cost savings and Viator/TheFork shifting from EBITDA losses to profits,"" he added. TripAdvisor is expected to release fourth-quarter earnings Feb. 13.

The new target suggests shares could decrease about 5.5% from Pinterest's latest closing price. ""We remain constructive over the longer term, however, near-term, we believe rising 1Q/2024 expectations are fairly captured at current valuation levels,"" Kulkarni wrote in a Tuesday note. ""We await a better growth-adjusted entry point along with sustained user growth to become more constructive."" The photo-sharing website saw record-high 90% incremental EBITDA margins last year, Kulkarni noted, saying consensus expectations are calling for roughly 40% and 50% incremental margin growth in 2024 and 20205, respectively. Given that Amazon's ad-spending business is expected to grow in 2024, Kulkarni added that Pinterest's partnership with Amazon could also lead to between $137 million and $150 million in incremental revenues for Pinterest this year. In the fourth quarter, roughly 0.05% of Amazon's ad spending was allocated to Pinterest, he said. Pinterest shares gained 1% in premarket trading. The stock is up about 5.8% so far this year. — Pia Singh 7:37 a.m.: Oppenheimer initiates bowling name with outperform rating Oppenheimer says it's ""aiming to bowl a strike"" with Pinstripes Holdings . The firm initiated coverage on the bowling company with an outperform rating and $6 price target on shares. The price target suggests shares could rally around 50% from Monday's close. ""PNST represents an intriguing and more speculative investment opportunity within the attractive 'eatertainment' category. The company is armed with robust unit economics and proven portability as it enters a growth inflection aimed at scaling its profitable EBITDA model,"" analyst Brian Bittner wrote in a Monday note. Shares have declined around 65% since the stock began trading on Jan. 2. Bittner cited investor concerts regarding capital structure overhangs, which he believes could ease if management manages to successfully execute its new unit opening strategy and achieve its financial targets. ""Underlying fundamentals are compelling with appetizing venue-level economics, above-average new unit paybacks, and a long-term opportunity to exponentially expand its current 15-unit footprint,"" said Bittner. — Hakyung Kim 7:08 a.m.: BTIG upgrades Block to buy, bullish on Cash App and Square growth Analyst Andrew Harte upgraded Block to buy from neutral, saying margins are poised to expand. His $85 price target implies shares could gain more than 23%. ""We see the company's growth opportunities paired with management's focus on bottom-line as presenting an attractive investment opportunity,"" Harte wrote in a Tuesday note. ""Our core investment thesis is focused on SQ's attractive position between the consumer and merchant with its Cash App and Square ecosystems and potential for each segment to become stronger as integrations are built between them."" Harte said Cash App and Square are strong as individual units and are expected to grow throughout fiscal 2024 and beyond. Square's increased focus on costs are attractive, he added, saying he expects the company to reach its goal of mid-20s adjusted operating margin by 2026, which should pose an opportunity for investors who are increasingly focused on GAAP profitability. Block's stock price traded nearly 3% higher in early morning trading. Shares are down 10.8% so far this year. — Pia Singh 6:33 a.m.: Western Alliance shares are 'fully valued', according to Wells Fargo Wells Fargo downgraded Western Alliance Bancorp to equal weight from overweight. ""Current results and guidance leave little room for error … risk/reward scenarios at this stock price level seem skewed to the downside,"" analyst Timur Braziler wrote in a Monday note. ""Valuation is now about in line with peers … and fully valued, in our view."" Shares are up about 6.6% this year, last closing at $70.11 per share. Braziler's new price target of $72, higher by $10, suggests about 2.7% potential upside over the next 12 months. Braziler noted that the bank's costs have increased, reflecting higher deposit earnings credit rate, higher tech and insurance spend. Liquidity and capital build are also taking away from profitability, he added. ""Near-term efficiency and profitability still lag pre-pandemic levels,"" Braziler said. ""In an upside scenario, WAL is able to return to industry leading growth, establish a solid capital base, and regain its prior levels of profitability. WAL has never had an issue being profitable, it has had an issue getting the proper multiple for that profitability."" — Pia Singh 6:07 a.m.: Oppenheimer downgrades Five Below on worries of slowing growth Five Below's valuation may not be aligned with its fundamentals, according to Oppenheimer. Analyst Brian Nagel downgraded Five Below to perform from outperform. He also lowered his price target on the discount retailer to $200, suggesting shares could gain just 7% over the next year. During premarket trading on Tuesday, shares fell 1.7%, adding to the stock's losses of more than 12% this year. ""Strategic positioning of the unique Five Below model and consumer proposition remain robust,"" Nagel wrote in a Tuesday note. ""That said, we are starting to fret that underlying growth dynamics for FIVE are slowing, at least somewhat, given a now larger base of units, waning remodeling opportunities, and stepped-up reinvestment requirements, on top of already elevated operating margins."" As the pace of growth for Five Below gradually diminishes, Nagel forecasted that the premium multiple shares at which shares trade could also moderate towards ""recent troughs."" He expects new store expansions to also gradually slow to the low-double digits. — Pia Singh 6:05 a.m.: Raymond James initiates CrowdStrike with outperform rating Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike is a bullish play for the long run, according to Raymond James. Analyst Adam Tindle initiated coverage on the stock with an outperform rating and $330 price target, which implies 9.8% potential upside for the stock. ""Our thesis is predicated on a near-term view that net new ARR (key growth metric) should accelerate alongside stabilization/improvement in the device end market as CY24 progresses,"" Tindle wrote in a Monday note. ""We model this metric slightly above Street estimates for the next few quarters, but would not be surprised to see actual results well in excess of our current estimates."" Tindle added that, for longer-term investors, CrowdStrike — with its detection and response services — will be a beneficiary of the value chain in cybersecurity shifting from proactive to reactive, given that high-profile security breaches have become seemingly inevitable. CrowdStrike's customer base is also roughly half the size of peers Palo Alto Networks and a fraction of Fortinet's, suggesting room to grow in customer acquisition. These shifts should drive operating leverage and cash flow generation, according to the analyst. Shares gained 0.4% in premarket trading. Tindle acknowledged that the stock — which has gained about 17.8% so far this year — is one of the most expensive in the firm's coverage universe, and that downside from valuation multiple compression could be significant at more than 50%. — Pia Singh 5:42 a.m.: Spotify gets an upgrade from UBS as efficiency initiatives play out UBS thinks Spotify still has room to run as the streaming giant focuses on margin expansion, price increases as well as subscription and advertising growth. These initiatives, in turn, should lead to higher earnings and revenue, according to the firm. Analyst Batya Levi upgraded shares of Spotify to buy from neutral and increased his price target by $104 to $274, which implies 25.3% potential upside for the stock. ""We think efficiency initiatives remain the focus and have increased conviction on sustainable margin expansion and stronger bottom line trends in the coming years,"" Levi wrote in a Tuesday note. ""While investors have struggled in the past with valuation given lack of profitability, we expect SPOT to gain valuation support with EBITDA now firmly in positive territory and growth pegged against peers."" The analyst said Spotify's podcast business is on track to break-even in the first half of this year, and that its music segment should also benefit from new royalty deals with labels, which should support ad-supported margins. Revenue should grow 13% CAGR between 2023 and 2027, and gross margins should also expand during that period, Levi said. The stock is up more than 16% higher this year, and jumped more than 118% over the past year. Shares traded about 2% higher in premarket trading. — Pia Singh 5:42 a.m.: Raymond James downgrades AMD Artificial intelligence expectations for AMD are becoming too elevated, according to Raymond James. The firm lowered its rating on the chipmaker to outperform from strong buy. It also raised its price target to $195 per share from $190, but that only implies upside of 9.6%. ""We project AMD's base business to earn $3.5-4 in 2025, which means AI GPUs will need to contribute > $3 EPS. That is equivalent to $12B revenue or 800k units,"" wrote analyst Srini Pajjuri. ""In comparison, we estimate NVDA shipped 2M units in CY23 and are projecting 3.2M units for CY25. While ~20% unit share is not impossible, we think it's a little premature to give the benefit of the doubt."" AMD shares dipped slightly in the premarket.

Analyst Betsy Graseck raised her rating on Bank of America and Goldman Sachs to overweight from equal weight. She also upgraded Citigroup to overweight from underweight. Broadly, she cited three reasons for her optimism on the major banks: Risks from upcoming ""Basel Endgame"" rules ""coming into focus: ""Reading the tea leaves, it looks like Basel Endgame will be significantly lightened up vs. the current proposal."" The possibility of greater buybacks, ""especially given large banks have the highest excess capital levels ever in an environment where loan growth is tepid."" ""Our conviction in a capital markets rebound is growing."" Specifically for BofA, Graseck said the stock is now trading at an attractive valuation, adding the banking giant benefits from a ""strong consumer deposit franchise, with 92% of consumer checking accounts being primary accounts and 67% of deposit balances being with customers that have been at BAC for more than 10 years."" The analyst raised her price target on Bank of America to $41 from $32. The new forecast implies upside of nearly 22%. Graseck also called Citigroup ""the biggest beneficiary among the money centers from potentially lighter Basel Endgame rules as their stock trades at only 0.5x [book value per share]. That means they have the ability to buy back stock below book, a very accretive financial transaction."" Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Citigroup to $65 from $46, implying upside of 20.1% over the next 12 months. As for Goldman, Graseck noted it's the bank with the most exposure to a ""capital markets rebound, with 64% of revenues coming from Global Banking & Markets in 2024 in our model."" She raised her price target on the stock to $449 from $333, implying 18% upside. Bank of America and Goldman shares are off to a sluggish start for 2024, losing 0.2% and 1.4%, respectively.

New data indicates a surge in cyberattacks, bolstering our view that demand for Palo Alto's software and services to protect large-scale computer systems is bound to rise further in 2024. Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 – the firm's threat intelligence group – indicated a 49% jump last year in so-called ransomware leak sites, which are used by hackers to post stolen data. The firm's Ransomware Retrospective analysis , released on Monday, found 3,998 posts from ransomware leak sites in 2023. This compares to 2,679 posts in 2022. Unit 42 said there's been a ""continued attraction of ransomware as a profitable criminal activity,"" citing at least at least 25 new ransomware groups emerging last year. The report also tracks with recent findings from Corvus, a cyber insurance firm, which said the fourth quarter of 2023 ended a ""record-breaking year"" for ransomware activity. The number of victims reported for the quarter was up 69% year-over-year, according to Corvus data released last week. Palo Alto Networks, along with other cybersecurity names such as Fortinet and Zscaler , are all set up to profit from the growing threat of emboldened hackers. As these threats intensify for businesses, more customers are seeking out products and services like those offered by Palo Alto. That's evident in Palo Alto's 24% year-to-date stock gain on top of more than doubling last year. PANW YTD mountain Palo Alto Networks (PANW) year-to-date performance Nikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks, echoed these sentiments during a CNBC interview last month, saying ""cybersecurity will be a theme for a while"" as the world becomes more ""technologically dependent"" and vulnerable to breaches. Club name Microsoft found itself victim of a breach by a Russian intelligence group just weeks into the new year. To be sure, the company has since said the issue has been resolved. But the breach highlights that even the world's biggest tech names are vulnerable to threats, presenting challenges for Microsoft's own $20 billion-a-year cybersecurity franchise. Wall Street analysts saw Palo Alto and its peers as beneficiaries of the Microsoft attack. JPMorgan said shortly after the breach that it ""could drive greater levels of caution with regard to relying too heavily on Microsoft for security."" Vendors such as Palo Alto that ""compete with Microsoft in their core markets will benefit,"" the analysts wrote. Jim Cramer echoed Wall Street's call at the time, describing Palo Alto's stock as ""sensational"" and adding that shares are clearly not done climbing higher. Fast forward to Wednesday's Homestretch , Jim reiterated his love for Palo Alto after Fortinet's rosy earnings results. ""If the worst cybersecurity stock does well, what does it say about the best? Buy Palo Alto Networks,"" he said. Palo Alto Networks became the first cybersecurity stock to top a $100 billion market value late last year — a long-held goal by management. It closed above the level for the first time on Jan. 11 and hasn't looked back. During Thursday's trading session, the stock's market cap was over $116 billion.

Tom Alison, the head of Facebook, said part of Meta's ""technology roadmap that goes to 2026"" involves developing an AI recommendation model that can power both the company's TikTok-like Reels short video service and more traditional, longer videos.

To date, Meta has typically used a separate model for each of its products, such as Reels, Groups and the core Facebook Feed, Alison said onstage at Morgan Stanley's tech conference in San Francisco.

As part of Meta's ambitious foray into AI, the company has been spending billions of dollars on Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs. They've become the primary chips used by AI researchers for training the types of large language models used to power OpenAI's popular ChatGPT chatbot and other generative AI models.

Alison said ""phase 1"" of Meta's tech roadmap involved switching the company's current recommendation systems to GPUs from more traditional computer chips, helping to improve the overall performance of products.

As interest in LLMs exploded last year, Meta executives were struck by how these big AI models could ""handle lots of data and all kinds of very general-purpose types of activities like chatting,"" Alison said. Meta came to see the possibility of a giant recommendation model that could be used across products, and by last year, built ""this kind of new model architecture,"" Alison said, adding that the company tested it on Reels.

This new ""model architecture"" helped Facebook obtain ""an 8% to 10% gain in Reels watch time"" on the core Facebook app, which Alison said helped prove that the model was ""learning from the data much more efficiently than the previous generation.""

""We've really focused on kind of investing more in making sure that we can scale these models up with the right kind of hardware,"" he said.

Meta is now in ""phase 3"" of its re-architecture of the system, which involves trying to validate the technology and push it across multiple products.",3/6/2024,0,0.010995581,0.845713079,0.002439133,0.122366711,0.016664062,0.001821385

The yellow metal does well when other assets — and the world — are in trouble.

As a result, prospective buyers should proceed with caution, experts say. Be prepared to root against your investment, said William Bernstein, author of ""The Four Pillars of Investing.""

""You buy gold and hope it doesn't go up,"" he said.

Earlier this week, the gold contract for April gained $30.60, or 1.46%, to settle at $2,126.30 per ounce, the highest level dating back to the contract's creation in 1974. On Wednesday, the metal was trading at $2,158.40.

The safe-haven asset has risen for two consecutive months amid ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza, the upcoming presidential election, and uncertainty around interest rates and inflation.

Russian President Vladimir Putin recently warned of nuclear conflict and ""the destruction of civilization"" if other countries sent ground troops into Ukraine. Meanwhile, experts are concerned that Donald Trump would try to pull the U.S. out of NATO if he was reelected, which could raise security risks across the world.

Jeremy Sylestine, a Democratic challenger to the incumbent José Garza, was defeated early on Super Tuesday, with Garza winning by over 30 points. Musk appears to have deleted his post on social media site X endorsing Sylestine.

Sylestine ran on a platform to prosecute more cases, invest in public safety initiatives and rely on more jury trials. Musk, who relocated from California to Texas several years ago and subsequently moved Tesla's headquarters from Silicon Valley to Austin, has been increasingly vocal about politics and reportedly met with former President Donald Trump in Florida over the weekend.

Texas is also home to a major SpaceX facility and The Boring Company, two of Musk's other companies.

Musk wrote Wednesday on X that he will ""not directly donate money"" to either candidate for president in 2024, but he and his companies have contributed to political action committees and campaign committees in the past, according to records posted on OpenSecrets.org.

Here's what Musk wrote to employees on Tuesday in an email that was obtained by CNBC.

From: Elon Musk To: All Date: March 5, 2024 This mainly applies if you live in the greater Austin area, but, if you do, please vote today for a new district attorney who will actually prosecute crime. High time for change throughout the world!

Musk included a link to his since-deleted post on X, which said, ""Sorry to bother everyone with this note as it applies to people in the greater Austin area, but please go to the polls and vote for a new District Attorney!""

Musk then sent a second companywide email, which read, ""Worth noting that Jeremy Sylestine is a moderate Democrat, not a Republican. He is running against a far left incumbent in the primary.""

Bloomberg was first to report on Musk's emails.

Sylestine didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

Tesla operates its largest U.S. vehicle assembly plant in Travis County, home to Austin.

While Musk has presented himself as an independent voter who previously supported presidential candidates including his friend Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, and Andrew Yang, his public political commentary has been moving rightward for years. In a stream of posts on X on Tuesday, he accused President Joe Biden of ""treason,"" without providing evidence.

Musk supported Texas Republican Mayra Flores in her congressional race in 2022. He's now backing Marty O'Donnell, a composer of music for popular video games, who's running as a Republican for Congress in Nevada.

""I hope more people like Marty run for office,"" Musk wrote on X on Tuesday, recirculating a post from O'Donnell.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell endorsed Donald Trump for president Wednesday, putting aside years of hostilities between the two top Republicans.

McConnell's announcement cements Trump's support among leading GOP members of Congress as he is on track to face President Joe Biden in November in a rematch of the 2020 election.

""It is abundantly clear that former President Trump has earned the requisite support of Republican voters to be our nominee for President of the United States,"" McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement.

""It should come as no surprise that as nominee, he will have my support,"" said McConnell, who last week announced he would step down from his leadership position in the Senate in November.

""During his Presidency, we worked together to accomplish great things for the American people including tax reform that supercharged our economy and a generational change of our federal judiciary — most importantly, the Supreme Court,"" he said.

""I look forward to the opportunity of switching from playing defense against the terrible policies the Biden administration has pursued to a sustained offense geared towards making a real difference in improving the lives of the American people.""

A Trump campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

McConnell's announcement was issued minutes after former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley suspended her campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

Haley, who was Trump's last remaining major GOP primary competitor, did not endorse him in the statement announcing the suspension.

McConnell, who has been a Senate leader for 17 years, and Trump, the de facto head of the GOP, have repeatedly clashed since Trump was elected president in 2016.

But McConnell's decision to back Trump was not unexpected.

Just after Trump's impeachment trial on charges of inciting the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, McConnell declared on the Senate floor that there was ""no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.""

But McConnell voted against convicting Trump of the charges, as did more than enough other Republican senators to acquit the ex-president.

Just one month after the trial, McConnell told Fox News that he would ""absolutely"" back Trump if he became the 2024 Republican presidential nominee.

More recently, McConnell and his allies have sparred with Trump's supporters over efforts for the U.S. to send additional aid to Ukraine, which the Senate leader supports.

Trump has attacked McConnell with an array of nicknames, including ""broken old crow,"" and has lobbed racist insults at McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, who served as Labor secretary in the Trump administration.

Although Trump and McConnell haven't spoken face to face in years, aides to both men in recent months discussed an endorsement by the senator, NBC News reported in late February.

Later Wednesday, Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, who chairs the Senate Republican Policy Committee, endorsed Trump.

""We must beat Joe Biden and get this country back on track. Donald Trump has my support,"" Ernst tweeted.

With Ernst's announcement, the entire Senate GOP leadership has now lined up behind Trump.

Mortgage applications to purchase a home increased 11% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. Demand was still 8% lower than the same week one year ago.

The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($766,550 or less) decreased to 7.02% from 7.04%, with points unchanged at 0.67 (including the origination fee) for loans with a 20% down payment.

""Of note, purchase volume – particularly for FHA loans – was up strongly, again showing how sensitive the first-time homebuyer segment is to relatively small changes in the direction of rates,"" said Mike Fratantoni, senior vice president and chief economist at the MBA. ""Other sources of housing data are showing increases in new listings, which is a real positive for the spring buying season given the lack of for-sale inventory.""

There were 14.8% more homes actively for sale in February compared with the same time last year, according to Realtor.com. Notably, homes priced in the $200,000 to $350,000 range grew by 25% from a year ago, outpacing all other price categories.

""The first couple of months of 2024 have proven to be positive for inventory levels, as the number of homes actively for sale was at its highest level since 2020,"" said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com, who noted that while supply is still well below pre-pandemic levels, the South, where homes are less expensive, is leading the charge.

Applications to refinance a home loan increased 8% for the week and were 2% lower than the same week one year ago. The rise has less to do with the small drop in rates and is more likely due to the number being so low that any weekly move in either direction is outsized in the percentage change.

OpenAI said, ""We intend to move to dismiss all of Elon's claims.""

The reproduced messages follow a starkly different point of view Musk represented last week, when he sued OpenAI , CEO Sam Altman and President Greg Brockman, alleging breach of contract and unfair competition.

In its response, OpenAI reproduced old emails from Musk in which the Tesla and SpaceX CEO encouraged the rising startup to raise at least $1 billion in funding, and agreed that it should ""start being less open"" over time and ""not share"" the company's science with the public.

OpenAI on Tuesday publicly responded to a lawsuit brought by co-founder Elon Musk , highlighting apparent hypocrisy on the part of the now-billionaire and early backer of the company.

In November, Musk told an audience at The New York Times' DealBook conference that OpenAI had deviated from its original mission in his view.

""OpenAI should be renamed 'super closed source for maximum profit AI,' because this is what it actually is,"" Musk said onstage at the event. He noted that it's transformed from an ""open source foundation"" to a multibillion-dollar ""for-profit corporation with closed source.""

By contrast, Musk appeared to discourage OpenAI co-founders from taking a too-lean approach to fundraising, according to emails the company reproduced from December 2018. He wrote that OpenAI had a zero-percent chance of becoming a relevant competitor to Google's DeepMind unless the startup made a ""dramatic change in execution and resources.""

""My probability assessment of OpenAI being relevant to DeepMind/Google without a dramatic change in execution and resources is 0%. Not 1%. I wish it were otherwise,"" Musk wrote in one email to fellow OpenAI co-founders Ilya Sutskever, Brockman and Altman. ""Even raising several hundred million won't be enough. This needs billions per year immediately or forget it.""

Musk is now CEO of automaker Tesla, defense contractor SpaceX and the owner of X Corp., as well as the founder of brain computer interface startup Neuralink, and a would-be competitor to OpenAI that he named xAI.

Before he left OpenAI, the company said in its response to his lawsuit, ""Elon wanted majority equity, initial board control, and to be CEO"" of the artificial intelligence venture. The startup also said in its blog post that Musk sought to become OpenAI's CEO in 2017 as it was changing its structure.

Musk's companies have, at times, attracted talent away from OpenAI. In the case of xAI, Musk positions the company's first product, Grok, as competitive with OpenAI's software ChatGPT.

In emails from January 2018 reproduced by OpenAI, Musk agrees with an unnamed sender who encouraged the startup's co-founders to rely on Tesla as their ""cash cow."" Going into the first quarter of 2018, Tesla reported a cash balance of $3.4 billion, after it posted a net loss of $2.24 billion for the full year in 2017 on revenue that year of $11.8 billion.

Companies added 140,000 positions for the month, an increase from the upwardly revised 111,000 in January but a bit below the Dow Jones estimate for 150,000.

Job gains came across multiple areas, led by leisure and hospitality with 41,000 and construction, which added 28,000 positions. Other industries showing solid gains included trade, transportation and utilities (24,000), finance (17,000), and the other services category (14,000).

Of the total, 110,000 came from the services sector while goods producers added 30,000. Growth was concentrated among larger companies, as establishments with fewer than 50 employees contributed just 13,000 to the total.

Along with the job growth, annual pay increased 5.1% for those staying in their jobs, which ADP said was the smallest rise since August 2021, a potential indication that inflation pressures are receding.

The report comes with the labor market getting added attention for signals of whether U.S. economic growth will stall this year after gross domestic product posted a solid 2.5% annualized gain in 2023.

""Job gains remain solid. Pay gains are trending lower but are still above inflation,"" said ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson. ""In short, the labor market is dynamic, but doesn't tip the scales in terms of a Fed rate decision this year.""

ADP's report precedes the Labor Department's official nonfarm payrolls release, which is scheduled for Friday. In recent months, ADP has consistently undershot the closely watched report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which showed an increase of 353,000 in January, more than triple the ADP estimate.

Economists surveyed by Dow Jones are expecting Friday's report to show a rise of 198,000.

Consumers have been increasingly relying on credit cards to make ends meet, and it may be finally catching up with them. The national average credit score, which has steadily increased over the last decade, fell to 717 from a high of 718 in the beginning of 2023, according to a report from FICO, developer of one of the scores most widely used by lenders. FICO scores range between 300 and 850. ""It's a notable milestone,"" said Ethan Dornhelm, FICO's vice president of scores and predictive analytics. ""This is the first time in well over a decade that the score went down.""

Average nationwide credit scores bottomed out at 686 during the housing crisis more than a decade ago, when there was a sharp increase in foreclosures. They steadily ticked higher until the Covid-19 pandemic, when government stimulus programs and a spike in household saving helped scores jump to a historic high in April 2023.

Consumers are falling deeper in debt

High interest rates and higher prices have weighed on most Americans' financial standing. Consumers as a whole are falling deeper into debt, causing an increase in credit card balances and an uptick in missed payments, FICO found. As of October, the average credit card utilization was 35%, up from 33% a year earlier, and just over 18% of borrowers had a more than 30-day past-due missed payment against their credit accounts, up from 16.5% the year before. ""Another likely driver is that savings rates have trended back down to zero and those savings cushions that many consumers had have disappeared,"" Dornhelm said. More from Personal Finance:

Average credit card balances jump 10% to a record $6,360

Credit card debt hits a 'staggering' $1.13 trillion

Americans can't pay an unexpected $1,000 expense During the pandemic, most Americans benefited from a few government-supplied safety nets, including the large injection of stimulus money. That left many households sitting on a stockpile of cash that enabled some cardholders to keep their credit card balances in check. But that cash reserve is largely gone after consumers gradually spent down their excess savings. ""We are pretty far removed from pandemic-level mitigation programs, so consumers are very much confronted with making good on their credit obligations with little in the way of stimulus checks or government defined accommodation programs,"" Dornhelm said.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday he will not donate to the campaigns of either President Joe Biden or former President Donald Trump.

""Just to be super clear, I am not donating money to either candidate for US President,"" Musk said in a post on his social media site X.

Musk's tweet came a day after The New York Times reported that last weekend he met with Trump and what the newspaper called a few wealthy Republican donors, in Palm Beach, Florida. The former president's home, in his Mar-a-Lago club, is in Palm Beach.

Musk is one of the wealthiest people in the world, with an estimated net worth of $195 billion, according to Forbes.

Musk, who also heads SpaceX, could support Trump or Biden in ways other than a direct donation to their campaigns.

He could, for instance, donate to a political action committee backing either contender.

Any major donation he makes could have a significant impact on a candidate's campaign.

Musk did not respond to an email seeking comment on whether he plans to give to a pro-Biden or pro-Trump PAC.

Despite Musk's habit of taking political stances on social media, he is not a major, frequent donor to campaigns.

Musk during the 2018 midterm election cycle made a series of contributions to Republican and Democratic committees supporting candidates for Congress for $33,900 apiece.

Roughly 20% of S & P 500 companies are set to report next week, including pharmaceutical titans such as Eli Lilly and Vertex Pharmaceuticals , and stocks ranging from McDonald's to Walt Disney to Uber Technologies . So far, more than 200 companies in the S & P 500 have reported fourth quarter earnings. But even though about 74% of companies in the S & P 500 have topped analyst expectations, earnings beats are the lowest in four quarters, London-based Societe Generale strategist Manish Kabra said in a Thursday note. Against this backdrop, CNBC Pro looked for S & P 500 names reporting next week that met the following criteria: At least 8 upward earnings-per-share estimate revisions in past 3 months Average earnings-per-share estimate is up 5% or more in past 3 months Average earnings-per-share estimate is up 1% or more in past 6 months Average analyst price target is up 10% or more in past three months Here are the companies that made the cut: Average price targets for Allstate have climbed nearly 25% in the past three months, the highest of any stock that surfaced in the screen. The insurer is set to report earnings on Feb. 7. Shares have soared 11.6% year-to-date and about 22% over the past year as the insurance market grew more attractive , benefiting from both strong premium pricing and easier inflationary pressures. Analysts' consensus price target of $161 suggests roughly 3% potential upside from Allstate's recent close. Morgan Stanley called Allstate an ""underappreciated story in a favorable market environment"" in a Jan. 4 note, upgrading the carrier to overweight from equal weight. According to analyst Bob Jian Huang, Allstate could see better earnings growth this year due to faster growth in the personal auto business coupled with smaller underwriting losses. Vertex Pharmaceuticals has gained favor among analysts over the past few months, as the stock has risen 6.6% since the start of the year and 36% over the past 12 months. Earnings are set for release on Feb. 5. The company's earnings per share estimates are up about 14% in the past three months, after analysts made 21 upward revisions. According to FactSet, analysts' consensus price target of $443 suggests an upside of 2.1% from Thursday's close. Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter is bullish on Vertex's acute pain and chronic pain treatments, as well as data from its next potentially revenue-boosting cystic fibrosis therapy expected in the first quarter, she wrote in a Tuesday note. Richter maintained her buy rating on the company and raised her price target by $117 to $559, which implies nearly 29% potential upside. JPMorgan also raised its price target on the stock on Thursday. Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies , which reports earnings on Feb. 7, has seen its earnings estimates bumped higher 27 times by analysts in the past three months. Over the same span, analysts hiked their average price target by roughly 17%. Uber ended 2023 on a strong note and is seeing better profit margins, according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post, who recently raised his price target for Uber to $73 per share. That implies the stock, which entered the S & P 500 in December, could gain another 9% from Thursday's close. Shares soared more than 120% last year as Uber generated higher global operating cash flow higher and implemented cost-cutting efforts. ""Looking forward, we see Uber as offering one of the best 3-5 year growth profiles in the Internet sector, with potential for mid-to-high teens bookings growth and 30% EBITDA growth,"" Post wrote in a Monday note.

Watercoolers and cubicles are dens of distrust when it comes to artificial intelligence, which has emerged as a significant force over the past year.

While both rank-and-file workers and the C-suite see AI as a great opportunity for business transformation, both sides are skeptical over its deployment. The recent rise in layoffs, especially in the tech sector, isn't helping to stem that distrust either.

Experts say that while there is widespread AI anxiety no matter which side of the desk a person sits on, having leaders enthusiastic about AI as well as providing clear communication on how it will impact and alter employee jobs is critical for its long-term success.

""There is a lot of anxiety around, but there are actually a lot of opportunities, and employees aren't getting that message because employers aren't getting that message,"" said Emily Rose McRae, a senior director and analyst at Gartner who leads its future of work teams. McRae said many employers have anxiety over AI and pass that on to their employees. Employers, McRae said, need to better educate themselves about the opportunities and benefits of AI. And then, she added: ""People need to hear from employers, 'Here are our plans.'""

According to a recent survey from HR software company Workday, 62% of business leaders welcome AI's arrival in the workplace. Employees are even more tepid in embracing AI, with just 52% welcoming it.

McRae said that employers are often uncertain about where or how to deploy AI, leading to some trepidation. Once they see how AI can increase productivity and create new opportunities, they'll spread their enthusiasm for AI to employees. However, they must communicate clearly and show how AI will help workers.

""There is media messaging that AI will take jobs, and vendors are pushing products that show how you can use AI to eliminate jobs, so people are anxious about it,"" McRae said.

McRae said that employers should explain that if an employee's role needs to be reimagined, they'll have a conversation and see other ways the employee can contribute to the company.

""The core business we see as healthy,"" Gelsinger said. ""We see no areas for market share loss and the products are getting stronger.""

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on a call with analysts that the core businesses — PC and server chips — would be at the low end of the company's seasonal range in the current quarter, but that overall sales would take a hit because of weakness in subsidiaries including Mobileye and its programmable chip unit, as well as revenue decreases from other businesses the company has spun off or sold.

For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects adjusted earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue. The company projects a fiscal first-quarter net loss of 25 cents per share on a GAAP basis.

Here's how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December:

Intel shares dropped more than 10% on Friday after the chipmaker issued an outlook for the first quarter of 2024 that lagged analyst forecasts even as results for the latest quarter beat Wall Street estimates.

Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $700 million, or 16 cents per share, last year.

With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue. Intel's full-year gross margin was 40%, down 2.6 percentage points annually.

Intel shares are up more than 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street.

Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia's recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs.

""The data center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters,"" said Intel CFO David Zinsner on a call with analysts Thursday.

Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips.

""The quarter capped a year of tremendous progress on Intel's transformation,"" Gelsinger said in a statement. Intel said Thursday that it would restate past results under a new system where the company has to account for costs related to internal manufacturing of its own chips.

Intel Foundry Services, its business making chips for other companies, remains nascent, with $291 million in revenue, a 63% annual increase.

Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022. Zinsner said that Intel had cut $3 billion in costs last year and the company spun off or sold five different business lines.

Intel's largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%.

Gelsinger said that demand for PC chips had ""normalized,"" and that sales were strong in the gaming and commercial sectors. He added that Intel expects the total PC market to expand this year.

Intel's second-biggest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs. Intel's Network and Edge department, which sells parts for carriers and networking, reported $1.5 billion in sales, down 24% from last year.

Zinsner said that Intel expected its Data Center business to decline ""double-digit"" percentages sequentially in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter.

Intel said it paid $3.1 billion in dividends in 2023.

How could so many prognosticators be so wrong about consumer inflation, the economic data, the trajectory of Federal Reserve interest rates? Isn't that the real conundrum? That's why I said in my Sunday column that I'm trying to ignore all this rate talk and concentrate on earnings seasons, which kicks off in earnest this week.

""On Day 2 of our trip to the West Coast, we went from booth to booth at the most exciting trade show on earth, and I marveled at what the non-tech companies are doing with Nvidia's accelerated computing and generative AI technology,"" he said. ""I think the non-tech partners could represent the best opportunities because they fly under the radar compared to the megacap techs that we're always hearing about and talking about.""

He first named image companies Getty and Shutterstock , saying they have had stagnant revenues over the last few years but that their dealings with Nvidia could spur business. To Cramer, investors should reassess the value of these companies in part because their images can help train new AI models.

Nvidia has numerous partnerships across the health-care sector, including with Medtronic to create a more effective endoscopy module to better detect colorectal cancer. GE Healthcare and Johnson & Johnson are also working with Nvidia.

While these partnerships haven't necessarily increased these companies' earnings just yet, he said sometimes it's important to ""work backwards"" when picking stocks. Cramer also encouraged investors to search for market winners at events like Nvidia's conference.

""The knowledge isn't always in the conference call or the analyst reports — sometimes it's right here, like the purloined letter, hidden in glorious plain sight,"" he said. ""You just have to get off the desk and find it by going to the GPU technology conference of Nvidia and seeing who's showing off their wares at the most important AI event of the year.""",3/19/2024,0,0.000773798,0.987015605,0.000568054,0.001112656,0.001151786,0.009378235

(We're no longer recording the audio, so we can get this new written feature to members as quickly as possible.) Fundamentals over Fed: Markets shrugged off the slightly warmer-than-expected February consumer price index report , which did not change Wall Street's view of a possible Federal Reserve interest rate cut as early as June. If you had told us at this time Monday that CPI was going to be elevated and yields on the 2-year and 10-year Treasury notes would rise, we would have figured the market was due for another down day. Instead, investors shifted their focus back to earnings, which is the principal driver of stocks in the long run. Upbeat commentary Monday night from Oracle brought investors back into the Nvidia-led artificial intelligence, Nasdaq and momentum trade after a few days of rest. The tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped more than 1% Tuesday, while Nvidia added more than 5%. GE Healthcare updates: GE Healthcare CFO Jay Saccaro spoke at Oppenheimer's annual Healthcare MedTech & Services conference. The conversation generally served as a reiteration of the investment case rather than offering the latest information on business trends. For example, Saccaro pointed out that China, which represents about 14% of GE Healthcare's business, is an important market, but also is ""not absolutely crucial."" The company's business in China is expected to have a lopsided 2024, with growth concentrated in the back half of the year, following an uneven 2023. Last year, its revenue surged 20% organically in the first six months due to government stimulus measures before going through a rough patch in the second half due to Beijing's anti-corporation campaigns in the health-care industry. Still, GE Healthcare is navigating China much more adeptly than its peers, creating a source of upside versus expectations over the past couple of quarters. From a business development point of view, Saccaro reiterated management's focus on increasing investment in research and development while at the same time expanding margins, something the bears didn't think was possible before GE Healthcare issued its 2024 outlook last month. The company's focus on R & D and integrating AI into devices helped it have more AI-enabled technologies and platforms approved by U.S. regulators than its peers last year. This is a big deal because not only do these digital products help solve health problems more efficiently, but in some cases they also will carry a higher price point, which further helps the company's broader price strategy. Lastly, we heard more ways the company is looking to reduce complexities and corporate costs in year two as standalone company. In terms of capital allocation, R & D and capital expenditures are the main priorities ""because those are the most bankable"" areas for driving a return on investment, Saccaro said. After that, management is focused on tuck-in acquisitions and improving the balance sheet. Saccaro expects GE Healthcare to commence stock buybacks at some point, but that's still down the road. GE Healthcare shares fell about 1% Tuesday, but the move doesn't seem tied to the presentation. The stock made a new all-time closing high Friday, at $93.87 per share. Later: It will be pretty quiet on the earnings radar over the next 24 hours. Two notable companies reporting Wednesday are Dollar Tree and Williams-Sonoma . There are no major economic data points until Thursday, when we get both February wholesale inflation data and retail sales.

263,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/09/google-partners-with-bayer-on-new-ai-product-for-radiologists.html,GEHC,GE HealthCare,Google partners with Bayer on new AI product for radiologists,"Google Cloud and the German health-care company Bayer on Tuesday announced they are building an artificial intelligence-powered platform that aims to help radiologists diagnose patients and work through cases more quickly.

The platform's generative AI flags anomalies within images for radiologists to look at, and it can also pull up relevant information from that patient's medical history, Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, told CNBC. If a patient comes in for an annual breast cancer screening, for example, the platform can detect current problems, compare the image to prior screenings and summarize that information, he said.

Health-care companies like Bayer will be able to use the platform to develop radiology-specific applications that carry out functions like these more easily, Google said.

A radiologist is a doctor who uses medical images like CT scans, MRIs and X-rays to identify and treat conditions. But like physicians across many specialties in the U.S., radiologists are facing a growing labor shortage, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. As of early April, there are more than 1,800 vacant job postings on the American College of Radiology's website, compared to around 220 listings in April 2014.

Many radiologists are also fighting burnout as an aging population, and easier access to imaging technologies have led to mounting caseloads. Google Cloud said its new platform could help alleviate these ongoing workforce challenges.

""That whole process flow is designed to help radiologists get through their task with assistance more quickly,"" Kurian said in an interview. ""It makes them more efficient so they can actually see more images and service more patients.""

Kurian said the platform does not replace radiologists, as the doctor still maintains ""sole control"" of the recommendation they will make. Instead, he wants people to look at the platform as an assistive tool, like a microscope. The goal is to easily give radiologists the information they need and save them from spending 15 or 20 minutes searching through patient records, Kurian said.

Google Cloud and Bayer are not the only companies exploring AI applications for medical imaging. In 2021, the Netherlands-based health-care company Philips and Amazon Web Services said they are working to use AI to analyze medical imaging data. Similarly, GE HealthCare published a blog post in 2022 about the various AI tools it has developed for radiology.

Keith Kirkpatrick, research director at The Futurum Group, said there's not one clear leader in the medical imaging AI market yet since the technology is still so new.

""It's really wide open,"" Kirkpatrick told CNBC. ""We're still fairly early in the game right now.""

Kirkpatrick, who was briefed on Tuesday's announcement, said Google Cloud and Bayer's radiology platform will have to demonstrate high levels of technical accuracy, offer strong privacy and security controls and be easy to use in order to win in the space. Establishing trust with radiologists will be the key, he added.

""Google is going to have to make sure that their technology is as close to foolproof as possible,"" Kirkpatrick said.

Google Cloud has been working with Bayer on the radiology platform for around five years. The foundation was built using existing Google Cloud solutions like Vertex AI, Healthcare API and BigQuery, and Kurian said the platform's data is encrypted.

The companies drew on Bayer's expertise in radiology to make sure that the product is easy for the doctors to use. Bayer said its radiology products generated around €2 billion (US$2.16 billion) in sales last year, according to a release.

Even so, the platform represents a foray into an entirely new business model for Bayer, according to Guido Mathews, Bayer's vice president of radiology.

""We don't offer a new pill — we offer a service for which we will charge users accordingly,"" Mathews told CNBC in an interview. ""To help develop models and also to help deploy models for radiology, that's a big step forward for us.""

Google Cloud and Bayer are exploring a number of different pricing models for the platform, he said. Other health-care organizations will begin testing and providing feedback on the platform this year.",4/9/2024,-1,0.008230822,0.900185108,0.001846369,0.055017862,0.032874037,0.001845862

(We're no longer recording the audio, so we can get this new written feature to members as quickly as possible.) Market pullback: Stocks took a bit of a dive on no news shortly after the Morning Meeting wrapped up but have clawed back some losses. The decline came even as Treasury yields and oil moved lower. Both have been market headwinds lately. Real estate, utilities, and consumer staples outperformed while financials, industrials, and energy lagged. Nvidia vs. Intel?: One of the stocks that led to the downside mid-morning was Nvidia . We initially thought the decline was on no news, but then Intel issued a press release mid-day about its new AI chip, called Gaudi 3, which the company claims is better at training and inference than Nvidia's H100. Intel also claims it's more power-efficient than Nvidia's chips at a competitive price point. Intel shares were up about 1% in trading while Nvidia fell more than 2%. Intel shares are off about 24% in 2024 compared to Nvidia's 71% gain. While we never want to write off a new competitive threat at first blush, we are skeptical that Intel has something here. Given the company's track record, it is not surprising to us that its stock isn't working after these much-ballyhooed claims. That's because it has been one of the biggest overpromise-underdeliver companies in all of tech. We've seen Intel make similar claims with its previous generation Gaudi 2, and nothing has come from it. We'll do more work on this announcement, but as of now, we can't take this seriously. Upgrades/downgrades: Bank earnings season kicks off this Friday with Wells Fargo , JPMorgan , and Citigroup scheduled to report. Ahead of earnings, Wells Fargo was downgraded to neutral by a research firm called Compass Point Wells has also been downgraded by KBW and Citi since the start of March with valuation being a point of debate following the stock's strong gains in 2024. ""I know that Wells Fargo has moved and there have been a lot of downgrades but I would point out that this stock was at $62 six years ago when the market was much much lower,"" said Jim Cramer. ""It is well behind the market."" Wells Fargo will report its first-quarter earnings Friday before the opening bell. Meanwhile, Cramer is critical of an upgrade of Freeport-McMoRan after the stock has gained 35% since the beginning of March. ""I do not like this recommendation of Freeport,"" Cramer said. ""It is coming in after a parabolic move. That's ill-advised."" Other items: Cramer points out that Amazon spiked this morning to a fresh all-time high but it has since reversed lower. ""It's a shame because nothing has happened. Better to wait until you have something."" We are also keeping our eyes on the GE family of companies. "" GE Vernova , even up two, is terrific because it is down a lot from the high,"" Cramer said. ""But GE Healthcare , as it comes down, represents better value. Up next: Wednesday's key event is the March consumer price index (CPI), which measures the changes in prices paid for goods and services by consumers. The index is a good proxy for inflation and could impact monetary policy expectations, which explains why rates and stocks tend to be volatile on CPI day. The index is expected to increase 3.4% year over year, a slight acceleration from 3.2% in February. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, is expected to rise 3.7%, which would be a tick lower from February. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

All times ET. 8:30 a.m.: Wedbush downgrades Lennar, D.R. Horton The homebuilders are about to hit some seasonal weakness, according to Wedbush. Analyst Jay McCanless downgraded a slew of companies including Lennar and D.R. Horton to underperform from neutral, saying the homebuilders are about to see some demand weakness heading into the summer months. ""No year in homebuilding ever follows a precise timeline of perfectly rising demand in the spring followed by a seasonally normal decline in demand into the summer,"" McCanless wrote on Tuesday. ""However, 2024 has been the most ""normal"" year we have seen for the home building industry since 2019 in terms of normal seasonality."" ""Consequently, we believe these names could see a normal seasonal stock price decline into the summer especially after the seasonal trade window (Figure 4, page 4) closes in April/May,"" McCanless added. Lennar shares have risen more than 12% this year. But the analyst's $144 price target, unchanged from previously, represents a 14% fall from Monday's closing price of $167.81. Shares were down by 2.3%. D.R. Horton shares have advanced more than 6% this year. The analyst's $130 price target implies a more than 19% drop for the stock from Monday's close. Shares dropped more than 2%. Other names downgraded to underperform are Century Communities, Meritage Homes and LGI Homes. — Sarah Min 7:40 a.m.: CFRA upgrades DoorDash to buy DoorDash is continuing to grow and improve its fundamentals even as the pandemic gets further in the rearview mirror, according to CFRA. Analyst Shreya Gheewala upgraded the delivery stock to buy from hold, saying in a note to clients that DoorDash was showing strength across the board and should deliver positive earnings by the end of 2024. ""We upgrade our view on DASH due to our increased conviction in the company's accelerating growth trajectory across almost all of its business segments, driven by stickiness of its delivery ecosystem,"" the note said. Current economic conditions should also boost gig economy companies like DoorDash in general, according to CFRA. ""We also see a positive secular trend emerging within the gig economy, thanks to ample supply of labor and rising consumer demand. DASH's asset-light business model is well positioned to capitalize on this trend,"" the note said. — Jesse Pound 7:36 a.m.: Bank of America lowers price target on FedEx following contract loss The end of FedEx's and the U.S. Postal Service's 23-year long partnership will be a headwind for FedEx in the second quarter of 2024, according to Bank of America. On Monday, USPS announced it would switch its air cargo contract to UPS from FedEx. The previous contracts had amounted to as high as $1.5 billion in annual revenues before falling to around break-even levels in the last year. As a result, analyst Ken Hoexter reduced his price target on shares to $340 from $346. Meanwhile, he maintained his buy rating on shares. ""We expect a near-term negative impact (F2Q25) at FedEx as it winds down excess assets used to operate its day sort (pilots, employees),"" Hoexter wrote in a note. — Hakyung Kim 7:25 a.m.: Sell Figs amid tough consumer landscape, BofA recommends After a pandemic-induced boom in scrub demand, Bank of America sees a tough environment for Figs . Analyst Lorraine Hutchinson downgraded the scrub maker to underperform from neutral and chopped her price target by $4 to $4.50. Now, Hutchinson anticipates shares will slip 7.2% in the next year. ""The healthcare worker is now squeezed by inflation and focused on spending on other areas instead of replenishing their uniforms,"" Hutchinson wrote to clients on Tuesday. ""Without a line of sight into an improving macro environment for the core customer that would drive stronger sales, we see few catalysts for multiple expansion."" Hutchinson said the pandemic created a ""pull-forward"" environment for demand, leading to large growth and margins. This high-margin profile has been a ""bright spot"" for the company, though Hutchinson cautioned of a short-term impact due to duplicative costs. At the moment, Hutchinson said there's better opportunity elsewhere in her coverage. While the analyst said a returned focus on marketing should help Figs, it will take time for that to translate into sales. Shares tumbled more than 5% in Tuesday premarket trading following the downgrade. The stock has plunged more than 30% in 2024. — Alex Harring 7:07 a.m.: Meta can gain nearly 12% from current levels, BofA predicts Meta has more upside ahead as internet stocks see multiple expansion, per Bank of America. Analyst Justin Post upped his target price on the Facebook parent by $40 to $550. That new expectation reflects the potential for shares to climb another 11.9% over the next year. Post's price target increase is in line with his move on the GAAP price-to-earnings multiple to 22 from 21. While he said this multiple requires a ""slight premium"" to historical averages, it can be warranted if the big technology company sees growth in advertising tied to artificial intelligence improvements. More broadly, he said a decreased cost of borrowing money can help the multiples of Meta and other large internet names. ""Large cap stocks have had multiple expansion in 1Q 2024, and a lower interest rate environment could drive further expansion,"" Post said. Meta has already jumped nearly 39% in 2024. That adds to the monster rally of more than 190% seen by the Magnificent 7 stock in the prior year. — Alex Harring 6:55 a.m.: Eli Lilly investors can keep 'riding the GLP-1 rocket', Citi says Weight-loss drug excitement can continue to propel Eli Lilly higher despite risks, Citi said. Analyst Andrew Baum increased his price target on the pharmaceutical stock to $895 from $675, now implying a 17.7% gain from Monday's closing level. Baum kept his buy rating. The hike follows growth in anticipated risk-adjusted peak sales for the oral small molecule GLP-1, Baum said. He noted that the risk of drug-related hepato-toxicity is shrinking. Still, Baum said it's important to keep an eye on competitive risks. While there are reasons to believe Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk's competitive advantages could be lowered, the analyst said the pair should be able to retain their dominant market positions and grow into multiples. Ultimately, he said investors can continue ""riding the GLP-1 rocket."" Baum's call comes amid another strong year for Eli Lilly shares, with the stock up more than 30% in 2024. That puts the Indianapolis-based company's stock on track for its eighth straight winning year. — Alex Harring 6:39 a.m.: Melius moves to sidelines on Boeing Boeing has too many areas of concern, Melius Research warned. Analyst Robert Spingarn downgraded the plane maker to hold from buy and slashed his price target by $71 to $209. Spingarn's new target reflects the potential for just 10.3% in upside over Monday's close. ""Overall, we believe Boeing is headed for, and in need of, a multi-year restructuring,"" Spingarn wrote in a note to clients. ""Negative newsflow is also unlikely to abate and will continue to be an overhang on the stock."" The reputational crisis following a midair panel blowout is just one issue for Boeing to deal with in the near- to medium-term, Spingarn said. Among the others: dealing with labor negotiations, finding a new CEO and de-leveraging the balance sheet. Given these challenges, he said the stock should be close to fair value compared with the firm's 2026 estimate for free cash flow at $8.9 billion. That's $1.1 billion below both the predictions of management and the consensus on Wall Street. Boeing has tumbled more than 27% in 2024, making it the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Still, the majority of analysts polled by LSEG have buy ratings on the stock. BA YTD mountain BA year to date — Alex Harring 6:20 a.m.: Citi names Coca-Cola a top idea Coca-Cola won the top-pick distinction among beverage, household and personal care stocks covered by Citi. Analyst Filippo Falorni said the soda maker was the top overall idea, replacing Clorox. He has a buy rating on Coca-Cola shares. Coca-Cola is a stock to like because of its stronger pricing power compared with peers and high exposure to emerging markets, Falorni said. The company's appeal to a tax case could be a ""clearing event"" that allows investors to refocus on fundamentals, he said. As a whole, the analyst noted beverage stocks have better pricing power over the long term. He also said concerns tied to blockbuster weight loss drugs have been ""largely overblown."" ""At a sector level, after large HPC outperformance over the past year, we see the Beverage sector as starting to look more compelling with the valuation gap to HPC having widened,"" he said, using the acronym for household and personal care stocks. Coca-Cola shares have advanced about 3% in 2024, somewhat turning a quarter after sliding more than 7% in the prior year. — Alex Harring 6:07 a.m.: Citi moves off sidelines on Estee Lauder, citing inventory normalization Estee Lauder is on the verge of a turning point as closely watched channel inventories stabilize, Citi said. Analyst Filippo Falorni upgraded the cosmetics stock to buy from neutral and hiked his price target by $15 to $175. Falorni's new target implies the stock can rally 15.1% from Monday's close. Falorni said the stock was hurt in 2023 because of sales and profit degradation. But the Tom Ford and Le Labo parent said it will balance inventories in the Asia Pacific travel retail unit by the end of the third quarter of this year. ""We believe the company is nearing a topline inflection point as channel inventories in Asia Pac Travel Retail are normalizing and EL is closer to balanced sell-in/sell-through,"" he said. Elsewhere, Falorni acknowledged that Estee Lauder has expanded its profit recovery plan for the 2025 and 2026 fiscal years. This can set a baseline for earnings and help the market predict what a path to normalized financials looks like, he said. Shares rose more than 2% in Tuesday premarket trading. The stock has added about 4% so far this year, regaining some ground after sliding more than 41% in 2023 and almost 33% in 2022. EL YTD mountain — Alex Harring 5:52 a.m.: Prolonged real estate recovery can hurt Blackstone, says UBS A slow rebound for real estate can spell bad news for Blackstone , according to UBS. Analyst Brennan Hawken downgraded the investment asset manager to neutral from buy and cut his price target by $5 to $135. With that, Hawken sees an upside of 3% from Monday's close. Performance, net subscriptions and fee-related performance revenues within perpetual real estate strategies have not recovered as fast as some expected, Hawken said. Now, he said to expect 2022 levels in 2026, with ""modest"" numbers next year followed by a ""low-conviction growth forecast."" ""The performance outlook for real estate remains challenged, in our view,"" Hawken told clients. As a result of the landscape, assets under management in the firm's real estate income trust have dropped. Hawken said the tough fee-related performance revenue numbers can weigh down fee-related earnings overall. He said to expect the margin for these earnings to come in around flat, with growth that's considered below average. Still, he said management should be able to grow fees on assets under management in the future. Blackstone is around flat in 2024 despite the broader market uptrend. That marks a pause following 2023's jump of 76.5%. Shares dipped 1% in thin premarket trading. — Alex Harring 5:45 a.m.: Grindr can rally more than 35%, JMP says Grindr shares can advance as the dating platform focused on LGBTQ+ men converts users to paying members, according to JMP. Analyst Nicholas Jones initiated coverage at market outperform. His $14 price target implies an upside of 36.9% over Monday's closing level. Jones said Grindr has a runway to expand monetization by getting users to pay for features. Grindr currently converts users to paying at a rate of 7.1%, which is about half of what other dating apps see. However, JMP expects the percentage of paying customers to tick up to 8% by 2026. The total addressable market can also continue to grow as the LGBTQ+ community does, Jones said. And Grindr's existing customer base is considered involved: Around 10% of users on the app between one and 10 hours a day, compared with 4% for other apps. ""We expect its position to strengthen as it continues to convert its large network of highly engaged users to paying users,"" Jones wrote to clients. Grindr shares have climbed more than 16% in 2024, extending last year's gain of more than 88%. The stock, which went public in late 2022, won its first Wall Street initiation just last week. GRND YTD mountain Grindr in 2024 — Alex Harring 5:45 a.m.: RBC initiates GE Vernova as outperform A newly spun-off company is poised for solid gains ahead, according to RBC. Analyst Christopher Dendrinos initiated GE Vernova, General Electric's power business, with an outperform rating and a price target of $160, implying a gain of 13%. The company will begin trading under the GEV ticker at the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. ""GEV participates across the electrification value chain providing the company with unique perspective and enables it to be an early mover in responding to the growing complexity and demand of electrical networks,"" Dendrinos said. He also said that, as a standalone company, ""GEV will benefit from greater flexibility to pursue high-growth and margin-accretive strategies and will face increased accountability across its business lines with the more focused portfolio."" ""We believe this will help drive an acceleration in cost-out and simplification initiatives and should position the company to exceed its longer-term margin targets,"" the analyst said. — Fred Imbert",4/2/2024,0,0.008349515,0.855364203,0.005445717,0.095301792,0.033851512,0.001687323

Please refresh every 20-30 minutes to view the latest posts.) A major automaker and a key chipmaker were featured among Monday's biggest analyst calls. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Ford after the company reassessed its electric vehicle strategy. KeyBanc also raised its price target on Nvidia and now sees more than 30% upside for the stock. Check out the latest calls and chatter below. All times ET. 8:38 a.m.: Morgan Stanley sees a path for Amazon shares to reach as much as $290 Morgan Stanley has raised its price target on Amazon and reinstated it as its top pick, citing the stock's multiyear, efficiency based cash flow story. Analyst Brian Nowak raised the price target on Amazon to $215 from $200, implying about 16% upside. However, he said the firm's breakdown of the ""cost to serve"" – which includes shipping, fulfillment, payment processing, inbound shipping, returns, and inventory shrinkage costs – gives him ""increased confidence in AMZN's ability to deliver $100bn+ of '26 EBIT and $10-11 of '26 FCF/share."" That ""paints path to ~$230-$290 stock price as we argue AMZN could warrant an even higher multiple in this scenario,"" he added. Shares rose 1% in premarket trading. — Tanaya Macheel 8:36 a.m.: Chipotle shares could rally nearly 16%, says Citi Citi expects a topline beat when Chipotle Mexican Grill reports financial results for its first quarter April 24. The bank hiked its price target on Friday to $3,358 from $3,016, suggesting almost 16% upside from Friday's close. Analyst Jon Tower also anticipates encouraging commentary about momentum through the quarter. ""We would be surprised if we emerge from the quarter with any real holes to poke in the story/anything that drives LT investors away from the name, and a clear path for SSS [same-store sales] drivers, HSD [high single-digit] unit growth, and a 20%-plus EPS [earnings per share] algo should continue to justify a marginal multiple premium vs history,"" he wrote in a note to clients. Tower upped his 2024 EPS estimate to $52.38 from $52.17 and his 2025 EPS estimate to $66.70 from $64.24. Shares of Chipotle are up 27% year to date. — Michelle Fox 7:38 a.m.: Evercore hikes Disney price target, points out near-term catalysts Walt Disney has a bright near-term outlook, according to Evercore ISI. The investment firm increased its price target for the entertainment stock in a Monday note, with analyst Vijay Jayant's new price target of $130 — up from $115 — implying that shares could rally another 10%. At the same time, he stood by his outperform rating on Disney. Jayant cited Disney's new foray into the Indian market as a major catalyst. Specifically, Disney is due to merge its media assets with India's Reliance Industries, with Disney owning a 37% in the joint venture. ""The transaction allows Disney to retain exposure to the Indian market with a strong partner in Reliance Industries,"" the analyst wrote. There are also further opportunities to grow margins as Disney begins cracking down on password sharing. Using Netflix as an example, Jayant thinks there could be 50 million households sharing a Disney+ core service and 20 million households sharing Hulu. Finally, the analyst also updated his outlook due to updated expectations from Disney CEO Bob Iger. These include anticipation that free cash flow should exceed $8 billion in 2024, and the operating income for domestic and international parks could grow in the low- to mid-teens in the second quarter of this year. — Lisa Kailai Han 7:34 a.m.: Buy Domino's stock as key sales metric looks attractive, Evercore ISI says Domino's Pizza could see strong gains as same-store sales improve, according to Evercore ISI. Analyst David Palmer added $50 to his price target, now expecting shares to climb 13.5% to $560. Palmer has an outperform rating on the Michigan-based pizza chain. ""We are encouraged that SSS accelerated in March driven by transaction growth from its revamped loyalty program and start to targeted national marketing on Uber Eats,"" Palmer said, using the acronym for same-store sales. ""We believe the company's SSS strength will increasingly prove a standout compared to that of fast food industry peers."" Palmer raised his expectation for full-year growth in same-store sales to 5% from 4%, exceeding the average analyst's outlook. He now anticipates earnings per share will come in at $15.86 for the year, which would be above Wall Street consensus and mark an annualized gain of about 8%. He acknowledged that his target is at a premium from a price-to-earnings multiple perspective. But the multiple could actually expand further relative to the S & P 500, the analyst said, given the potential for multiyear growth in same-store sales. Domino's stock has jumped nearly 20% in 2024. — Alex Harring 7:19 a.m.: Boeing stock is in 'purgatory', Bernstein says Boeing shares are currently in ""purgatory"" following the midair panel blowout earlier this year, Bernstein said. Analyst Douglas Harned cut down his price target by $32 to $240, which still reflects potential upside of about 31%. He also has an outperform rating on the aerospace stock. ""Since the January 5th MAX-9 accident with Alaska flight 1282, we see Boeing's stock as essentially in a purgatory situation [until] three issues are resolved,"" Harned wrote to clients. The first of the three issues is the CEO choice after Dave Calhoun steps down at the end of 2024. Harned noted there appears to be a small pool of candidates, though timing on the decision is unclear. Next is the 737 Max delivery recovery. Harned said he needs to see more signs of improvement on this to have confidence in a long-term ramp. Stability of market share is the last of the three, according to the analyst. He said it has become increasingly likely that airlines may opt to work with other plane makers amid Boeing's reputational crisis. In addition to cutting his price target, Harned also pulled down his outlook for free cash flow and deliveries. Still, he said there's reason to remain positive on the stock looking longer term. ""Long-term, Boeing will remain part of a successful duopoly,"" he said. ""But, the path there is more uncertain and the end result could now place the company in a weaker position."" Boeing shares slipped about 1% before the bell on Monday. The stock has tumbled nearly 30% this year, making it the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. — Alex Harring 7:04 a.m.: Buy Ulta following worst week since 2020, Loop Capital recommends Investors should snap up Ulta Beauty after last week's sell-off, Loop Capital advised. Analyst Anthony Chukumba upgraded the beauty retailer to buy from hold on the heels of last week's drop of nearly 15%, its biggest since 2020. Chukumba's $540 price target implies an upside of 21.4% from where the stock finished Friday. Chukumba said comparable sales data should improve over the remainder of the year, which can provide financial tailwinds to the stock. Solid capital allocation and the potential for a cash dividend in the near future also offer reasons for optimism, he said. ""We believe last week's selloff was well overdone, particularly given the extremely difficult comparison Ulta Beauty is facing in F1Q 2024,"" he said. ""We expect the company's performance to improve over the final three quarters of F2024, primarily driven by easing YoY comparisons as well as new product introductions."" Shares rose 1.5% in Monday premarket trading. But after last week's slide, shares are down more than 9% on the year. — Alex Harring 6:58 a.m.: Deutsche Bank reinstates Broadcom with buy rating Deutsche Bank restarted its coverage of Broadcom , seeing room to run for the artificial intelligence-connected semiconductor stock. Analyst Ross Seymore reinstated his buy rating on the stock. His new price target of $1,500 implies an upside of around 12%. ""As we resume coverage, we continue to see three positive drivers to AVGO shares,"" Seymore said. Here are the big three: AI, with the company set to see around $12.5 billion in revenue tied to the technology in the 2025 fiscal year, up from $10 billion the prior year. The accretion potential connected to the company's acquisition of VMWare. The likelihood of a rebound in de-risked segments that are cyclically levered, a group that includes broadband and server storage connectivity. Seymore's call comes amid a strong period, with shares jumping 20% in 2024 after almost doubling in the prior year. AVGO YTD mountain AVGO year to date — Alex Harring 6:56 a.m.: Analysts raise expectations for Netflix shares ahead of earnings The price target hikes have started rolling in for Netflix ahead of the streaming titan's quarterly earnings report later this month. The big technology company posts its latest financials on Thursday, April 18. Ahead of that, JPMorgan and TD Cowen told clients they were raising their respective estimates for where shares will go over the next year on Monday. JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth increased his target by $40 to $650, reflecting a 2.2% upside from where Netflix finished last week. Anmuth said there's more opportunity for Netflix, which he has an overweight rating on, to continue monetizing following the password sharing crackdown. ""While the lowest hanging fruit was captured in 2023, we believe Netflix still has meaningful Paid Sharing monetization opportunity as it tightens filters across specific use cases & borrower cohorts,"" he said. TD Cowen analyst John Blackledge hiked his target by $125 to $725, now implying a 14% ascent on the horizon. In addition to paid sharing, Blackledge also said the company's strong media was a core reason for his buy rating. ""Netflix is benefiting from a dual tailwind of paid sharing initiatives as well as strong underlying biz demand from a robust, increasingly global content slate,"" he said. These calls come amid an already good year for the California-based company, with shares climbing more than 30%. — Alex Harring 6:21 a.m.: Take-Two can rally more than 30%, Citi says Citi sees Take-Two's risk-reward ratio as too good to pass up. Analyst Jason Bazinet upgraded the video game maker's shares to buy from neutral and hiked his price target by $30 to $200. Bazinet's new target shows the potential for the stock to rally 32.4% over the next year. ""Given the 4:1 risk-reward, we view the equity as compelling at prevailing levels,"" he wrote to clients. The new target reflects a a weighting of approximately 67% to the firm's bull case, with the rest allocated to the bear outlook, Bazinet said. Bazinet said the timing of Grand Theft Auto VI's release and volume of bookings are both unknowns weighing on the stock. Trends within the mobile gaming portfolio is another reason for pause, he added. On the release timing front, he said there's a downside of approximately $7 for every six months of delays. He called timing a ""very real but manageable risk."" But there isn't much risk when it comes to how it will perform, he said. The analyst forecasted between $2.6 billion and $2.9 billion in bookings from the product. There's also signs that the mobile portfolio, which has been historically weak, is stabilizing, according to Bazinet. Take-Two shares jumped more than 2% before the bell on Monday. But shares have struggled in 2024 with a slide of more than 6%. — Alex Harring 6:05 a.m.: Goldman: Buy BJ's Wholesale on earnings upside potential There are several earnings-related reasons to be optimistic on BJ's Wholesale Club , according to Goldman Sachs. Analyst Kate McShane upgraded shares to buy from neutral and raised her price target by $6 to $87. McShane's new target implies a 14.9% gain from where the wholesaler finished Friday. ""We see earnings upside driven by a better top-line outlook with the return of volume growth in grocery and solid inflation support,"" McShane wrote to clients Monday. That's ""along with greater customer engagement likely in general merchandise categories amid an improving consumer backdrop and the company's assortment refresh."" In short, volume growth can help the grocery business, while positive general merchandise trends can drive up sales. Trends for the quarter so far also appear beneficial, she said. The Massachusetts-based company's stock can also see upside through an increase to membership fees, McShane said. ""Ultimately, BJ is an attractive club model with a compelling value proposition and long runway for new club growth that should continue to gain market share over the long term,"" she wrote. Shares popped nearly 2% in Monday premarket trading. The stock has advanced nearly 14% in 2024. BJ YTD mountain BJ in 2024 — Alex Harring 5:53 a.m.: Buy GE Vernova's dip, JPMorgan says JPMorgan said a slide in shares of newly public GE Vernova provides a good spot to buy in. Analyst Mark Strouse upgraded the energy stock, which began trading last week , to overweight from neutral. Strouse's $141 price target implies shares can climb 14.9% from last week's close. ""We believe the pullback presents an attractive entry point for what we believe will be a core holding for investors in the US/global electrification theme,"" Strouse wrote in a note to clients. Strouse said the stock can be a core long-term holding for investors wanting exposure to electrification. He also said the company can see upside to forecasts as data centers require more energy. Looking ahead, he said the new few earnings reports can provide evidence into a continued margin rebound. Despite its rough start to trading, GE Vernova shares climbed nearly 2% before the bell on Monday. — Alex Harring 5:48 a.m.: Morgan Stanley sees more upside for Ford stock following EV strategy shift Ford's reassessment of its electric vehicle strategy is largely good for the automaker's financials, according to Morgan Stanley. Analyst Adam Jonas upped his price target on the automaker by $1 to $17, implying 28% upside over Friday's close. He has an overweight rating on Ford and called it a top pick. ""Following Ford's announcement of a significant recalibration (slower/later) of their EV strategy we make a number of changes to our Ford earnings model that are largely positive and drive a slight increase in our price target,"" he wrote in a Friday note to clients. Unit volume for the electric Model e cars was cut by a combined 27% compared with prior Morgan Stanley estimates for 2024 and 2024. Now, Jonas anticipates battery electric vehicles should make up less than 7% of total Ford unit volume by 2030, far lower than the prior forecast of 14%. Ford should see adjusted loss before interest and taxes for the Model e at $4.6 billion and $3.6 billion in the fiscal 2024 and 2025 years, respectively. That's a decrease from prior guidance showing losses of between $5 billion and $5.5 billion in 2024 and $4.4 billion in 2025. Jonas also cut his capital expenditure outlook for the two years. He now expects $7.7 billion in 2024 and $8.6 billion in 2025, down from prior estimates of $8 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively. Ford management has said the company still believes in electric vehicles, but doesn't see widespread adoption happening until costs come closer in line with traditional cars. Shares have climbed nearly 9% in 2024. — Alex Harring 5:48 a.m.: KeyBanc raises Nvidia price target There's no slowing down Nvidia , according to KeyBanc. Analyst John Vinh raised his price target on the stock to $1,200 per share from $1,100, implying upside of 36% from Friday's close. He also reiterated his overweight rating. Vinh noted ""supply chain feedback indicates GB200 with [average selling prices] of $1.5M-$2M are expected to become a mainstream configuration in 2025 and could generate as much as $90B-$140B in revenues in of itself."" He added: ""Demand for H20 in China is much higher than anticipated and could contribute $9B-$12B in incremental revenues this year."" Shares have been on a tear this year, surging more than 77%.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average popped 2% for its biggest weekly gain of 2024. That gain drove the 30-stock benchmark to an all-time high, putting it within striking distance of 40,000. The S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite popped 2.3% and 2.9%, respectively, to record levels. These latest gains came after the Federal Reserve indicated it remained on track to cut interest rates three times this year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell also noted that a strong labor market wouldn't deter the central bank from cutting rates. The question for investors now is: How do you navigate a market that's trading at record levels, with the bulk of the gains coming from artificial intelligence stocks? .DJI 5D mountain Dow this week Earlier this week, CNBC Pro spoke to an investor who caught the big rallies in Nvidia and Microsoft. Blair Boyer, co-head of large cap growth equity at Jennison, said he likes Advanced Micro Devices, Meta Platforms and Visa going forward — among others .

""The self-reinforcing nature of these characteristics is such that it tends to mean that companies have the ability to use the free cash flow that they generate to reinvest in their business,"" Boyer said. Analysts also reiterated their bullish views on Nvidia this week, with Goldman Sachs raising its price target on the high-flying AI play to $1,000. The company unveiled its Blackwell graphics processing units on Monday. JPMorgan noted the announcement solidifies Nvidia's position in the AI space. ""With leading silicon (GPU/DPU/CPU), hardware/software platforms, and a strong ecosystem, NVIDIA is well positioned to continue to benefit from major secular trends in AI, high-performance computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles, in our view,"" JPMorgan wrote .

The S & P 500 faltered this week, pulling back after notching its best first quarter since 2019. That has left investors asking if the market could be in for some consolidation after megacap stocks pushed the broad index higher in the five months since the end of October.

274,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/03/jim-cramer-sees-ford-and-costco-nearing-buy-levels-heres-the-story-behind-each.html,GM,General Motors,Jim Cramer sees Ford and Costco nearing buy levels. Here's the story behind each,"Ford and Costco are approaching good levels to pick up additional shares, according to Jim Cramer. Both companies depend on how Americans are feeling about the economy, which reached its highest reading since July 2021, according to the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey for March. ""Costco shares have given back some recent gains but business is strong,"" said Jeff Marks, the Club's director of portfolio analysis. ""Ford's stock has been slowly moving up on improving business fundamentals."" Ford fundamentals Shares of Club name Ford rose 2.8% to $13.65 each Wednesday after vehicle sales in the first quarter grew 6.8%. The automaker's pivot to high-margin hybrid vehicles continued to pay off. Hybrid sales were up 42% in Q1, which was the best figure in more than two decades. Electric vehicle sales were up 86% despite some industry signs of dampening EV demand. ""These numbers do not show the profitability of Ford,"" Jim said Wednesday, suggesting investors should value the company at higher levels. Ford shares need to catch up to crosstown rival General Motors , he argued. Shares of GM were up 25.8% year to date, compared with Ford's 11.98% gain. ""I want to run with it,"" he added on Ford stock. F 1Y mountain F stock's 1-year performance. Usually, we think of buying stocks when they are going down. But in the case of an embattled stock like Ford, it's sometimes better to see whether a nascent recovery like Ford shares have enjoyed this year will take hold against business improvements. Our Club price target on Ford is $15 per share. In the meantime, we're holding Ford because it's making some of the most in-demand hybrids. Ford's hybrids, which include a sought-after F-150 pickup version, carry higher margins that have been helping offset losses in the company's Model e business, which houses its fleet of electric vehicles. Another incentive to own the stock has been its annual dividend yield — currently around 4.4%. Costco opportunity Club holding Costco caught some heat Wednesday, falling 0.8% in the session, after it was downgraded by Gordon Haskett along with three other retailers: Five Below , Dollar Tree and Lowe's . The analysts cut their Costco rating to accumulate from buy but held their price target at $775 per share. Gordon Haskett was ""waving a yellow flag"" after Costco's more-than-40% rally over the past 12 months. While still optimistic about 2024 given the positive macro backdrop of low unemployment, real wage growth, and moderating inflation, the analysts cite a ""notable wall-of-worry"" on recent gas price increases, election risk, and fewer shopping holidays. That call didn't change our bullish long-term view on Costco. ""I'm not going to back away. Costco is really great,"" Jim said, while suggesting that pullbacks present a buying opportunity. ""Costco's chart is really bad and yet as I said [Tuesday] if this thing goes under $700, I want people to start accumulating it."" Costco shares are up nearly 7% year to date. The stock has pulled back about 10% after closing at an all-time high of $785.59 on March 7. The reason: second quarter results for fiscal 2024 that didn't clear the very high bar set by Wall Street. As we said at the time, a slight miss on sales and margins was not a thesis-changing event. In fact, we raised our price target to the current $800 per share from $770 after the report. COST 1Y mountain COST stock's 1-year performance. The fact the membership-only retailer has a new CEO and CFO after veteran executives Craig Jelinek and Rich Galanti retired is certainly a wrinkle to the Costco story. But given our view that Costco has a strong company culture and the new CEO, Ron Vachris, was promoted from within, we don't see the departures impacting operations or execution. Kroger's former finance chief, Gary Millerchip, took over the same job at Costco in mid-March. Costco has drifted lower in recent weeks even with a key catalyst on the horizon. An earlier catalyst that we'd been waiting to see, a special cash dividend, was finally declared in December and totaled $15 a share. The looming spark for the stock is a membership fee increase, which typically occurs every five years or so. It's a matter of ""when, not if"" management will decide to raise fees. When this happens, some of that additional fee income could flow directly to profits. But a majority of the extra cash would likely be reinvested back into the business to keep product prices down, which drives store traffic and market share.

275,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/26/ford-falls-amazon-advances-pharmacy-pursuits-and-disney-board-member-speaks-our-takes-the-news.html,GM,General Motors,"Ford falls, Amazon advances pharmacy pursuits and Disney board member speaks – our takes the news","Ford Motor kept its 2024 guidance unchanged Tuesday. Meanwhile, Amazon 's pharmacy efforts added another wrinkle and Disney 's newest board member weighed in on the proxy fight underway at the entertainment giant. Here's a closer look at these headlines and our takes on each. F YTD mountain F stock performance year-to-date. The news: Ford CFO John Lawler on Tuesday reiterated the company's 2024 operating guidance at the Bank of America Securities Auto Summit. Ford still expects to earn between $10 billion and $12 billion in adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT; generate adjusted free cash flow between $6 billion and $7 billion; and spend between $8 billion and $9.5 billion on capital expenditures — just as the company offered in early February alongside its 2023 fourth quarter results earlier this month. Club take: Shares of Ford were hit hard Tuesday, falling 3.6%, even though rival General Motors advanced 1% in the session. The divergence in stock performance was not great to see. At the time Ford first issued its guidance, we perceived it as upbeat. The fact it was reiterated Tuesday suggests management's efforts to cut about $2 billion in costs are on track, and its scaled-back EV investments and intensified focused on hybrids are going as planned. Indeed, Ford's February sales figures showed plenty of momentum in the hybrid market. Ford got back on track with its February earnings report, but going forward we still need to see consistency in profits, cash flows and quality control, while managing losses in its electric vehicle division. Following Ford's fourth-quarter earnings print, we raised our price target on Ford shares to $15 from $13. ""It's time for Ford to break out,"" Jim Cramer said in Monday's Homestretch. Investors are set to get another update on Ford's business strength April 24, when the automaker reports its 2024 first quarter numbers after the close. AMZN YTD mountain AMZN stock performance year-to-date. The news: Amazon on Tuesday launched same-day delivery of prescription medication for customers in New York City and the greater Los Angeles area. The service — offered through Amazon Pharmacy launched in 2020 — is part of the company's efforts to provide ""the fastest and most convenient service for the home delivery of prescriptions,"" said Doug Herrington, CEO of Worldwide Amazon Stores, in a press release. Medications for flu, diabetes and other common conditions are available through the service, Amazon said. To help offer the swift delivery, Amazon said it is leveraging artificial intelligence ""to help pharmacists fill prescriptions quickly and accurately."" The e-commerce giant plans to expand same-day medicine delivery to more than a dozen cities by year-end. The service has been available to customers in Seattle, Miami, Indianapolis, Phoenix and Austin, Texas. Club take: Amazon's expansion of same-day delivery of prescription medication is another sign of the company's focus on innovating in health care. And we're always encouraged by efforts to boost the value of a Prime subscription. Financially, Tuesday's announcement is not really a needle mover. Nevertheless, the ability to offer same-day delivery for prescriptions spotlights Amazon's logistics and delivery prowess. For its traditional e-commerce business, the company has wisely streamlined its fulfilment network to reduce delivery times and overall cost of delivery, helping it make more money. In general, we feel good about our Amazon position, particularly in light of its relationship with Nvidia on AI, as Jim detailed in his Sunday column . DIS YTD mountain DIS stock performance year-to-date. The news: The newest member of Disney's board, Morgan Stanley Executive Chairman James Gorman, offered his perspective on the entertainment company's proxy fight in an interview with CNBC. ""A lot of this fight seems to be looking backwards. I'm more interested and why I joined the board in looking forwards,"" Gorman said. His comments come ahead of Disney's annual meeting, set for April 3, where Trian Partner's Nelson Peltz is seeking a board seat along with former Disney CFO Jay Rasulo. When pressed with Disney's stock underperformance against the broader market and its competitors in recent years, Gorman's justification was the ""period of major disruption in this industry"" from linear to streaming while navigating through the challenging post-pandemic environment. With CEO Bog Iger back at the helm, the company is ""turning that around. Its evidenced by the performance in the stock,"" Gorman explained. Shares of Disney are up nearly 33% year to date, but the stock has dramatically underperformed the S & P 500 over a five-year period. In that time frame, its cumulative total return is 9.7% compared with 100.2% for the S & P 500, according to FactSet. Club take: We've been supporting Peltz in his push to have two seats on Disney's board. We believe Peltz will be critical in creating shareholder value and reviving losses in Disney's underperforming businesses given his governance experience at consumer companies over the years such as Procter & Gamble , Wendy's , Heinz , and Unilever . In our minds, the pressure Peltz has been putting on Disney through this proxy battle has already helped motivate management and contributed to the stock's strong performance lately. Shares of Disney made a new 52-week high Tuesday and closed at just under $120 apiece. As discussed on Monday's Morning Meeting, we would consider trimming our position if we weren't restricted, given the stock's year-to-date gains. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long F, AMZN, DIS.

Ford Motor reported a 6.8% rise in first-quarter U.S. auto sales on Wednesday, powered by demand for its pickup trucks, crossover SUVs and hybrids.

Sales of the automaker's affordable compact Maverick pickup truck surged nearly 82% to 39,061 units as more buyers gravitated toward cheaper vehicles over the past few months amid higher living costs.

Ford had also boosted production capacity for the Maverick, which starts at $23,815, late last year to meet the strong demand.",4/3/2024,0,0.00187419,0.991362274,0.000828472,0.003491224,0.001657483,0.000786351

Please refresh every 20-30 minutes to view the latest posts.) Major tech-related companies were front and center on analysts' minds Friday. Analysts around Wall Street reacted to results from Amazon, Meta Platforms and Apple. On Amazon, a Goldman Sachs analyst said the company is positioned ""as a leader in all aspects of secular growth within our Internet coverage."" Elsewhere, Bank of America raised its price target on Nvidia, calling for more than 25% upside. Check out the latest calls and chatter below. All times ET. 8:25 a.m.: Evercore ISI upgrades Global Payments to outperform Global Payments' earnings report later this month could be the start of a big year for the stock, according to Evercore ISI. Analyst David Togut upgraded the payments to stock to outperform from in line, saying in a note to clients that the company should deliver a positive surprise to the market when it reports its fourth quarter results on Feb. 14. ""We envision meaningful upward revisions to CY24 & CY25 adjusted EPS consensus estimates plus forward multiple expansion stemming from declining capital intensity and improved FCF conversion,"" the note said. The company's merchant solutions business should perform better than rival Visa, Togut said. Visa said in its latest quarterly report last week that it expects net revenue growth in the low double digits for its current fiscal year. ""GPN's volume growth should continue to perform well relative to Visa's total US payment volume gains as domestic air-travel growth continues to slow, a vertical that GPN is underweight,"" the note said. Evercore hiked its price target on Global Payments to $185 per share from $129. The new target is more than 36% above where shares closed on Friday. — Jesse Pound 8:02 a.m.: Citi keeps bullish rating on Disney as earnings near Citi is optimistic ahead of Disney earnings. Analyst Jason Bazinet reaffirmed his buy rating and $106 price target going into the entertainment giant's report next week. His price target reflects a 9.2% upside over Thursday's closing level. ""We believe the primary focus will be on DTC profitability and the execution of company's cost saving initiatives announced in F1Q23,"" Bazinet wrote to clients. Bazinet said he'll be listening for information or updates on five key topics: ESPN's direct-to-consumer strategy Cost-saving initiatives Hulu control Goals in India Plans of new CFO Hugh Johnston Disney has added 7.5% in the new year, outperforming the broader market's gain of almost 3%. But that comes after a year of underperformance, with the stock finishing 2023 up just under 4% while the S & P 500 jumped more than 24%. — Alex Harring 7:58 a.m.: Bernstein takes a breather on Vertex Pharmaceuticals Vertex Pharmaceuticals doesn't appear to have much more upside potential this year, according to Bernstein. The firm stepped to the sideline on shares, lowering its rating to market perform from outperform. It reiterated its $450 price target, implying just 4% upside potential from Thursday's close. Shares have rallied more than 40% over the last 12 months. Analyst William Pickering cited ""a thinning catalyst calendar and current valuation that does not leave significant upside to our price target."" ""Vertex reports next Monday, and we also see some risk that expense guidance disappoints like last year,"" he said in a Friday note. Pickering is leaning negative on the company's risk-reward outlook, and does not have high conviction on the company's cystic fibrosis treatment, which recently completed Phase 3 studies. — Hakyung Kim 7:48 a.m.: Deckers earnings make analysts even more bullish Analysts see more room to run for Deckers after a better-than-expected earnings report. The shoemaker earned $15.11 per share and revenue of $1.56 billion. Both topped Wall Street expectations, with the consensus forecasts of analysts polled by LSEG at $11.48 for earnings per share and $1.45 billion in revenue. Bank of America analyst Christopher Nardone reiterated his buy rating following the release, noting the company is ""hurdling over another high bar."" Nardone raised his price target by $135 to $875, now implying shares can rise 13.2% over Thursday's ending price. ""We ... expect innovation and newness will continue to drive share gains at HOKA and UGG,"" Nardone said, referencing two of the company's popular brands. (Hoka is known for running shoes, while Ugg is synonymous with its winter boot line.) UBS analyst Jay Sole is even more optimistic. He hiked his price target by $200 to $1,150, which now means he believes shares can rally 48.8% from Thursday's close. ""We anticipate sentiment stays bullish around the stock as the company shows it can maintain a high EPS growth rate,"" Sole told clients, while also noting excitement around Hoka and Ugg. Deckers has already soared more than 15% in 2024. It has advanced every year since 2015. — Alex Harring 7:32 a.m.: UBS stays bullish on Chipotle with earnings on horizon Chipotle has traffic momentum and a growth rate that deserves a premium, according to UBS. Analyst Dennis Geiger reiterated his buy rating on the stock heading into its earnings report next week. Geiger's price target implies the stock can add 10.6%. Geiger said to expect traffic momentum in the fourth quarter and a continuation of positive numbers on the measure throughout 2024. He also said there's potential upside to fourth-quarter margins. ""We continue to view CMG as one of the best positioned in the sector for traffic outperformance and margin gains into 2024, and we value the brand's highly dependable growth outlook,"" Geiger told clients. In addition to margin opportunities, he said accelerating unit growth can also help push the share price up. Chipotle has advanced nearly 7% in the new year, building on 2023's rally of nearly 65%. — Alex Harring 7:18 a.m.: Costco has more upside ahead after blowing past prior expectation for share price: Oppenheimer Oppenheimer expects Costco shares to take another leg up. With the wholesaler now trading above analyst Rupesh Parikh's previous $695 price target, he now expects the stock to reach $760, or 7.9% above Thursday's close. Parikh also reiterated his outperform rating. ""We believe fundamental momentum is poised to accelerate from here,"" Parikh wrote to clients on Friday. That due to ""COST's demonstrated ability to drive grocery share even in low inflationary/deflationary backdrops, an improving outlook for its non-foods offering on easier comparisons and moderating inflation, and a potentially strengthening middle to higher income consumer."" While Parikh expects a membership fee hike in the coming quarters, he said it may no longer be a positive catalyst given recent gains. Costco deserves its high valuation, the analyst said. The stock has added nearly 7% so far this year, extending gains after climbing more than 44% in 2023. ""COST shares now trade at peakish valuations,"" he said. ""We believe COST's superior global unit growth prospects, track record of driving share gains, and competitive moat should help to sustain a premium valuation."" — Alex Harring 7:07 a.m.: Deutsche Bank deals latest blow to regional bank after earnings disappoint Deutsche Bank joined the post-earnings dogpile on New York Community Bank . Analyst Bernard von-Gizycki downgraded the regional bank to hold from buy and slashed to price target to $7 from $15. Still, Von-Gizycki's new target implies shares can advance 21.7% from Thursday's close. It has been a tough period for the company since reporting earnings Wednesday, with von-Gizycki noting that shares have tumbled about 45% since. Investors were nervous after the bank posted a fourth-quarter loss, announced a provision for credit losses and cut the dividend. ""It's a tough call given the sharp sell-off and low valuation but also a lot of uncertainty surrounding credit quality and net interest income and resulting earnings,"" von-Gizycki wrote in a Friday note to clients. The analyst said his hold rating reflects three key factors: Lower earnings power after the report will will ""significantly diminish"" the near-term outlook for the net interest margin. There's uncertainty over timing and costs to implement certain requirements for the business. The credit outlook ""remains uncertain post large reserve events,"" despite historical management being strong. Despite the downgrade, shares of the bank added 2.1% before the bell on Friday. Still, the stock has lost nearly 44% compared with the start of 2024. Traders may know New York Community Bank for its subsidiary Flagstar, which acquired assets from shuttered Signature Bank amid the banking crisis last year. — Alex Harring 6:42 a.m.: This internet stock can rally more than 20% as e-commerce platform reaches 'inflection point,' Citi says There's an opportunity to snap up Sea shares as one of its brands nears a turning point, according to Citi. Analyst Alicia Yap upgraded the consumer internet stock to buy from neutral and raised her price target by $6 to $50. Yap's new target now implies shares can climb 23.5% over the next year. A key part of this thesis is tied to the ability of Shopee, Sea's e-commerce platform, to remain a leader while narrowing losses, she said. ""We could see an inflection point in coming months if Shopee successfully maintains its leading position via diligent spending while delivering a gradually improving monetization rate with narrowing EBITDA loss,"" she told clients. ""Shopee could prove its execution, positioning it to achieve sustainable growth profitably. Together with steady gaming bookings on stable EBITDA margins while Fintech business delivers an improving profitability trend, Sea's fundamental outlook is likely to turn more promising."" Shares advanced 2.1% before the bell following the upgrade. Yap's target implies the a change of course for the stock: Shares are near flat for 2024, but they lost more than 76% and 22% in 2022 and 2023, respectively. SE YTD mountain SE shares year to date — Alex Harring 6:30 a.m.: Analysts diverge on where Apple will go next following earnings Apple bucked the big tech trend, with analysts less upbeat and having less consensus on what's next following the technology giant's earnings report. Despite beating expectations on both lines for the fiscal first quarter, shares fell nearly 3% in Friday's premarket as investors keyed in on troubles in China and a weak outlook for iPhone sales. Apple CEO Tim Cook also signaled that the company could have an artificial intelligence-related announcement later this year. Analysts' expectations on the stock vary widely. Here's what a handful wrote to clients in response to the print: KeyBanc analyst Brandon Nispel kept his sector weight rating and has no price target: ""F2Q24 guidance likely came in below expectations, and we believe expectations need to move lower, yet again. With investors focused on U.S. upgrade rates and China competition, both the Americas segment and China segment came in below expectations, and we do not believe the dynamics are likely to change in the near term. This, paired with AAPL's still premium valuation and limited growth, suggests that AAPL is likely to be range-bound and perform in line with the Nasdaq at best."" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring remained overweight with a $220 price target, implying shares can rise 17.7% from Thursday's close: ""In our view, bears will continue to argue that fundamentals do not support Apple's current valuation. But sentiment is already negatively skewed, and without a catalyst for derating ... we're not sure what 'breaks' the story. Instead, we see tonight's guide down as a clearing event (as we previewed). Meaning, Apple has now gotten its 'guide down' out of the way, and investors can now look to the June Worldwide Developer Conference, where we expect Apple to introduce its first Gen AI-enabled software upgrade, and the September iPhone 16 launch, as upside catalysts to help reaccelerate growth in FY25."" Barclays analyst Tim Long is still underweight and shaved $2 off his price target to $158, meaning he believes shares can slide 15.4%: ""AAPL has been in a historically bad run, with y/y revenue declines in all four quarters of FY23, and 1HFY24 looking down y/y as well. We see nothing in the pipeline to help improve the numbers, which over time should pressure the multiple. ... Near term, we expect heightened macro uncertainty and demand weakness to remain an overhang. We think the elevated P/E multiple is harder to justify given limited estimates upgrade potential."" Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar stayed neutral but cut his price target by $15 to $190, now implying the stock can climb just 1.7% from Thursday's close: ""Apple reported what we thought was an exceptionally clean and well run December quarter. However, given the tough Y/Y comparison, things look to us more challenging for the upcoming March quarter. We still believe that fundamentals remain strong as the brand continues to grow with the launch of the Vision Pro."" — Alex Harring 5:57 a.m.: Analysts see big gains ahead for Meta following earnings report Meta appears have to given investors a buffet of reasons to buy into the stock. There's the better-than-expected quarterly financial results, the tripling of profit, the first-ever dividend, the expectation of muted hiring for the longer term and the focus on artificial intelligence. Shares soared more than 16% before the bell on Friday. Here's what got analysts particularly excited and catalyzed many to make significant increases to target prices: Barclays analyst Ross Sandler reiterated his overweight while raising his price target by $150 to $550, now implying an upside of 39.3% from Thursday's close: ""The META story continues to shine relative to mega cap tech, and we think the winning streak can continue for the foreseeable future, attracting more long-term investors (yes, we still think META is under-owned vs. peers)."" Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black kept his buy rating while increasing his target to $525 from $450, which now reflects a 33% upside over Thursday's closing level: ""Looking back just one year, we believe the company has clearly demonstrated strong execution, decisive cost discipline, and in our view has significantly built credibility in its ability to successfully navigate a challenging environment and has now positioned the company for durable growth."" Stifel analyst Mark Kelley has a buy rating and raised his price target to $527 from $405, now showing a 33.5% upside: ""The company is firing on all cylinders and continues to hammer home the notion that this will be a more efficient and leaner organization going forward, despite the heavy AI investment cycle that is well underway. Commentary across Reels, Advantage+, and Shopping were positive, and we expect the next wave of advertiser-focused AI tools to keep this momentum going. The icing on the cake is the dividend that will bring in a new class of investors, and should enable another re-rating for shares."" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik, who has an outperform rating and upped his target by $100 to $535, which now reflects a 35.5% upside: "" Revenue growth and guidance likely put to rest the biggest hangup of owning Meta into decelerating growth, but we were more impressed with the long-term vision laid out. Skeptics like to question 'who still uses Facebook?', but the Facebook app continues to grow users across all regions adapting to changing consumer tastes and needs, Meta's family of apps continues to expand (Threads, Quest), while newer AI initiatives show the promise of a durable future. Perhaps just like the famed Patek slogan, 'you never actually own Meta's stock, you merely look after it for the next generation'."" — Alex Harring 5:45 a.m.: Wall Street sees a lot to like in Amazon's earnings report Amazon surpassed earnings expectations for the fourth quarter, sending shares up more than 6% before the bell Friday and garnering praise from Wall Street analysts. The e-commerce giant earned $1 per share on revenue of $170 billion in the quarter, while analysts polled by LSEG anticipated 80 cents and $166.2 billion. Amazon also announced Rufus , a shopping assistant that utilizes artificial intelligence. Many analysts showed bullish sentiment following the reports through increased price targets. Here's what some told clients: Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan, who reiterated his buy rating and raised his price target by $20 to $220, now implying upside of 38.1%: ""We continue to see Amazon positioned as a leader in all aspects of secular growth within our Internet coverage. ... In total, every key metric that Amazon is measured against exceeded expectations and we come away from this earnings report with an increased confidence interval in our medium/long term thesis of Amazon's key platform drivers."" Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik, who kept his outperform rating and hiked his target price $25 to $200, 25.6% above Thursday's closing level: ""After stressing over what the Amazon results would be post Google sell-off, we read the earnings press release with gusto. Every number we checked looked good."" Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak, still overweight with a raised price target by $15 to $200, once again implying a 25.6% upside: "" AMZN's results and guide speak to how improving execution, cost discipline, and an AWS recovery are leading to outsized EBIT and free cash flow revisions."" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson, who still has an outperform rating and raised his target for shares by $35 to $215, reflecting a 35% upside: ""Better-than-feared AWS growth and meaningful EBIT upside put AMZN on the doorstep of unlocking tens of billions of free cash flow over the next few years which bulls have been waiting for. Most encouraging to us is that in spite of strong numbers where Street EBIT estimates should move solidly higher, several of the most important, incremental drivers have really only just begun."" — Alex Harring 5:45 a.m.: Bank of America hikes Nvidia price target Don't expect Nvidia to lose momentum anytime soon, according to Bank of America. BofA analyst Vivek Arya raised his price target on Nvidia to $800 from $700 per share, while reiterating his buy rating on the stock and calling for a strong fourth quarter report later this month. The new target implies upside of nearly 27%. ""Early days, but results from top US cloud customers suggest solid motivation for spending in genAI,"" the analyst wrote.

Credit card debt has notched another new high. Americans now owe $1.13 trillion on their credit cards, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported Tuesday. Balances jumped 10% from a year ago, according to a separate quarterly credit industry insights report from TransUnion, with the average balance per consumer hitting $6,360, also a historic record.

'It's not all bad news'

""It's not all bad news,"" said Ted Rossman, Bankrate's senior industry analyst. Cardholders who pay their bill in full every month reap the benefits of cash back and travel rewards without paying interest. ""The big fork in the road is whether or not you carry a balance,"" he said. In that case, credit cards are one of the most expensive ways to borrow money. The average credit card charges a record high 20.74%, according to Bankrate. At more than 20%, if you made minimum payments toward the average credit card balance, it would take you more than 17 years to pay off the debt and cost you more than $9,000 in interest, Rossman calculated.

Millennials increasingly lean on credit

Still, consumers often turn to credit cards, in part because they are more accessible than other types of loans. Overall, an additional 20.1 million new credit accounts were opened in the fourth quarter of 2023, boosted in part by subprime borrowers looking for additional liquidity, according to Wise. Subprime generally refers to those with a credit score of 600 or below, according to TransUnion. Many people in this group are millennials, he said, who are burdened by high levels of student loan debt and the housing affordability crisis. ""If you can't afford to buy and your rent keeps going up, that's not a very happy set of circumstances,"" Wise said.

More bank failures could be looming

NYCB's woes come about one year after Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank collapsed, followed by First Republic in May. More bank failures are likely looming amid recession risks, uncertain interest rate forecasts and weakness in the commercial real estate market, Bair warned in a recent editorial in The Washington Post that she co-authored with Charles Goodhart, emeritus professor at the London School of Economics. Recent bank failures were largely caused by bank mismanagement. Yet legislation to increase accountability for those leaders has stalled on Capitol Hill, they wrote.

Consumers can take comfort in the fact that banking regulators have been working overtime since last year to review the banks and ensure they are carefully monitored, particularly if they have concentrations of risky loans or other types of activities that may cause stress, said Dennis Kelleher, president and CEO of Better Markets, a non-profit organization focused on building a more secure financial system. ""If you're a depositor, 99% of depositors have no worries, because deposits up to $250,000 are fully insured by the FDIC,"" Kelleher said.

How to check your deposit coverage

It's important for consumers to make sure they are below the uninsured deposit limits, Bair said. To help with that, FDIC provides a tool on its website to help consumers test their coverage. In the event of a failure, consumers who are below the insured deposit limits can generally expect continued access to their deposits, according to Bair. ""The FDIC has a perfect track record of protecting those deposits,"" Bair said. ""When a bank fails, in almost all situations, they provide immediate seamless access, there's no disruption at all in the access to the bank account.""",3/7/2024,0,0.190863773,0.019960292,0.00146244,0.06511385,0.720700324,0.001899266

A woman who had accused Apollo Global Management co-founder Leon Black of raping her at the New York mansion of the late sex predator Jeffrey Epstein has agreed to drop her civil lawsuit against Black.

The suit by the woman, Cheri Pierson, was ""discontinued with prejudice and without costs to any party as against the other,"" according to a Manhattan Supreme Court filing Friday signed by her lawyer and Black's attorney.

That notation means that Pierson cannot resurrect her legal claims against the billionaire investor Black in connection with the purported attack at Epstein's Upper East Side residence in 2002.

It also means that Black did not make a payment to settle the case.

Black had denied Pierson's allegation, filed in November 2022, that he had raped her in a suite at Epstein's mansion, where she had gone ""believing that she would give Black a massage and receive the money that had been promised her in exchange,"" according to her complaint.

Black, in a statement provided to CNBC on Monday, said, ""I have never met Ms. Pierson. I have no further comment.""

Black's lawyer, Danya Perry, in her own statement, said, ""This matter has been dismissed with prejudice. I will make no further comment.""

A spokeswoman for Wigdor LLP, the law firm that had represented Pierson, said, ""We have no comment at this time.""

Black in January 2023 agreed to pay $62.5 million to the U.S. Virgin Islands to be released from any potential claims related to the territory's probe of Epstein's sex-trafficking operation there.

Two years earlier, Apollo Global Management revealed that its then-CEO Black had paid Epstein $158 million for financial advice from 2012 through 2017 despite him knowing that Epstein had pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting sex for pay from and underage girl in Florida.

Black left Apollo in March 2021, months earlier than he previously had said he would.

Epstein, 66, killed himself in August 2019 in a federal jail in Manhattan, a month after he was arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.

Black in a letter Saturday separately withdrew his appeal of a judge's ruling in Pierson's case denying his motion for sanctions against Wigdor.

Black had claimed in that motion that Wigdor had ""repeatedly abused the court system to launder frivolous, unsubstantiated, and damaging accusations of sexual assault against Black across two lawsuits.""

The Wigdor law firm is continuing to pursue a separate lawsuit against Black that its attorneys filed in July, alleging that he raped a then-16-year-old girl with autism at Epstein's Manhattan home in 2002.

Another lawyer for Black last year said that he had never met the accuser, a woman in her 30s identified by the pseudonym Jane Doe in filings in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.",2/20/2024,-1,0.002218337,0.001256862,0.000494462,0.964782894,0.030877365,0.000370058

The U.S. economy has been surprisingly resilient in the face of the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy tightening over the last two years, defying expectations of a 2023 recession.

Though GSAM's base case is for the Fed to engineer a soft landing and for the U.S. economy to avoid recession, James Ashley, head of international market strategy, told CNBC on Wednesday that if a recession were to come, it would be this year.

""The Fed only began to hike in March of '22, so when we're talking about recession risks in 2023, that would have assumed a very rapid passthrough from the transmission of monetary policy into the real economy. In other words, it was premature,"" Ashley said.

""Monetary policy typically operates with a lag of about two years so if you're going to see that recession — and it is an 'if' statement, the base case is we don't get a recession — but if you were ever going to get a recession, it would be '24, not '23.""",3/27/2024,2,0.002623091,0.989780188,0.000939873,0.004181296,0.001953975,0.00052161

But, for the moment, it has bolstered only a handful of companies in what Goldman Sachs is calling the first phase of the AI trade.

In fact, investors will seek insight into where the AI chipmaker will go from here this week at Nvidia's GTC Conference, with many analysts increasing their price forecasts for the stock ahead of the event. Nvidia shares were up more than 2% on Monday. But other names are starting to emerge.

In the third phase, he expects companies using AI to lift their revenue will get a boost. Goldman Sachs anticipates the long-term winners are in the fourth and final phase. These companies will boost their bottom lines with the productivity gains unlocked by AI. Hammond expects companies in the software and services, commercial as well as and professional services sectors will be the biggest beneficiaries of the AI adoption here. ""'Phase 4' (Productivity gains) will focus on all companies harnessing AI technology to improve productivity, with the largest potential efficiency gains in labor-intensive industries with jobs more exposed to AI automation,"" Hammond wrote in a Thursday note. Here are some of the names the firm surfaced. One megacap name that surfaced was Amazon , which is already higher this year by more than 15%. However, Goldman Sachs said the productivity gains to be had from AI would boost earnings per share for the company by roughly 39%. Pinterest was another name that was identified by the Wall Street firm. The image-sharing platform has underperformed this year, and is down more than 7%. But Goldman Sachs said baseline earnings can jump 162% because of AI. The big-box retailer that can see sizable gains is Walmart . The company is up more than 15% this year. Goldman Sachs expects Walmart can eventually use automation to lower its labor costs. It predicts about 31% of its wage bill is exposed to AI. That means over time, Walmart could see a boost of 44% to earnings per share. The New York Times and Kohl's were other names that surfaced.",3/18/2024,-2,0.00109048,0.994019985,0.000584023,0.002666563,0.000979483,0.000659389

Kanzakura cherry trees herald the early arrival of spring in Tokyo.

Goldman Sachs now expects the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates for the first time in 17 years at its March meeting this week, bringing forward its previous forecast for an April decision.

The bank's senior Japan economist Tomohiro Ota cited stronger-than-expected salary gains at the annual ""shunto"" wages negotiations and subsequent Japanese news reports of an exit from negative rates at the BOJ's March meeting that ends Tuesday.

""The BOJ has not sent any signal denying the news so far,"" Ota wrote in a Monday note. ""Together, these developments imply that the BOJ probably no longer needs more data for the policy change, nor to wait to justify the policy change with the quarterly Economic Outlook report in April.""

While a slim majority of economists are still expecting the central bank to raise rate in April, an increasing number of economists have moved their forecasts forward to March in the last two weeks amid signs that salary negotiations this year will be far more robust than expected.

Ota said he expects the BOJ to abolish its yield curve control policy, which the central bank employs to target longer-term interest rates, by buying and selling bonds as necessary. Still, he expects the central bank will ""not explicitly commit"" to the size of its Japanese government bond purchases or the cessation of its ETF purchases.",3/18/2024,-2,0.013741884,0.857321918,0.004368701,0.079888374,0.042046133,0.002632983

While there, he began to learn the basics of how to make money on the market, namely the importance of figuring out one's individual investing goals and keeping a diverse portfolio.

""From my early days at Goldman Sachs, I learned the core principles of investing, finding solid ideas to build a diversified portfolio to create long-term wealth in a way that suits the customer,"" he said. ""Consider yourself the customer of this show.""

At Goldman, Cramer handled nondiscretionary accounts, meaning he worked on commission and needed clients' approval to invest their money in stocks he deemed worthwhile. In this role, he discovered the importance of being able to clearly articulate investing ideas before making any moves. He also learned that it's essential to figure out an investors' goals when building a portfolio, such as whether they can afford to take risks or would rather make safer investments.

It's also crucial not to turn trades into investments and vice versa, Cramer said. Investors shouldn't stick with or try to justify a losing stock, but when they've made a good pick, they should let it run. He also came to understand the value of diversification. When he first started at Goldman, he and his clients were eager to invest in oil. But when the price of the commodity eventually plummeted, those with oil-heavy portfolios got crushed.

""But you know who I really learned from? My customers, chiefly wealthy individuals from all walks of life,"" he said. ""At Goldman, I learned something that, to this day, can't be understood by so many professionals in this business: Individuals can and do beat the market quite regularly.""",3/11/2024,0,0.000785139,0.995999694,0.000533972,0.00132111,0.000730261,0.000629816

His comments come shortly after Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari became the latest high-profile official to float the possibility of zero rate cuts before the year's end, if inflation remained sticky.

""If we continue to see inflation moving sideways, then that would make me question whether we need to do those rate cuts at all,"" Kashkari said Thursday during an interview with Pensions & Investments.

Separately, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier in the week that it would take a while for policymakers to evaluate the current state of inflation, leaving the timing of potential interest rate cuts uncertain.

Market participants have been closely monitoring comments from Fed officials about the expected number of rate reductions due to take place this year, and many will be scouring Friday's U.S. jobs data for further clues on the labor market and inflation.

Speaking to CNBC's Steve Sedgwick on the sidelines of the Ambrosetti Spring Forum on Friday, Goldman Sachs' Hatzius said he was bullish on the outlook for the U.S. economy.

""I'm certainly optimistic on this year. On the growth side, we're well above consensus, close to 3% growth this year,"" Hatzius said.

""We're well below consensus in terms of the risk of a recession.

John Marshall of the firm's derivatives research team said in a March 27 note that earnings preannouncements have been a notable source of volatility in the opening months of 2024. ""We estimate there have been 433 preannouncements year-to-date and the average stock has moved +/-6.8% on the two days around these events,"" he wrote. ""This year stocks made positive moves following these events 57% of the time."" Further, a potentially busier time for those corporate disclosures is coming up. April sees about 10% of all preannouncements for a given year on average, according to Goldman Sachs. Given that earnings announcements can cause stock volatility, whether they are scheduled or not, this could create an opportunity for options traders to capitalize. Goldman identified stocks have preannounced in April at least twice since 2011, at least once in any month during the past two years, and have attractively priced options. ""Given the mostly unplanned nature of these events, we believe investors underestimate their associated volatility,"" the note said. Two companies that have made a habit of preannouncing in April are CNX Resources and Delta Air Lines . CNX, a natural gas company, has announced preliminary results in April four times since 2011, according to Goldman, while Delta has done so three times. The airline appears to be particularly aggressive with its preannouncements. Delta has done so six times over the past two years, not just in April. And Delta's stock has shown that it can see big swings on earnings-related news. Shares fell about 9% on Jan. 12 when the company announced its fourth-quarter results and trimmed its 2024 forecast. The stock has since erased that drop, but the sharp one-day move likely created some winners among options traders. DAL YTD mountain Shares of Delta Air Lines have rebounded since their Jan. 12 decline. Other companies like hospital conglomerate HCA Holdings and Fidelity National Information Services have done preannouncements in each of the last two years. Health care is a sector that sees a higher-than-average number of preannouncements, according to Goldman, which could bode well for traders interested in HCA. Consumer discretionary is another area that often sees a high number of preannouncements. Best Buy is one of the big consumer brands on Goldman's list. The retailer has done two April preliminary announcements since 2011. Of course, these early announcements can be good or bad news for the stock, but the options trade indicated by Goldman may work in either case. The note highlighted the at-the-money straddles for each stock, with the expiration date coming after the scheduled earnings date. Straddles are effectively a call option and a put option on the same stock with the same strike price. Straddles are more expensive up front than single-direction options, but they can make money whether a stock rises or falls. The trader takes no risk other than the premium paid up front to buy the options contract.",3/31/2024,-2,0.003224879,0.981457531,0.001105944,0.009958993,0.003002328,0.001250338

The S & P 500 spiked around 24% in 2023, recovering from a bear market in 2022. Stocks around the world also made gains, with the the FTSE All World Ex U.S. index jumping 16.2% in 2023. In a recent March note, Goldman Sachs said the recent rally has driven the share of market cap in stocks with ""extremely high valuations"" to levels similar to during the ""euphoria of 2021."" That stock outperformance happened despite higher yields, it noted. However, it believes that the prevalence of extreme valuations today looks ""far less widespread"" than in 2021 after adjusting for market concentration. Elsewhere, Goldman continues to forecast a faster pace of disinflation than what's in the European Central Bank's projections. Accordingly, it continues to predict that the ECB will deliver five back-to-back cuts this year and two cuts in the next. With that backdrop in mind, investors might be wondering which names have more upside. CNBC Pro trawled through Goldman's analyst research as well as latest global conviction lists to find stocks that made significant gains in 2023, but still have more than 30% potential upside in 2024, based on the bank's latest price targets.

The investment bank used a so-called "" dispersion score "" for each S & P 500 stock to identify ""the best stock-picking opportunities going forward."" The score is calculated based on (1) the proportion of trailing returns explained by micro, company-specific factors, not macro drivers; and (2) a forecast of the volatility tied to the portion of returns attributable to those micro factors, Goldman said in a 31-page report issued Friday. ""For fund managers, our forward-looking dispersion framework identifies stocks with the most attractive combination of micro-driven returns and firm-specific risk,"" David Kostin, Goldman's head of U.S. equity strategy, wrote in the note to clients. It's important to note that stocks with high dispersion scores reflect a large alpha opportunity , but not necessarily in one direction or the other, meaning a stock can have outsize outperformance or underperformance. Goldman found that among the 11 S & P 500 sectors, consumer discretionary and technology groupings offer the best stock-picking opportunities based on their dispersion scores, while real estate and utilities have the lowest scores, hence less chance of generating alpha. Stocks with the highest dispersion scores in the benchmark stock index are Monster Beverage , Dexcom , Akamai Technologies , Centene and Align Technology , according to Goldman.

The separately managed account, termed the ""Partnership,"" will be managed by Private Credit at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, with a staff based on the ground in various markets across the region. It will invest the long-term capital in ""high quality companies ... across the private credit spectrum"" across a number of Asia-Pacific markets.

The news follows Goldman's 2023 expansion in the Middle East with the opening of its office in Abu Dhabi Global Market, the financial center of the United Arab Emirates capital.

It also comes as the UAE and other Gulf states increase their economic footprint in India, which is set to be the fastest-growing G20 economy for the 2023-24 fiscal year. The UAE in October 2023 announced a target to invest $75 billion in India over a period of time, while Saudi Arabia set an investment target in the country of $100 billion.

The Wall Street investment bank is doubtful stocks can continue marching higher, citing the historically high valuations of the S & P 500 on both an aggregate and equal-weighted basis, according to a note last Friday. The broader index is trading at roughly 20 times price-to-earnings ratio on an aggregate basis (up from 17 times in October), and roughly 16 times on an equal-weighted basis (up from 14 times). In fact, the S & P 500 is currently at about the same valuation Goldman Sachs expected it to end 2024. Goldman Sachs originally expected the S & P 500 would end this year at 4,700, though it has since hiked its target to 5,100, according to the CNBC Strategist Survey. The broader index was last trading around 4,766. ""Our model of S & P 500 valuation suggests that the current elevated P/E multiple is appropriate, and we expect the market to trade at roughly the same valuation at yearend 2024,"" David Kostin wrote. ""However, this starting point also implies that valuation expansion is unlikely without a surprising further policy-driven decline in real Treasury yields."" Given this, investors looking for value in an overvalued market should try out three different trades. Kostin recommends traders buy small caps; own businesses with poor pricing power, where profits are likely to improve; and choose consumer staples over utilities. Small caps Investors should own small caps this year, Kostin said. The Russell 2000 is expected to rise 15% over the next 12 months, compared to an 8% gain for the S & P 500, the chief U.S. equity strategist said. In fact, he expects small caps should outperform even if the economy does not grow at the rate Kostin expects, with a 2.3% rise in gross domestic product for 2024, given the stocks' low valuations. ""The biggest risk is that investor expectations for economic growth deteriorate,"" Kostin wrote. ""However, low valuations provide a buffer: Based on current valuations, our model suggests that small-caps will generate positive returns even if 2024 GDP growth registers below our economists' forecast."" Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs predicted some small caps would beat large caps this year. Among the names that made the cut was broadcast and digital media company Tegna , an owner of 64 stations, which is slightly higher this year. It was down about 28% in 2023. Another pick was asset manager WisdomTree , which is up more than 5% in 2024. It surged 27% last year. Weak pricing power Another trade is owning businesses with weak pricing power. Not only are they currently trading at a discount to companies with strong pricing power, but they should get a boost as operating margins improve. Operating margin represents what's left of a company's revenue after paying for operating costs. ""Profit margins should also benefit from operating leverage in a solid economic growth environment,"" Kostin wrote. ""During periods of improving profitability, investors often reduce the scarcity premium assigned to strong pricing power stocks, and firms with less pricing power and more variable profit margins typically outperform."" Some companies with weak pricing power include Freshpet , according to a Goldman Sachs stock screen. In December, the pet food company was called a best idea for 2024 by TD Cowen, which saw a ""clearer path to profitability"" for the stock. Freshpet is down 2.5% in 2024, after surging more than 64% in 2023. Roblox was another stock pick, down about 13% in January after gaining 60% last year. D.R. Horton , Texas Roadhouse and Hertz Global Holdings were also recommended. Own consumer staples Meanwhile, consumer staples are at an attractive valuation compared to utilities. Consumer staples' earnings forecasts are nearing a bottom and, in addition, the sector tends to outperform during rate cutting cycles. ""Across 8 Fed cutting cycles since 1984, Consumer Staples has outpaced the S & P 500 75% of the time by a median of 7 [percentage points] during the 12 months following the first cut. In contrast, Utilities has outperformed just 25% of the time, lagging by a median of 4 pp,"" Kostin wrote. Some consumer staples companies that also have weak pricing power include Tyson Foods and Pilgrim's Pride . Tyson shares are up more than 1% this year, after falling 10% last year. Pilgrim's Pride is up 2% this year, adding to its 16% gain last year.",1/16/2024,2,0.000693963,0.000973742,0.000176524,0.001961801,0.995380402,0.000813638

(We're no longer recording the audio, so we can get this new written feature to members as quickly as possible.) Markets drop: There was another attempt to lift the market at the beginning of Friday's session, but it failed once again, putting the S & P 500 on track for a six-day losing streak. We keep pointing out that the rallies are happening too early in the session, leading the initial buyers to get caught by scalpers looking to make a quick trade. Volatile markets like this are when patience matters. We're still waiting for that truly ugly open before stepping up our buys. Until we see that crescendo, the oversold market means stay opportunistic but be gradual. That's been our approach this week, with our most-recent trade being a small buy of Estee Lauder on Thursday morning. Bad week for tech : Tech is getting hit hard again Friday, capping off a week in which the Nasdaq 100 fell by more than 5%. The biggest drag in the sector, by far, is Super Micro Computer . Shares of the artificial intelligence server maker were down as much as 20% Friday for a reason you don't see too often: The company hasn't preannounced earnings yet. Super Micro's stock has been one of the biggest winners in the market over the past couple of years due to the rapid construction of data centers around the world. Heavy investments in AI accelerated this trend. As demand for its rack-scale solutions and liquid-cooled systems surged, Super Micro's quarters kept getting better and better, resulting in earnings preannouncements in seven of the past eight quarters, including in January. Last month, the stock was added to the S & P 500. Entering this week, Super Micro was up more than 200% year to date. With earnings getting close on April 30, the fact Super Micro has yet to give a positive preannouncement is being viewed as negative, according to analysts at Wells Fargo. That doesn't mean Super Micro's quarter won't be good — we can't possibly know. But the recent fall in SMCI on no actual announcement is a reminder of a lesson that we shared earlier this year when markets were steadily making new highs: Always be fearful of parabolic moves and make sure you are taking gains on the way up because those kinds of moves are unstainable. Pockets of green: It's not all negative Friday. There's some pretty good strength in energy stocks, financials, consumer staples, health care, and real estate — a sign of money rotating out of hot momentum names and into other areas in the market. Shares of Club holding Coterra Energy rose nearly 2% on Friday, among the best performers in the portfolio. Do the work: Wells Fargo made a new 52-week high Friday, extending its weekly gains to more than 7%. Wells Fargo's strength follows a negative reaction to its first-quarter earnings report last week , even though the results were quite good. That's a theme we've noticed so far this earnings season. There's so much information coming out that sometimes the market gets sloppy and focuses on the wrong things, leading to misread results and ridiculous stock reactions. Fellow Club holdings Constellation Brands and Abbott Laboratories belong in this group, too. The lesson? Don't let the tape be the judge of a quarter. Instead, read the earnings materials and conference calls yourself because doing the work will help you spot opportunities. ""It's important to have confidence in investing. But confidence comes from doing the homework,"" Jim Cramer said Friday. Next week: Rest up over the weekend for an earnings barrage. Roughly 30% of the S & P 500 and 11 Dow components report earnings next week. Among the headliners are a trio of portfolio stocks — Alphabet , Microsoft and Meta Platforms — and beaten-up Tesla . But there are plenty of other big reports to sink our teeth into.

Almost 150 companies in the S & P 500 are due to report, including more than one-third of stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . Technology dominate the field, but results will also come from industrials, defense, energy, transportation, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals. Alphabet , Microsoft , Meta Platforms and Tesla are just a few of the headliners slated to release financials. Earnings from Humana , Comcast , Chubb , Visa and Chipotle will give investors more insight on the health of U.S. consumers. A company's earnings results are, of course, integral to both its near- and long-term performance. Results that surprise to the upside often push shares higher, while stocks that miss estimates are in danger of a pullback. As a result, CNPC Pro screened stocks slated to report their earnings next week for those that have a history of beating analysts' expectations.

They've also all averaged a subsequent post-earnings day gain of 2% or more, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group.

Traditionally, the company's stock has risen 2.3% on average within a day of its earnings announcement. Shares of Meta have soared 40% so far this year, through Wednesday, after almost tripling in 2023. Earlier this month, JPMorgan and Citi both reiterated Meta as a top stock pick, while Piper Sandler stood by an overweight rating on the stock. ""Bigger picture, with the broader online advertising environment strengthening and Meta's multi-year product strategy continuing to come into focus, Meta remains our Top-Pick and we are raising our projections and PT to $590,"" Citi wrote. Another name on the list is ServiceNow , also slated to release quarterly earnings after Wednesday's closing bell. The workflow automation platform beats earnings expectations 89% of the time. Shares of ServiceNow have historically risen 3.3% after posting its earnings, and have gained more than 4% this year after soaring 82% in 2023. Cloud software provider Five9 is the most consistent earnings outperformer on the list, with a record of beating estimates 98% of the time. To date, Five9 has plunged 28% this year, but the company's shares have risen an average of 4.0% following earnings. Five9 is slated to report its earnings next Thursday. Despite its underperformance, Baird in March named the stock its top pick among communications software businesses.

A slew of results are on deck this week, such as from U.S. Bancorp and KeyCorp , among others. For investors, what's key this earnings season is the impact elevated interest rates may have on regional banks' net interest income, as well as commentary around exposure to commercial real estate after New York Community Bank's troubles this year. Net interest income is the difference between the revenue generated from loans and the interest paid on deposits. ""What we've seen is deposit pressures escalate more than previously anticipated,"" said Alexander Yokum, an analyst at CFRA Research, who has a neutral view on regional banks. ""A lot of these regional banks, they have less deposits, so if they lose deposits, it can really impact their operating results,"" Yokum said. ""So, higher for longer, I think for a lot of regional banks, would be negative."" Thus far, reactions to results from the overall banking sector have been mixed. JPMorgan Chase shares dropped after the bank issued disappointing guidance on 2024 interest income, while Goldman Sachs shares climbed after the firm topped first-quarter estimates. M & T Bank shares rose this week post-earnings, while PNC shares on Tuesday dropped after its results. But some on Wall Street said they remain upbeat. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs' Ryan M. Nash said results are likely to be mixed, but that they ""should mark the bottom (or close to it for most)."" He continued, ""The move from 4-6 cuts down to 2-3 shouldn't have a meaningful impact on NII guides."" Bank of America's Ebrahim H. Poonawala said this month he expects first-quarter earnings results to demonstrate resiliency, adding ""regional banks with strong deposit franchises should be well-suited to compete in a structurally higher rate backdrop."" For investors, CFRA's Yokum maintained that it's important to remain a stock picker in the sector, adding they should choose firms that are well-capitalized with robust reserves. He also likes banks that are reducing their commercial real estate exposure. ""For banks, I think it's pretty important to be company-specific,"" Yokum said. ""I would really only pick the ones that you know, I feel like are strong from multiple categories."" Here's what Wall Street analysts expect from regional banks this season. U.S. Bancorp U.S. Bancorp , which is set to report earnings on Wednesday, is rated as buy by a majority of analysts covering the stock, according to LSEG data. But some analysts worry about the setup for the stock going forward. ""USB's capital overhang has largely been alleviated with the Fed releasing USB from requirements to comply with Category II requirements by year-end 2024,"" Citi's Keith Horowitz wrote in an April note. ""However, we continue to see downside to consensus estimates and USB trades at a relative premium on our implied cost of equity metric as the stock is viewed as high-quality and defensive, so we see better risk/reward elsewhere."" Horowitz has a neutral rating on U.S. Bank, as well as a price target of $45. The stock is down by more than 5% this year. Huntington Bancshares Huntington Bancshares is expected to release earnings on Friday. Shares of the Ohio-based firm have gained more than 2% this year, lagging the broader market. Analysts on average have a buy rating on the stock. Bank of America upgraded Huntington Bancshares to buy recently, saying the consensus view on Wall Street fails to appreciate the growth momentum in the bank. ""We view HBAN as well positioned to navigate multiple macro-economic outcomes,"" the firm's Poonawala wrote in an April note. ""Moreover, franchise investments and footprint should drive superior growth relative to most super-regional bank peers."" KeyCorp, Comerica KeyCorp and Comerica are both set to report earnings this week. Shares of Comerica and KeyCorp are down this year by 10% and 1%, respectively. Additionally, Comerica has a hold rating, according to CNBC's analyst consensus tool. ""Considering that their long-term rates are rising again, these are two banks that we think could have a tough couple of quarters here,"" CFRA's Yokum said. ""They both do have pretty significant unrealized losses, and their net interest margins have gotten hit pretty hard."" ""And they've seen pretty substantial non-interest bearing deposit outflows as well,"" Yokum added.

294,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/13/3-of-our-stocks-report-earnings-heres-what-we-want-to-see-from-each.html,HBAN,Huntington Bancshares,3 of our stocks report earnings next week. Here's what we want to see from each,"All three major averages posted losses in a volatile week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the way down, tanking more than 500 points on Friday alone, and ended the week with a 2.7% decline. The broad-based S & P 500 index dropped 1.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.5% The cause of the decline: A slightly hotter-than-expected March consumer price index (CPI) report on Wednesday pushed up Treasury bond yields and forced investors to reconsider the number of interest-rate cuts this year from the Federal Reserve. With the economy still humming along, it's less likely the central bank will make three cuts this year. As of Friday, the CME FedWatch Tool was indicating that the best odds are for two cuts this year, though there is still a chance we don't see any at all. We did gain back some ground on Thursday, thanks to a weaker-than-expected March producer price index (PPI) report — and perhaps the realization that a resilient economy isn't exactly a bad thing. Heightened tensions in the Middle East, including the possibility of Iran attacking Israel, sent stocks back down and oil prices higher. As we've said all year, we aren't investing based on rate-cut expectations. We acknowledge that it influences the price action in the short term — and want to take advantage of the dislocations the market's focus on this may cause — but possible cuts do not factor into our decisions on when, or where, to invest. We must also keep in mind that the number of rate cuts this year is the result of sustained economic strength. If the choice is between a weak economy with lower rates or a strong economy with higher rates, we'll take the strong economy every time. Low rates may help with valuation multiples, but it's a strong economy that leads to earnings growth and that's what we, as long-term investors care about. Looking ahead, we'll get a few notable macroeconomic reports to monitor, but the real driver of the action next week is earnings, including three in the portfolio. 1. Economists are estimating that March retail sales, to be released Monday, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.3% over February, according to FactSet. Retail sales don't provide a direct read on inflation but do represent a major part of GDP (consumption represents about two-thirds of U.S. GDP). That makes retail sales a good gauge of the economy's strength and what the Fed may do next with rates. If a soft landing — or maybe even no landing — scenario is going to play out it's crucial that private consumption stay strong even as the economy slows. 2. Shelter costs are a major sticking point for overall inflation, which makes Tuesday's housing starts and building permits report a key watch item. Economists are looking for 1.49 million starts and 1.515 million permits. We want to see as many starts and permits issued as possible. An increase in supply is crucial to stemming the rise in the shelter cost index. We'll get another look at housing with the release of the March existing home sales report on Thursday. 3. The March industrial production and capacity utilization report on Tuesday should provide some insight into the state of manufacturing, including consumer and business demand. The more end-market demand, the greater the production and utilization higher up in the supply chain. 4. Earnings : Three Club names will report quarterly results for the first quarter of 2024. Morgan Stanley : The strong investment banking results in Wells Fargo's report on Friday should bode well for Morgan Stanley. Higher equity prices, along with a rebound in M & A activity and the IPO market, are also good indicators. With that in mind, investor focus will be on the margins in wealth management and a regulatory probe into that division we learned about Thursday. Wealth management is a key source of fee-based revenue generation that investors want to see continue to grow over time, so any details from the management team will be welcome. Abbott Labs : Outside of any commentary about the ongoing baby formula litigation, we're focused on organic growth. The company reported an 11% increase in organic growth for its underlying base business — which excludes the impact of divesting the pediatric nutrition business in China, the impact of the Cardiovascular Systems acquisition and Covid testing revenues — and we are looking for that strong momentum to continue. As noted in Friday's Morning Meeting , we don't expect this management team to alter guidance if the bottom line comes in stronger than expected. No matter how strong, this management team doesn't update guidance after the first quarter. The team prefers to stay conservative and get more of the year behind it before updating. In terms of key segments, the Street is looking for a little over 6% growth in the nutrition business, 4% growth in established pharmaceuticals, and 10% growth in medical devices, Abbott's largest division. Diagnostics is expected to be down nearly 17% versus the year-ago period as we lap Covid testing sales. Procter & Gamble : The consumer goods giant is expected to show growth in all key segments —beauty, grooming, health care, fabric care and home care, and baby care and family care — with overall organic sales rising 3.5% over last year. On Thursday, Constellation Brands showed it grew sales on volume, not by raising prices, and we expect to see the same from PG. That said, Procter & Gamble's investments in innovation have provided it with a good deal of pricing power. More importantly, the company's products are usually the better value, even if they come with a slightly higher sticker price versus the competition. Is management seeing more trade-downs? We're optimistic consumers are sticking with value.

The equity market has pulled back since Monday morning, with the major averages on pace for a losing week. But overall, U.S. equities remain in a bull market, as a handful of mega-cap technology stocks lift the market. For example, Nvidia was the only one of the Magnificent Seven to advance this week, gaining more than 7%. The AI chipmaker has already soared 79% in 2024. Still, investors are concerned the recent bull move has left many stocks' valuations overextended, setting them up to fail if lofty expectations aren't met. CNBC Pro searched for stocks that are looking particularly overextended, searching for names trading above their average price-to-earnings ratios, with first-quarter earnings-per-share estimates that have come down from the beginning of the year. Here are the criteria we used: Market cap greater than $1 billion Next twelve month P/E that is greater than the 5 year average P/E Current quarter earnings per share (EPS) estimates down since year began At least five analysts cover the stock Trading more than 5% above analysts' consensus price target These names surfaced on our screen. Mercury Systems , an aerospace and defense company, has a next 12 months price-to-earnings ratio of 191, far above its five-year average P/E of 94, implying the stock is extremely overvalued. Another troubling signal? Consensus estimates for first quarter earnings have declined. In December, analysts anticipated earnings of 52 cents per share. The estimate now calls for a loss of 3 cents per share. Analysts' consensus price target also implies Mercury Systems shares will fall more than 13%. Old Dominion Freight Line came up as an overextended name. The trucking and transportation stock has a next 12 months P/E of almost 34, more than its five-year average below 32. Earnings per share expectations have fallen to $2.71 per share, down from a December estimate of $2.86 earnings per share. Analysts' average price target implies that Old Dominion stock will fall more than 5%. Dollar General also looked overvalued based on our screen. The discount chain sells for about 21 times the next 12 months' estimated earnings, slightly above its five-year average P/E of 20.3. Its earnings per share estimate has declined to $1.85 currently, down from $1.86 at the end of last year, while its average price target suggests a more than 7% fall for the stock from current levels.

""The core business we see as healthy,"" Gelsinger said. ""We see no areas for market share loss and the products are getting stronger.""

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said on a call with analysts that the core businesses — PC and server chips — would be at the low end of the company's seasonal range in the current quarter, but that overall sales would take a hit because of weakness in subsidiaries including Mobileye and its programmable chip unit, as well as revenue decreases from other businesses the company has spun off or sold.

For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Intel expects adjusted earnings per share of 13 cents on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue. The company projects a fiscal first-quarter net loss of 25 cents per share on a GAAP basis.

Here's how Intel did versus LSEG (formerly Refinitiv) consensus expectations for the quarter ended in December:

Intel shares dropped more than 10% on Friday after the chipmaker issued an outlook for the first quarter of 2024 that lagged analyst forecasts even as results for the latest quarter beat Wall Street estimates.

Intel posted net income of $2.7 billion, or 63 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $700 million, or 16 cents per share, last year.

With Intel reporting sales growth in the fourth quarter of 10% from $14.04 billion a year earlier, the company breaks a streak of seven quarters with declining revenue. Intel's full-year gross margin was 40%, down 2.6 percentage points annually.

Intel shares are up more than 74% over the past year. The company is the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, according to Gartner, a market research firm, even though its market cap puts it below Nvidia and AMD on Wall Street.

Cloud providers and large tech companies, the big spenders, have been focused on the AI boom, which explains Nvidia's recent outperformance. In the past, the most important part in a server was the central processor made by Intel. Now, AI servers can have as many as eight Nvidia or AMD graphics processing units (GPUs) attached to one or two Intel CPUs.

""The data center has seen some wallet share shift between CPU and accelerators over the last several quarters,"" said Intel CFO David Zinsner on a call with analysts Thursday.

Intel also continues to focus on a five-year plan implemented by Gelsinger, who took over the chipmaker in 2021. Intel wants to catch up to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. in its ability to offer manufacturing services to other companies, while also improving its own branded chips.

""The quarter capped a year of tremendous progress on Intel's transformation,"" Gelsinger said in a statement. Intel said Thursday that it would restate past results under a new system where the company has to account for costs related to internal manufacturing of its own chips.

Intel Foundry Services, its business making chips for other companies, remains nascent, with $291 million in revenue, a 63% annual increase.

Intel has been cutting costs through workforce reductions and offloading small parts of its business. In the past year, the company said it would spin off its programmable chip unit, after turning self-driving car subsidiary Mobileye into an independent company in 2022. Zinsner said that Intel had cut $3 billion in costs last year and the company spun off or sold five different business lines.

Intel's largest division is its Client Computing group, which includes laptop and PC processor chips. The overall PC industry has been in a slump for two years, but recently started showing signs of growth again. Intel reported $8.8 billion in fourth-quarter sales, up 33%.

Gelsinger said that demand for PC chips had ""normalized,"" and that sales were strong in the gaming and commercial sectors. He added that Intel expects the total PC market to expand this year.

Intel's second-biggest division, Data Center and AI, saw sales decline 10% to $4 billion. That unit includes server CPUs and GPUs. Intel's Network and Edge department, which sells parts for carriers and networking, reported $1.5 billion in sales, down 24% from last year.

Zinsner said that Intel expected its Data Center business to decline ""double-digit"" percentages sequentially in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter.

Intel said it paid $3.1 billion in dividends in 2023.

Skylo raised $37 million through an equity round, the company told CNBC, that was led by Intel Capital and Innovation Endeavors and joined by BMW i Ventures, Next47, Samsung Catalyst Fund and Seraphim Space. The raise brings Skylo's total equity fundraising to $153 million, with prior investors including SoftBank and DCM.

Founded in 2017 and headquartered in Mountain View, California, the company is pursuing the nascent ""direct-to-device,"" or D2D, satellite communications market.

But instead of building next-generation satellites, Skylo aims to provide a network to connect new devices — including low-bandwidth Internet of Things hardware as well as high-bandwidth smartphones — via existing satellites, but without extra antennas or bulky equipment.

""We want ubiquitous connectivity. We just don't want extra hardware, because that adds complexity,"" Skylo CEO Parth Trivedi told CNBC.

Trivedi said he believes his company can bring the standards-based networks of the telecom industry to the ""walled garden"" of proprietary satellite technology. His company is working to build a software infrastructure to certify chips and devices as capable of connecting to satellites in orbit.

That way, Trivedi sees Skylo operating as a ""roaming partner"" to existing cellular networks, effectively rubber-stamping and linking devices made by other connectivity players.

""You're going to find that this approach is very, very scalable, because the carriers don't have to change behavior, the users don't have to change behavior, the satellite operators don't have to change behavior, and regulators don't have to change behavior,"" Trivedi said.

The company has partnerships with chipset makers including Qualcomm, Samsung, MediaTek and Sony. Already, Skylo has certified a number of those companies' IoT chips and is in the process of certifying more for wearable devices and smartphones.

""Older phones are not going to be certified on our network. It's all the new devices that are coming out that have the correct chipset in them and then we work with the [original equipment manufacturer] to get that device certified ... by the end of this year, most major smartphone modems will support the Skylo network,"" Trivedi said.

Dave Johnson, a managing director at Intel Capital, explained that his fund's backing is the result of its belief that Skylo is on the leading edge of the D2D satellite opportunity.

""They've really smartly used existing infrastructure wherever possible. They've also done a very good job of engineering the end-to-end solution, so that it's seamless and easy for customers to adopt,"" Johnson told CNBC.",2/13/2024,0,0.010896745,0.830324233,0.006071156,0.130557299,0.020031987,0.00211855

U.S. chip giant Advanced Micro Devices is betting on AI PCs to take on rivals including Nvidia and Intel as the AI race heats up.

""[The market for] AI PCs is going to continue to expand,"" said Victor Peng, president of AMD, in an exclusive interview with CNBC on Thursday. He added that the firm expects more adoption of AI PCs in the second half of the year.

These are personal computers embedded with processors specifically designed to perform AI functions such as real-time language translation.

Tech research firm Canalys in a December report said the boom in generative AI is expected to boost PC sales as consumers are seeking devices with AI features, predicting that 60% of the PCs shipped in 2027 will be AI-capable.

An explosion of interest in AI was sparked by the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 as the chatbot went viral for its ability to generate human-like responses to users' prompts.

HP president and CEO Enrique Lores said on the fourth-quarter earnings call in November that the firm was ""really excited about the impact that AI PCs are going to have in the overall PC category"" but it would ""take some time"" before it penetrates deep into the market.

Intel shares slumped 12% on Friday for their steepest drop since July 2020, after the chipmaker issued a forecast for the current quarter that came in far short of analysts' estimates.

In its earnings report late Thursday, Intel beat on profit and revenue, but the chipmaker said it expected adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share this quarter on between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion in sales. Analysts were expecting earnings of 33 cents per share on $14.15 billion of revenue, according to LSEG, formerly Refinitiv.

Intel's revenue guidance for the first quarter was below every analyst's estimate, according to CNBC research.

While some parts of the semiconductor industry are booming because of strong demand for artificial intelligence chips, other server parts, such as the central processing units, or CPUs, that Intel makes, don't have the same kind of momentum.

The consensus analyst estimate for Intel's earnings for the second, third and fourth quarters of Intel's 2024 all fell on Friday.

Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger told analysts on the earnings call that first-quarter sales performance would take a hit because of weakness at Mobileye , where Intel owns a majority stake, as well as in the company's programmable chip unit.

He also said the company's core businesses of PC and server chips remained ""healthy"" and would report sales at the low end of the seasonal range.

""While such a large miss is clearly a negative, we are somewhat encouraged that the drivers of the incremental weakness are largely outside of INTC's 'core' PC/DC CPU segments,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Seymour Ross wrote in a note Friday.

As of Friday afternoon, Intel shares were trading at $43.68. They're down 13% for the year after almost doubling in 2023.

""Keratin is a common protein found in skin,"" according to Dr. Rebecca Hartman, an assistant professor of dermatology at Harvard Medical School. It can also be found in hair and nails. ""In a keratin treatment, stylists will use heat to seal a keratin product into the hair,"" Hartman adds.

The ""reported benefits"" of using keratin treatments on hair are adding shine, reducing frizz and straightening hair with a longer-lasting effect than heat alone, she says.

DON'T MISS: I chemically straightened my hair for 7 years. Now there’s a link between ‘relaxers’ and higher risk of uterine cancer in Black women like me

But researchers are finding associations between using products that contain ingredients that many keratin treatments have and harmful effects on health.

""I think the real issue is not the keratin protein itself, which as I mentioned is in our skin, but other products that could be in such treatments,"" Hartman says.

""The FDA is considering a ban on hair straightening products that contain or emit formaldehyde. And actually, people can go and comment on this. They're going to collect the comments, and then by April 2024 make a decision.""

Researchers discovered a link between frequent use of chemical hair straighteners and uterine cancer, especially in Black women, in 2022. Exposure to high amounts of formaldehyde has been linked to certain cancers, according to the American Cancer Society.

""We're seeing a rise in a certain aggressive subtype of uterine cancer, and black women actually have the highest risk of this aggressive subtype called non-endometrioid uterine cancer,"" Hartman says. ""And interestingly, in the study looking at who uses hair straighteners, the majority were black women.""

This finding has led to the FDA taking a closer look at various keratin treatments that ""claim to be formaldehyde-free but contain a substance called methylene glycol, which converts to formaldehyde gas after coming in contact with air,"" according to the New York Times.",3/7/2024,0,0.002568135,0.987502098,0.001527405,0.005813133,0.001950081,0.000639262
307,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/06/companies-offering-401k-matching-for-student-loan-payments.html,IPG,Interpublic Group of Companies (The),Companies can now help workers pay off student debt while saving for retirement—these 3 already offer the benefit,"Over 43 million Americans currently have federal student loan debt. Though many, if not all, of those borrowers probably want to retire one day, it can be difficult to balance making your monthly student loan payment and investing for the future. In fact, 66% of borrowers said they had to reduce their retirement contributions as payments on federal student loans resumed last fall, according to a survey from Allianz Life. But companies can now help their employees meet these goals. The Secure 2.0 Act went into effect this year, codifying the ability for employers to match workers' student loan payments with a contribution to their 401(k), 403(b) or other retirement account. Offering a 401(k) match is a popular benefit: 98% of employers that offer 401(k) plans match some level of employee contributions, according to a 2013 survey of over 400 plan sponsors. But employees may not be able to afford a retirement contribution, let alone one that earns them the full match, if they're overburdened with monthly student debt payments. At least three large employers — Abbott, Verizon and Chipotle — currently offer 401(k) matching for employees making student loan payments. Here's a look at how each company's plan works.

Leading the charge: Abbott's Freedom 2 Save program

Prior to the passage of Secure 2.0, employers were technically allowed to offer matching 401(k) contributions for student loan payments, but there wasn't a clear legal pathway to do so. When Abbott, a health-care technology company with over 115,000 employees worldwide, wanted to help its employees struggling with student debt back in 2018, the company had to get special approval from the Internal Revenue Service. A private letter ruling from the IRS allowed Abbott to create its Freedom 2 Save benefit six years ago, which allows employees who put 2% or more of their salary toward student loans to get a 5% retirement contribution from Abbott. All employees are eligible to participate in the benefit, according to an Abbott representative. Over 2,800 employees have enrolled in Freedom 2 Save since its launch in 2018. The program helped inspire the Secure 2.0 provision that makes it easier for companies to adopt similar plans to assist their student loan borrower workforces, according to Abbott. The company recently created a blueprint detailing the advantages of offering a student loan repayment benefit and guidance for other organizations to design their own programs. ""We've received many inquiries about Freedom 2 Save since launching the program...Interest definitely increased in the past year as people prepared for the approval of SECURE 2.0,"" says Mary Moreland, executive vice president of human resources at Abbott. ""We're receiving positive feedback on the blueprint and know that it's being downloaded by a diverse group of companies across various industries.""

Verizon: Secure Your Future

Verizon recently introduced a student loan payment match to help support its employees. Employees who enroll in Verizon's Secure Your Future program can earn up to a 6% retirement contribution match while paying their student loans. Employees can get the full 6% retirement contribution match by making their student loan payments, making their own contribution, or a combination of the two, Kevin Cammarata, vice president of benefits at Verizon, tells CNBC Make It. For example, an employee could put 3% of their annual salary toward their student loans and 3% toward their 401(k) and Verizon will make a 6% retirement contribution on their behalf. ""We really don't want people missing out on that 6% match for a variety of reasons, the least of which [being that] the best time [to] start saving for retirement is right away,"" Cammarata says. The program launched in December and over 500 employees enrolled on the first day, according to Cammarata. Both full and part-time employees are eligible to sign up as soon as they start working at the company. ""I think [employees] appreciate both the awareness of student loans as a debt burden, but also the flexibility they have so they don't feel like they have to miss out on this 401(k) match,"" he says.

Today, the bestselling coconut water company is worth $1.1 billion. But it wasn't born out of a Silicon Valley startup lab. Rather, co-founders Michael Kirban and Ira Liran first thought about going into the coconut water business after a chance meeting in a Manhattan bar on a cold night in 2003, when two Brazilian women told them the beverage was what they missed most about their homeland.

Liran ended up falling in love with one of those women, and moving to Brazil. When Kirban visited them, he realized just how popular coconut water — which has a salty-sweet taste and high levels of hydrating electrolytes — was in the Southern Hemisphere, especially compared to the U.S.

The two friends decided to jump on what they saw as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

""People in Brazil were drinking it for everything,"" Kirban, 48, tells CNBC Make It. ""They were drinking it at the breakfast table. They were drinking it on the beach. They were drinking it after a workout ... We're like, 'There's got to be a consumer in the U.S.'""

Liran and Kirban struck a deal with a supplier in Brazil to produce their first shipment, for $75,000. They paid mostly with Kirban's money, which he'd obtained by founding and running a real estate software business after dropping out of college. That software business still exists, and Kirban still helps run it on the side, he says.

The shipment got held up at the border by U.S. officials. The co-founders hadn't realized they needed to register it with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which meant they had to divert it to the Bahamas, where Kirban says he ""sold it door to door"" at bars, grocery stores and even ""people's homes.""

The bottom line

Bitcoin just received its biggest stamp of approval, giving crypto bros their most powerful bragging rights yet. The decision by the SEC to approve the creation and trading of bitcoin ETFs will allow for better adoption of the world's oldest cryptocurrency by mainstream finance. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, that holds about $29 billion of the cryptocurrency, will likely be converted into an ETF following the decision, while big Wall Street's BlackRock and Fidelity will also enter the playing field. ""Today's news is possibly Bitcoin's biggest since its launch but the approval of spot ETFs shouldn't be viewed in isolation, given the timing of the upcoming halving in April which cuts the BTC supply and historically kickstarts the new bull market. Both these events combined could well send Bitcoin to $100,000 in 2024,"" said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder and managing partner of the digital asset firm Nexo. Trenchev also noted that ""there is a temptation to say the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs is a buy-the-rumour, sell-the-news event."" The decision comes a day after an official SEC social media account falsely said bitcoin ETF trading had been approved. The SEC confirmed that the account had been compromised. Later in the day, investors will also shift focus towards consumer price data which is expected to show inflation edged higher in the last month of 2023. This could potentially bring into question whether markets are getting ahead of themselves in anticipating rate cuts by the Fed.

A highly anticipated and controversial decision finally arrived Wednesday, with the Securities and Exchange Commission allowing the creation of bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the U.S. that will give regular investors access to the world's oldest and most popular cryptocurrency. The first funds are set to start trading on Thursday. The price of bitcoin, however, shed about 2%.

Wall Street ends higher

U.S. stocks ended Wednesday's trading session higher as investors awaited the start of earnings season later in the week and also inflation data. Jump in shares of Intuitive Surgical and Lennar boosted markets. In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei 225 index breached the 35,000 mark for the first time since February 1990.

China woos investors

China has now vowed to make foreign investments easier, as was reported by state media. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng met with global financial executives Wednesday at a time China's tensions with the U.S. and worries about its economic growth have kept investors wary of putting money into the country.

Inflation report awaited

December inflation data, set to be released on Thursday, could very well challenge the market's perception of how soon the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates and by how much. Consumer prices would've likely edged higher last month, with expectations by Dow Jones pointing to a 0.2% rise in the final month of 2023, and 3.2% increase for the full year.

President Joe Biden's $140 million campaign war chest has been bolstered by a group of loyal advisers and fundraisers that some party strategists call a ""dream team"" effort to defeat the likely Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump.

The recent boom in fundraising can be traced primarily to five people: media executive and Biden campaign co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg, former State Department official Rufus Gifford, campaign finance director Michael Pratt, longtime Biden adviser Jen O'Malley Dillon and Julie Chávez Rodriguez, the president's 2024 campaign manager.

""They have kind of put together a dream team in fundraising,"" said Jim Messina, who served as former President Barack Obama's campaign manager for his successful 2012 reelection campaign.

Katzenberg has been speaking with donors to Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley and trying to recruit them to support Biden. ""We are actively courting them,"" he told CNBC in a recent interview.

""I've only done it with a handful of super high end donors and I would just say it has been well received. No one has said 'leave us alone, we don't want to talk to you,'"" said Katzenberg

Haley insists she is staying in the race, despite polls showing her on track to lose Saturday's Republican primary in her home state of South Carolina to Trump.

But Katzenberg pointed to Haley's support in places like New Hampshire, where she won 43% of the Republican primary vote, saying that suggests there is a slice of the Republican party ready to move on from Trump.

CNBC spoke to over half a dozen Biden advisers, party fundraisers and Democratic strategists for this piece, several of whom were granted anonymity to share private conversations. They described how key players in a constellation of groups -- Biden's campaign committee, joint fundraising committees, his chief outside political action committee and the Democratic National Committee -- have amassed $140 million to put towards the president's reelection.

Their efforts have given Biden a significant advantage in the money race over Trump, whose political fundraising operation is paying for both his campaign and his attorneys in a host of civil and criminal cases.

Trump's campaign and allied political organizations began the year with a combined $65 million in cash on hand, according to Federal Election Commission records. This was after paying roughly $50 million to the former president's lawyers in 2023.

""President Trump's campaign is fueled by small dollar donors across the country from every background,"" Karoline Leavitt, the national press secretary for Trump's campaign, said in a statement to CNBC. ""We are more confident than ever that he will take back the White House in November.""",2/22/2024,0,0.003175771,0.134772092,0.843759418,0.016045099,0.000976308,0.001271402

Sarah Gilbert spends a lot of time on Reddit. For the past three years, she's helped moderate the r/AskHistorians subreddit, which has 2 million members and was the subject of her Ph.D. dissertation. She's been a lurker on the forum since 2012. But when the subject turns to Reddit's upcoming IPO, Gilbert's excitement wanes. The 19-year-old social media company set aside 8% of the shares in its offering for certain users and moderators, along with some company insiders and their friends and family members. Airbnb , Rivian and Doximity employed a similar model when they went public, as a way to reward power users or early customers. Reddit's initial public offering is different. While its predecessors hit the market during a record IPO stretch in 2020 and 2021, Reddit's planned New York Stock Exchange debut this week will be the first major tech offering of the year, and lands after a major reckoning in the industry that was highlighted by tumbling valuations, reduced investment and an emphasis on profit over growth. The two venture-backed tech debuts of 2023 — Instacart and Klaviyo — failed to pop, a sign that getting in at the IPO price no longer equals free money. It's not just market conditions that have Reddit moderators like Gilbert forgoing the investment opportunity. Reddit has long had a rocky relationship with moderators and the site's most dedicated users, or Redditors. Following a user protest last year stemming from a policy change that forced some third-party developers to pay more for use of the company's application programming interface (API), Reddit CEO Steve Huffman compared site moderators to ""landed gentry.""

Gilbert, who works as a research manager at Cornell University's Citizens and Technology Lab, said the bad blood from the conflict has ""really sort of knocked a lot of the goodwill and the energy"" from those who had been spending the most time and effort on trying to build up communities on the site. It's hard for her to now see the appeal in paying money to own a piece of the company and betting on its future. ""It's like, OK, you've invested your time, you've invested your emotional well-being and put yourself at risk, now invest your money into this platform too,"" Gilbert said. ""It doesn't really feel like Reddit is necessarily giving back, so much as it feels like maybe it's asking for even more.""

Reddit, a site with 60,000 daily active moderators hosting forums on topics from the mainstream to the extremely obscure, plans to sell shares at $31 to $34 a piece in its IPO, potentially valuing the company at around $6.5 billion, and trade under ticker symbol ""RDDT."" At the tech market peak in 2021, Reddit was valued by private investors at $10 billion, according to PitchBook. Reddit's directed share program, or DSP, is intended for certain U.S.-based users with high site-wide reputations — measured in so-called Karma points — or for moderators, as a way to ""recognize those who have contributed significantly to Reddit over the years,"" the company said in explaining the offering. In total, Reddit said underwriters have reserved 1.76 million of the 8 million shares in the IPO for the DSP. Some invitees say they're worried about the company's financial situation. Reddit recorded a net loss of $90.8 million last year, an improvement from 2022, when its deficit came it at $158.6 million. The company said in its prospectus that it's racked up a cumulative loss of $716.6 million. Reddit is competing for advertising dollars in a notoriously difficult market against the likes of Google and its YouTube service, Facebook 's apps and TikTok. In its filing, Reddit also names as competitors Wikipedia, Snap , X, Pinterest , Roblox , Discord and Amazon's Twitch. A moderator with username BuckRowdy, who spoke on condition that his real name not be disclosed, told CNBC that he's passing on the IPO, and said his sentiment appears to be widely shared. ""People do seem to have like a negative view that it's going to go down immediately or you're going to lose money,"" said BuckRowdy, who moderates subreddits including r/UnresolvedMysteries and r/TrueCrime. ""I don't see anybody in any spaces I'm in that are taking it seriously, that are thinking of it as an investment or anything along those lines."" Reddit didn't provide a comment for this story.

Meme stocks

Of all companies, Reddit knows something about stock market volatility. The site is home to the infamous r/wallstreetbets subreddit that helped spur the 2021 boom in meme stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment , which rose with meteoric speed despite any changes in their business fundamentals. It's a risk the company acknowledges in its IPO filing: ""Given the broad awareness and brand recognition of Reddit, including as a result of the popularity of r/ wallstreetbets among retail investors, and the direct access by retail investors to broadly available trading platforms, the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could experience extreme volatility for reasons unrelated to our underlying business or macroeconomic or industry fundamentals, which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment if you are unable to sell your shares at or above the initial offering price."" Joshua White, an assistant professor of finance at Vanderbilt University, said Reddit's DSP could be ""nice stocking stuff"" if it were to follow the lead of companies that went public in 2020 and 2021. ""This is usually a good deal because really hot IPO stocks typically go up on the first day,"" White said. However, given the dearth of tech IPOs since the start of 2022, White said Reddit's offering is ""probably a little more risky.""

watch now

While there's plenty of skepticism heading into the IPO, some Redditors appear poised to get in on the action, based on forum commentary. A Reddit user with the handle FormicaDinette33 said in the r/RedditIPO subreddit that they plan to purchase 10 shares ""just to experience the process,"" while SpindriftRascal plans to spend $5,000, an amount allowing them to ""to be happy if it does well and not care much if it tanks,"" according to a post. Sweatycat, a moderator of the r/IAmA and r/LifeProTips subreddits, plans to participate in the IPO, telling CNBC they ""both like Reddit as a company and see this as a potentially good investment opportunity."" The Redditor, who asked not to be identified further, said other moderators may have ""mixed feelings"" about Reddit going public because of their ""strained relationship"" with management. For wrestlegirl, who moderates the AEWOfficial subreddit for over 100,000 wrestling fans, the stock purchase program is ""a nice enough thing to offer, but it's not a reward of any sort"" and doesn't project to be a ""long-term stable investment."" Wrestlegirl, who also asked not to be named, told CNBC that owning the stock may be ""something fun to have or an amusing experience to talk about later, but I don't think anyone is actually taking Reddit's public offering seriously.""

'It's being mocked so much'

Akaash Maharaj is ineligible for the program as a Canadian resident. He said he would decline an invitation to participate even if he could, largely because of concerns about the business. He also says moderators shouldn't be motivated to improve the company's share price at the expense of the ""long-term identity of the platform."" ""There are very few Redditors who I would say are enthusiastic about the IPO,"" Maharaj told CNBC. For roughly five years, Maharaj has helped moderate the forum r/Equestrian, consisting of 72,000 horse lovers. He's also a member of the Reddit Mod Council, a select group of power users who gather with the goal of improving the site and, in his words, to ""make decisions that are in everyone's interest."" ""Our track record there is mixed,"" Maharaj said, with a chuckle. Even though he's dubious about the IPO and not particularly bullish on the stock, Maharaj said the DSP could be a ""very shrewd"" way for management to invite participation and fend off any effort by the Reddit community to spoil a major moment in the company's history. ""Had they not done that, there would have been a heightened risk that more Redditors would have rhetorically run down the stock as it goes to market,"" Maharaj said. The company is saying, ""Look, buy some shares and you might make money, but you only make money if you don't do something to disrupt the IPO itself,"" he said. Wrestlegirl said that despite the swarm of negativity she's seeing among moderators, she thinks a decent number of them will participate in the IPO. ""It's being mocked so much it's almost a meme,"" she said. ""I think a lot of those jeering secretly don't want to be left out of things if this turns into a GameStop."" Courtnie Swearingen says she won't be one of them. Swearingen, an attorney, has been a Reddit moderator for about 13 years, currently for forums on music and on her hometown of Chicago. Over that time, she's built up a distrust of the company. In 2015, after the controversial firing of a Reddit employee named Victoria Taylor, hundreds of moderators locked their subreddits in a protest effort led by Swearingen. Swearingen told CNBC that after that ordeal, Reddit flew her and other moderators to San Francisco to collect feedback and to clear the air. But she hasn't seen much change for the better, and no longer expects it. ""Every time anything is promised, or new ideas are presented, it's never done well and it never goes well,"" Swearingen said. ""Even with the opportunity to buy in, I would not. I cannot risk money on a company that I haven't been able to trust for a decade."" — CNBC's Cameron Costa contributed to this report",3/20/2024,0,0.006655319,0.951910555,0.001762008,0.030575665,0.007721881,0.001374508

Donald Trump's reelection campaign has begun to see warning signs that the small-dollar donors who fueled his last run for the White House have slowed their support to the former president this year, according to people familiar with the matter. Since late last year, members of Trump's team have been warned by Republican Party advisors that their small-dollar donor base could be shrinking, said the sources, who were granted anonymity to discuss internal campaign matters. Some have even been told there may not be much that the former president or his campaign can do to win back these key donors, the sources explained. The drop in Trump's small-dollar contributors could be significant obstacle as the former president faces the well-funded incumbent president, Democrat Joe Biden.

Falling behind Biden

Evidence from earlier in the 2024 election cycle already hinted at an erosion of Trump's small-dollar donor base, or support of $200 or less. In 2023, Trump's reelection campaign raised 62.5% less money from small-dollar donors than it did in 2019, the year before the last presidential election. In January of this year, Trump's campaign reported raising around $3 million from small-dollar donors, according to data from OpenSecrets. This may sound like a lot of money, but consider that Biden's political operation raised nearly $2 million in just one day, Feb. 29, according to a campaign spokesman for the president. Presidential campaigns have until March 20 to file their February fundraising disclosures to the Federal Election Commission and the public. Before that date, both sides try to shape the narrative by either playing up expectations or tamping them down. For example, Biden's campaign announced it raised $10 million in just the 24 hours following the president's March 7 State of the Union address. But those numbers won't be disclosed to the FEC until next month.

Meanwhile, Trump's campaign told The New York Times that February was its strongest month so far in the 2024 campaign cycle for small-dollar donations. When CNBC asked a Trump spokesperson precisely how much was raised, the campaign did not reply. One factor nobody disputes is that small-dollar donors are critical to Trump's ability to raise enough money to fund his presidential campaign. During his failed 2020 reelection campaign, the $378 million he raised from small-dollar contributions represented almost half of the total cash. The lion's share of this money was raised during the final year of the campaign. Between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 2020, Trump's campaign raised over $264 million from small-dollar supporters. Trump's struggle with small-dollar contributors so far this quarter could be due to donors not engaging as much with his often bombastic online pitches as they have in the past. It could also be the result of donor fatigue after nearly nine years of supporting him with contributions, people close to the Trump fundraising effort acknowledged.

Problems with big money

The drop in Trump's small-dollar donations is magnified by a second problem: Many wealthy Republican donors have yet to commit to giving millions of dollars toward a pro-Trump political action committee, or to using their extensive networks to raise money for the campaign, according to people familiar with the matter. Beyond Trump-specific entities, some donors are also hesitant to fund the Republican National Committee, or a newly created joint fundraising committee that will raise money for the RNC, Trump's campaign and dozens of state GOP parties, according to people briefed on the matter. Their reluctance stems, in part, from concerns that the RNC will use the money not to help elect Republicans, but to pay for Trump's extensive legal fees, sources said. Republican leaders insist they have no such plans. But recent developments within the Trump campaign and the party suggest that donors' concerns might be warranted.

A newly established joint fundraising committee, the Trump 47 Committee, plans to split proceeds between the RNC, Trump's campaign, state parties and — crucially — Save America, the Trump-affiliated leadership PAC that spent $24 million on the former president's legal bills in the latter half of 2023. The RNC did not reply to a request from CNBC for comment on the committee. Joint fundraising committees like Trump 47 are allowed to accept nearly $1 million from each individual donor. Biden and the Democrats have a similar joint committee, and in January alone, at least five individuals wrote checks for more than $900,000 each to the effort, dubbed Biden Victory. But outside of longtime allies like veteran investors John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, Trump has not received pledges or contributions from many other wealthy Republicans, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC. Trump's legal money squeeze is not limited to just his lawyers' bills. Over the past three months, the former president has been found liable for fraud and defamation in federal and state civil court cases. The total combined judgments ordered against Trump add up to more than $500 million. On Monday, Trump's attorneys revealed the former president has been unable to secure a $454 million bond he needs to prevent the largest judgment against him from coming due later this month. If Trump can't get a bond, he will need to pay the millions himself. New York Attorney General Letitia James has said she won't hesitate to seize Trump's properties if he fails to pay. There are other Republican donors who might eventually back Trump, however, including Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman and casino executive Miriam Adelson.

New York businessman Stephen Louro told CNBC he plans to host Trump for a fundraiser later this year in the Hamptons. The event will feature Trump and Republican lawmakers who represent Long Island's congressional districts. Louro said he plans to hold a demonstration of a jet suit at his home for guests. But Louro represents a rare commitment among New York's deep ranks of Republican donors. There are very few fundraising events currently scheduled to benefit Trump's campaign in the coming months within the Empire State, a well-known political advisor told CNBC. Trump is also expected to attend the New York Republican Party's annual gala in April, according a person briefed on the matter. That event will feature Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., a longtime Trump ally who could end up being his running mate, according to the invitation. The former president's busy schedule of courtroom appearances could also be holding him back from attending events, said a Republican fundraiser and Trump ally. Trump ""has to be at the event [in order to raise money]. How do you get there if you're in court?"" this person asked. ""The enthusiasm for voting for him is there. Maybe the enthusiasm in terms of giving may not be there.""

Chasing Haley donors

This includes — critically — Republicans who gave money to Trump's toughest primary opponent, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. Earlier this year, Trump threatened to blacklist Haley donors from his campaign. ""Anybody that makes a 'Contribution' to [Haley] from this moment forth, will be permanently barred from the MAGA camp. We don't want them, and will not accept them,"" he wrote on Truth Social Jan. 24. But the threat only made it that much harder for Trump's campaign to recruit former Haley donors to the team, some of whom they spoke to as recently as March 4. So far, few of them have made the leap from Haley's camp to Trump's.

In some cases, they have ruled out Trump altogether, and committed to either helping Biden or to raising money for Republicans locked in tight congressional races instead, sources explained. A former Haley fundraiser told CNBC how an investment banker explained to him that while the person was no fan of Biden's, they may not end up supporting Trump out of concern the former president will say things that could embarrass his wealthy supporters. The previous Haley fundraising advisor also described how the CEO of a major investment advisory firm told him they did not want to give to Trump or the RNC, out of concern that being publicly associated with the former president would be embarrassing. Trump's allies still hope to recruit billionaire investor and former Haley backer Paul Singer, according to people familiar with the matter. Singer gave $5 million to a pro-Haley super PAC in December, according to an FEC filing.

But Singer has yet to decide whether he will support Trump, according to a person familiar with the matter. Members of Singer's donor group, the American Opportunity Alliance, are gathering for dinner in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday to discuss ""the future of conservatism,"" according to a person familiar with the upcoming meeting. There, Singer's allies may discuss whether to start helping Trump with their wallets. It was unclear Monday if Singer planned to attend the dinner.

Diminishing returns

The struggles for Trump's online and overall small-dollar fundraising efforts were clear to some of of his advisors before the Republican National Committee recently met in Houston, according to a party fundraiser. Less than a year ago, on April 4, 2023, Trump raised nearly $4 million online the day he pleaded not guilty to his first indictment in New York, for falsifying business records, according to Politico. At the time, it was Trump's single best online fundraising day of the year. ""The first indictment was huge for everybody,"" this fundraiser explained, referring to Trump's online small-dollar fundraising efforts. But on June 13, when Trump was in court over his handling of classified government records, the former president only raised $1.3 million from just over 35,000 donors.

Here are the companies poised to benefit,"The shipping industry is eyeing the artificial intelligence wave, and self-navigating vessels could be on the horizon. With issues of high fuel rates and a shortage of crew workers willing to spend weeks across transoceanic voyages, many shipbuilding companies are using AI to help develop autonomous navigation ships, or self-driving boats. Worldwide, the autonomous ships market reached $4.13 billion in 2022, and is forecasted to grow to $10.1 billion in 2032, according to Emergen Research . ""There's a lot of interest from shipyards and promoting this not only from a safety perspective, but training, cost reduction and other commercial reasons,"" said Patrick Ryan, global engineering and chief technology officer at the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS). ""Covid had a big impact on the pace of adoption and excitement around autonomy, because it put a lot of stress on seafarers globally as they couldn't get off the vessels in certain ports because of restrictions around Covid,"" he added. Recent self-driving boat technology In June 2022 , Avikus, a HD Hyundai subsidiary, announced that its autonomous navigation system, HiNAS 2.0 (Hyundai Intelligent Navigation Assistant System), successfully enabled a 180,000 square-meter-class ultra-large LNG carrier in completing a transoceanic journey. The ship, known as Prism Courage, started its journey from Freeport located on the Gulf of Mexico, passed through the Panama Canal and arrived at the Boryeong LNG Terminal in Korea. Avikus said this journey marked the first time autonomous navigation successfully enabled a large vessel to complete a trip over 10,000 kilometers. HiNAS 2.0 deployed a level-three autonomous navigation system, meaning that human intervention is only deployed in an emergency situation. The success of the HiNAS 2.0 and Prism Courage journey marked a foray into greater commercialization and implementation of autonomous ship navigation technology. HiNAS 2.0 can be retrofitted onto existing ships, providing a potentially easier point of entry to implement self-navigation technologies. Previously, the Yara Birkeland, the first fully electric and autonomous container ship produced by Yara International ASA, cost $25 million, roughly three times the cost to build an average carrier vessel. It went into commercial operation in the spring of 2022. Yara International said that the autonomous ship provides cost savings of up to 90% by slashing fuel and crew expenses. Although developing self-navigation systems and AI technology for boats presents significant expenses in the short term, such advancements help shipping companies save margins in the long run, according to Carol Schleif, chief investment officer at BMO Family Office. Rudy Negenborn, a professor at Delft University of Technology, noted that the demand of autonomous navigation ships extends beyond oceans to include port areas, waterways and cities. ""Autonomous systems can make better use of the capacity on waterways,"" said Negenborn. ""The total volume which we want to transport is not likely to decrease – autonomous systems can help alleviate congestion and make transport more energy-efficient,"" he added. Preventing attacks and errors While autonomous shipping technology can reduce the number of accidents stemming from human mistakes — Ryan of the ABS estimates incidents at sea driven by human decision-making errors could be as high as 80% — it's unclear whether it can alleviate the chaos caused by shipping attacks , most notably the strikes in the Red Sea. Whether autonomous navigation could've prevented the blockage of the Suez Canal by the Ever Given container ship isn't certain, Ryan added. However, he said the technology aids with safety and better decision-making. ""In a general sense that it can help with safety and even things like reduced carbon emissions,"" Ryan said. ""We can do improved weather routing, we improve navigation. We see some of the commercial reasons that companies are going down the autonomous navigation pathway from is [also] to reduce their carbon footprint."" ""A computer can make more timely, more sophisticated, more accurate decisions,"" he added. The big players The shipping companies at the forefront of autonomous navigation systems and AI are the incumbent large market players, said BMO's Schleif. ""The big recognizable shipping names are the ones that are at the top because they have the cash to be able to invest in [AI],"" said Schleif. These companies also have the data and processing power needed to create models for the technology and sensors, she added. The shipping industry has high barriers to entry because of the large-scale investments needed, as well as aggressive competition from existing companies and brand power associated with reliability. Within the market, numerous Asian and European companies have established themselves at the forefront of the AI movement in shipping. Schleif highlighted AP Moeller-Maersk , which began trialing AI-powered perception software on its container ships to improve situational awareness during journeys. U.S.-based investors can buy shares of the Danish company through American depositary receipts. U.S.-based traders can also gain exposure to Yara International through ADRs. Japan-based Mitsui O.S.K. Lines is also accessible through ADRs. Mitsui O.S.K. had a successful trial of the first fully autonomous ship technology from port to port. The company is aiming for its fully autonomous ship technology to reach full-scale commercialization by 2025. Ryan highlighted Rolls-Royce as another preeminent name in developing autonomous solutions for commercial and government vessels. Shipbuilders aren't the only companies expected to benefit from the AI implementation in ships. Freight companies could get a boost as well, according to Morgan Stanley. ""We have long believed the Freight Transportation space is on the cusp of and ripe for a generational shift driven by disruptive technologies, including autonomous [technologies],"" analyst Ravi Shanker wrote in a note last May. Shanker highlighted J.B. Hunt , C.H. Robinson and Expeditors International as companies engaged in ocean-shipping that will benefit from autonomous operations. ""This is a starting point for industry,"" Negenborn said. ""This is not something that will fade away.""",2/2/2024,2,0.002609586,0.965170205,0.001296195,0.013271368,0.01641643,0.00123608

Hunt,"Earnings season analysis: Technology delivering fat profits, with lots of caution elsewhere","Roughly 111 companies in the S & P 500 had reported fourth quarter earnings through Thursday morning and, so far, it's a mixed picture. Good news: LSEG is reporting Q4 earnings for the S & P 500 are starting to creep up, now estimated to increase 4.8%, from 4.4% two weeks ago. Still, that is a considerable decline from the 11% gain expected several months ago. The declines have come from just about every sector, with the exception of technology, which has seen its earnings estimates rise since October 1. A good example: IBM , which beat earnings expectations and highlighted an uptick in demand for artificial intelligence products and services. Bottom line: the earnings picture supports investors' continued enthusiasm for tech. Outside of technology, earnings expectations are lower than three months ago, but are now rising again. ""Most companies are seeing their estimates lowered, but it is not as bad as three months ago, when the 10-year Treasury was hitting 5% and a 30-year mortgage was at 8%,"" Nick Raich from Earnings Scout said. ""The market has been anticipating improving earnings expectations, and it's getting them. By that I do not mean that earnings estimates are rising, I mean they are not getting cut as much anymore,"" Raich added. Commodity deflation doesn't mean lower prices Everyone knows commodity and packaging costs are coming down, but does that mean that companies will be lowering prices? Not necessarily. Sherwin-Williams acknowledged it was seeing lower input costs, but said higher wages were offsetting that. As a result, prices are going up, not down. CEO Heidi Petz remarked, ""As we look at our entire cost basket, we see modest raw material deflation, though continued escalation of wages and other costs has led us to implement a 5% price increase in Paint Stores Group effective February 1."" Kimberly-Clark said essentially the same thing on its conference call. CFO Nelson Urdaneta pointed out, ""Core commodities like pulp, resin, energy [in] dollar terms are expected to be somewhat favorable following the trends that we saw in the back half of last year…However, if you think of other components of our cost basket like distribution, logistics and labor inflation, that's actually going to remain a headwind in this year in '24, and that's pretty much offsetting the tailwinds that we're seeing on the core commodities."" Meanwhile, shipper J.B. Hunt last week said hefty insurance costs hurt its earnings. Insurance will continue to be a major inflationary concern this year too , with premiums expected to rise ""upwards of 50% to 60%."" CEO John Roberts noted that ""ultimately these inflationary costs get passed on to customers and consumers."" Volume declines pressure revenue A number of companies have been reporting revenue below expectations. Spice maker McCormick reported a 3% decline in volumes and noted ""a pressured consumer exhibiting more value-seeking behavior, which resulted in lower consumption."" Consumer sales in the Americas declined 4%. Procter & Gamble saw a 1% decline in volumes. That overshadowed the 4% rise in prices as revenues were short of estimates. Demand for its health care products was particularly poor, with that segment's volumes dropping 3%. STMicroelectronics also reported very weak Q1 and FY revenue forecasts. Knight-Swift Transportation posted disappointing revenues as freight demand slowed ""meaningfully"" in December. The trucker was also hurt by a double-digit decline in prices within its main Truckload segment. Industrials: very choppy Dow Inc. saw lower volumes and pricing within its industrial intermediates & infrastructure business unit. It pointed out it saw ""lower demand for industrial applications."" CEO Jim Fitterling expects ""softness in industrial and durable goods demand to continue"" in Q1, but is ""encouraged by early positive signals in areas including construction, automotive and consumer electronics."" Tuesday afternoon, Texas Instruments cited ""increasing weakness across"" its industrial business and ""a sequential decline"" in the automotive sector. STMicroelectronics experienced ""further deterioration in industrial [demand]."" And while automotive demand was ""stable,"" it saw a ""softer growth rate."" DuPont saw ""additional channel inventory destocking within our industrial businesses"" along with continued weakness in China. That was a big reason for its Q4 warning and additionally, its poor Q1 guidance. Some weakness clearly due to China Earlier Tuesday, 3M reported lower volumes in its industrial segment and said it expects mixed industrial end-market demand in 2024, with much of the weakness due to China. 3M gets about 11% of revenue from mainland China. Texas Instruments talked about industrial weakness and said it hasn't seen a recovery in China. ASML remained cautious as export restrictions would affect up to 15% of its China sales. Even Procter & Gamble cited China weakness on its analyst call. CFO Andre Schulten remarked, ""Greater China organic sales were down minus 15% versus prior year, underlying market growth was down mid to high-single digits as consumer confidence weakened further."" He added that the recovery there has been ""somewhat bumpy."" Weak first quarter guidance A number of companies provided forward guidance that was below expectations, including FedEx , Humana , Procter & Gamble, Baker Hughes , Conagra , AT & T , Adobe and Dupont. As a result, estimates for the first quarter of 2024 are coming down, now expected to rise 6.2%, well below the 9.6% expected on October 1. Again, most sectors have seen estimates decline, with the exception of Technology, where earnings growth expectations have held steady, at 18.5%. The bottom line on earnings so far: tech is leading, but the short-term trend in other sectors is lower. The market is not expecting that to continue. There are expectations of double-digit gains for 2024 in communications services, industrials, health care and consumer discretionary. The reason: outside of the artificial intelligence story that's driving tech, the macroeconomic outlook is still the main driver. ""It's still goldilocks,"" Raich said.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average registered its worst week since October, falling 0.93%. The S & P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.26% and 1.17%, respectively. Earnings season also continued to wind down on a largely positive note. According to FactSet, 99% of S & P 500 companies have reported results; 73% of companies reported an upside earnings surprise, while 64% reported better-than-expected revenue results. Within the Club, we heard this week from Foot Locker on Wednesday, then from Costco and Broadcom on Thursday. Foot Locker disappointed, though the magnitude of the sell-off in response seemed overdone. Costco and Broadcom delivered quality, but imperfect reports, opening the door for profit-takers to act following sizable runs in both stocks. The big economic data drop of the week arrived Friday with February's nonfarm payrolls report . The jobs report certainly served to support the ""soft landing"" thesis, as more-than-expected job additions were offset partially by a higher-than-anticipated unemployment rate and softer annual wage inflation. That's the right mix for investors who want to see downward pressure on inflation without a spike in unemployment that threatens economic growth. In the days leading up to the main event, we also got a private sector jobs number from payroll processing firm ADP and the February ISM Services report . Both came in slightly weaker than estimates. Meanwhile, the Commerce Department's January factory orders report Tuesday showed a larger-than-expected drop. It is quiet on the Club earnings front in the week ahead, but several key macroeconomic updates will command the stage. The center of attention is Tuesday's February consumer price index report . Economists are looking for a 3.1% annual increase at the headline level and 3.7% annual increase at the core level, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, according to FactSet. While the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation is the core personal consumption expenditures index, the CPI is the next best thing. It certainly factors into Wall Street's thinking about the Fed's next move on interest rates. Aside from the core inflation number, the key watch item within the report is the shelter index. Sticky housing inflation has been a real thorn in the Fed's side, given it is a very large and unavoidable cost for the U.S. consumer. On Thursday, the February producer price index is due out. It doesn't carry as much weight as the CPI report because the Fed's primary concern are what U.S. consumers, not producers, are paying. Still, it's an important report because it may foreshadow trends in future CPI reports. Remember, corporations have two options when it comes to rising input costs: absorb them or pass them along to customers. So, a greater-than-expected rise in the PPI may suggest price hikes in the future as companies look to protect profits by passing on those higher costs. Higher prices for consumers are exactly what we do not want to see because they will require the Fed to stay more aggressive. At the same time, as investors we also don't love the idea of corporations denting their earnings by absorbing the costs. It's a give-and-take situation, but in this moment the ideal outcome is easing inflation for consumers and producers alike. Economists predict the PPI in February rose 0.3% compared with the prior month, according to FactSet. Core PPI, which also excludes food and energy prices, is expected to be up 0.2% month over month. Finally, on a 12-month basis, the PPI is projected to be up 1%, per FactSet. The February retail sales report also is set to be released Thursday. Though this doesn't provide a direct read on inflation, it does provide insight into a major part of gross domestic product and, by extension, the path the U.S. economy is on. Consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. GDP, so if a soft landing – or perhaps even a ""no landing"" – scenario is indeed going to take place amid the Fed's inflation fight, it's crucial that private consumption hangs in, even as the economy slows. Understanding this helps explain why the Fed is right to be so cautious in altering monetary policy; it's an incredible balancing act playing out in real time. Fed Chair Jerome Powell may have been late to raise rates, but fortunately he's been putting on something of a master class in monetary policy since the U.S. central bank began to do so two years ago this month.

He also said it's important to keep an eye on new data scheduled to be released next week that helps measure inflation.

""You need to keep an eye on the consumer and producer price index numbers next week,"" he said. ""But don't forget to follow individual companies, because it seems like earnings season just never ends these days.""

On Monday, Cramer will be waiting for earnings results from Oracle , but warned that the company has previously had two disappointing quarters in a row. Vail Resorts also reports Monday, and Cramer was put off by a ""rare pre-earnings downgrade"" he said is worrisome.

Tuesday brings the consumer price index, as well as a report from sneaker company On Holding , which Cramer has supported for a long time. However, a recent downgrade ahead of the quarter has given him pause, saying even though business has been hot, ""it's fashion and fashion can get non-hot very quickly."" Kohl's also reports Tuesday, and Cramer expressed confidence in CEO Tom Kingsbury, who he said ""worked miracles"" when at the helm of Burlington Stores . Cramer said the stock might be worth speculating on, noting its partnership with popular cosmetics retailer Sephora.

Dollar Tree reports on Wednesday, and Cramer said Wall Street has long favored dollar stores, adding that the company has a ""good a handle on the psyche of the American consumer."" Williams-Sonoma and Lennar also report on Wednesday, and Cramer said he thinks the homebuilder will have a great quarter.

The producer price index will be released Thursday, as well as earnings from Dollar General. Like Dollar Tree, he thinks the company will do well, and it will ""tell a story of price cutting that the analysts will lap up."" Also reporting on Thursday are Dick's Sporting Goods , Ulta Beauty , and Adobe, with Cramer calling the latter the most important quarter of the week. The software company has had a rough patch recently, but Cramer told investors to pay attention to the conference call, as Adobe's suite of products is ""unassailable"" and there could be a buying opportunity.

On Friday, Cramer said he expects contract manufacturer Jabil to report a successful quarter. But by the end of the week, Wall Street will be buzzing about Nvidia 's conference, which is set to take place from March 18 to 21.",3/8/2024,-2,0.003636068,0.981246412,0.001249217,0.011544399,0.0017385,0.00058561

Shares have rallied 77% year to date as investors amp up bets on the chipmaker's dominant artificial intelligence position. This week alone, the semiconductor behemoth has surged 6% even as technology stocks and the major averages head for weekly declines. But Nvidia may be getting ahead of itself after nine-straight weeks of gains, according to this commonly watched metric. Using our stock screener tool, CNBC Pro searched for the most overbought and oversold names on Wall Street based on their 14-day relative strength index, or RSI. Assets with a 14-day RSI greater than 70 are considered overbought, and potentially at risk of a pullback. Here are some of the stocks that made the list: Howmet Aerospace and General Electric are the most overbought stocks, with RSIs exceeding 89. General Electric is up more than 6% this week and added nearly 1% on Friday after JPMorgan upgraded shares to overweight and said it expects the company's outperformance to continue. Nvidia was the fourth-most overbought stock on the list with an RSI reading of about 86. The stock pulled back about 6% during midday trading as semiconductor stocks took a breather. The stock has been a major contributor to 2024's rally, gaining more than $1 trillion in market value year to date. Its appreciation has accounted for about 30% of the S & P 500's aggregate gain this year, according to LSEG data. NVDA 5D mountain Nvidia shares this week Other companies that made the overbought list include Jabil , Leidos Holdings and American Express . There are also three stocks in oversold territory, including Apple . A stock is considered oversold when its RSI is below 30 and could signal a buying opportunity. The iPhone maker, with an RSI of about 26, added roughly 2% on Friday, reversing some of its week-to-date gains after getting hit with a $2 billion fine and suffering a decline in sales in China.

Johnson & Johnson has reached a tentative settlement to resolve an investigation by more than 40 states into claims the company misled patients about the safety of its talc baby powder and other talc-based products, the company said in a statement to CNBC on Tuesday.

Notably, the settlement does not resolve the tens of thousands of consumer lawsuits, some of which are slated to go to trial this year, alleging that those talc-based products caused cancer.

Those cases have for decades caused financial and public relations trouble for J&J, which contends that its talc-based products and now-discontinued talc baby powder are safe for consumers.

J&J said in an October securities filing that 42 states and Washington, D.C., had launched a joint investigation into its marketing of talc-based products. The company will pay $700 million to settle the probe, its CFO Joseph Wolk told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday.

A Republican effort to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas failed Tuesday, after four members of the caucus bucked party leaders and voted against an impeachment resolution in the House.

The failure of the impeachment bill represents a major blow to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who had portrayed the vote to impeach Mayorkas as a key part of House Republicans' broader siege against the Biden administration, over its handling of the Southern border.

The dramatic vote played out over 15 minutes, most of which were spent with the House deadlocked at 215-215.

Republicans could afford to lose only two votes, if all Democrats voted. But it was unclear whether Texas Democratic Rep. Al Green would make it -- Green recently had surgery.

As the vote began, Green was wheeled onto the House floor, where he voted against the impeachment.

With Green's no vote, and three Republican nays from Reps. Tom McClintock (Calif.), Mike Gallagher (Wisc.) and Ken Buck (Colo.), support for the impeachment hit a ceiling of 215, not enough to overcome the 215 no votes.

The standoff finally ended when Rep. Blake Moore (R-Utah) switched his vote from yea to nay, not because he changed his mind, but simply as a procedural motion to end the vote, with a final tally of 216 opposed and 214 in favor.

Several Republicans have already promised to bring the articles of impeachment back to the floor again when they have enough support.

Regardless of what is next, the failure of Tuesday's vote shot a big hole through more than a year's worth of Republican investigations, hearings and threats to impeach Mayorkas over his handling of the border.

They have alleged that Mayorkas intentionally disobeyed federal immigration laws and prevented oversight of the Homeland Security Department. The allegations come after months of record high levels of migrants crossing the U.S. southern border.

If the House had approved the articles, Mayorkas would have been only the second Cabinet member in U.S. history to be impeached, and the first to be impeached while in office.

He could have then faced a trial in the Democrat-controlled Senate, where it was nearly impossible to see a path to the two-thirds majority needed to remove him from his post.

President Joe Biden repeatedly denounced the impeachment effort as a political stunt. On Monday, the president issued a statement in a format usually reserved for executive vetoes.

""Impeaching Secretary Mayorkas would trivialize this solemn constitutional power and invite more partisan abuse of this authority in the future,"" Biden said.

""If the House of Representatives wishes to address these challenges, the Constitution provides an obvious means: passing legislation.""

The president himself is also facing a Republican-led impeachment probe related to his family's business dealings.

While the December House vote to authorize the impeachment probe passed with unanimous Republican support, Tuesday's failed impeachment of Mayorkas could prompt party leaders to think twice about holding another impeachment vote with a razor-thin majority.",2/6/2024,2,0.065496571,0.007311215,0.001096423,0.909472108,0.015682304,0.00094134

Johnson & Johnson on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that narrowly edged out Wall Street's expectations as sales in the company's pharmaceutical and medical devices businesses surged. J&J also provided full-year guidance for 2024, forecasting sales of $87.8 billion to $88.6 billion and adjusted earnings of $10.55 to $10.75 per share. Here's what J&J reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: Earnings per share: $2.29 adjusted vs. $2.28 expected

$2.29 adjusted vs. $2.28 expected Revenue: $21.40 billion vs. $21.01 billion expected Shares of J&J closed more than 1% lower on Tuesday following the results. J&J, whose financial results are considered a bellwether for the broader health sector, booked $21.40 billion in total sales for the final three months of 2023, up 7.3% from the same quarter in 2022. The pharmaceutical giant reported net income of $4.13 billion, or $1.70 per share during the quarter. That compares with net income of $3.23 billion, or $1.22 per share, for the year-ago period. Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings per share were $2.29 for the fourth quarter of 2023. The results come six months after J&J completed its separation from its consumer health unit Kenvue , the company's biggest shake-up in its nearly 140-year history. During an earnings call Tuesday, J&J executives said earnings growth in the first half of the year will benefit from a 191 million share reduction in Kenvue. The third quarter will see a ""partial benefit,"" they added. Meanwhile, J&J is zeroing in on its pharmaceutical and medical devices divisions to drive growth.

Segment results

J&J's medical devices business generated sales of $7.67 billion, up 13.3% from the fourth quarter of 2022. Wall Street was expecting revenue of $7.50 billion, according to StreetAccount. J&J said its acquisition of Abiomed, a cardiovascular medical technology company, in December fueled the year-over-year rise. The company said growth also came from electrophysiological products, which evaluate the heart's electrical system and help doctors understand the cause of abnormal heart rhythms. Wound closure products and devices for orthopedic trauma, or serious injuries of the skeletal or muscular system, contributed, along with contact lenses. J&J is benefiting from a rebound in demand for nonurgent surgeries among older adults, who deferred those procedures during the Covid pandemic. The company expects that high demand to ""follow through"" in 2024, CFO Joseph Wolk said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" Executives added during the company's earnings call that J&J expects the medical devices business to have ""relatively consistent"" operational sales growth throughout the year.

Meanwhile, J&J reported $13.72 billion in pharmaceutical sales, marking 4.2% year-over-year growth. Excluding sales of its unpopular Covid vaccine, the pharmaceutical division raked in $13.68 billion. It was the third quarter without any U.S. sales from J&J's Covid vaccine, which brought in $44 million in international revenue. Wall Street was expecting sales of $13.44 billion for the business segment, according to StreetAccount. The business, also known as ""Innovative Medicine,"" is focused on developing drugs across different disease areas. J&J said growth in the division was driven by sales of Darzalex, a biologic for the treatment of multiple myeloma, along with Erleada, a prostate cancer treatment, and other oncology treatments.

The company's blockbuster drug Stelara, which is used to treat several chronic and potentially disabling conditions such as Crohn's disease, also contributed to growth. J&J began to lose patent protections on Stelara late last year, which opened up the door for cheaper biosimilar competitors to enter the market. But the company has bought itself more time: J&J has signed settlement agreements with Amgen and other drugmakers to delay the launch of some Stelara copycats to 2025. J&J said growth in the pharmaceutical segment was partially offset by a decline in sales of its prostate cancer drug Zytiga and blood cancer drug Imbruvica, which is co-marketed by AbbVie . Both Imbruvica and Stelara will be subject to the first round of Medicare drug price negotiations under the Inflation Reduction Act. J&J expects its pharmaceutical segment to book slightly stronger sales in the first half of the year compared to the second, largely due to the entrance of Stelara biosimilars in Europe in mid-2024, executives said during the earnings call. J&J has said it expects sales in its pharmaceutical unit to grow at a compounded annual rate of 5% to 7% between 2025 and 2030. The company, which plans to launch at least 20 new therapies by 2030, has also said that over 10 of its products had the potential to generate more than $5 billion in peak year sales, including its newer cancer treatments Talvey and Tecvayli.

Markets have been betting that the Fed likely will start lowering its benchmark short-term borrowing rate by May or even as early as March. But that anticipation, as expressed by futures traders, ignores looming risks that could force the Fed and its global central bank counterparts into a less accommodating posture. JPMorgan's investment team said the calculus could be important for investors as stocks and other asset classes look for direction. ""The equity rally of the past couple of months was driven by the emergence of a goldilocks disinflation thesis that would allow central banks to cut rates early and aggressively (ahead of elections),"" JPMorgan chief equity strategist Marko Kolanovic and others said in a client note. ""We believe the disinflation process is likely to slow or stall in 1H24, in part due to the impact of shipping/supply chain disruptions and upside risk for energy prices."" Kolanovic specifically cited the tensions in the Red Sea and the U.S. presidential election as risks to the ongoing disinflationary process that has gotten the Fed closer to its 2% inflation goal. The cautionary tone about policy comes as U.S. stocks break out to new highs . At least some of the enthusiasm has come from hopes that the Fed, European Central Bank and other global policymakers will start cutting rates and continue through the year. To be sure, some of that enthusiasm has waned lately. In recent days, multiple Fed officials have made remarks insisting that they are in no hurry to start cutting rates. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, a voter this year on the Federal Open Market Committee, said he doesn't envision the first decrease happening until the third quarter, while Governor Christopher Waller said policymakers should move ""carefully."" Traders have shifted pricing for the first hike to May, though March remains in play with a 43.5% probability of a cut, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge. For the full year, traders have gone from a strong chance of six cuts to a coin-flip between five and six. A plurality of JPMorgan clients responding to a survey said they expect the first cut to come in June. The timing is not merely a detail but is important because it could reflect the reason why central banks are cutting, Kolanovic said. ""The high March rate cut probabilities presumed a faster disinflation path allowing the Fed to cut for the good reason, which has a positive interpretation for risk markets,"" he wrote. ""Whereas cutting in June or later would mean the inflation and/or growth was stubborn enough to keep us high for long, so if the pace of disinflation slows, this raises the likelihood that the catalyst for rate cutting will eventually be the bad reason, growth risk."" Markets will get a better look at the economic picture later this week. The Commerce Department on Thursday releases its initial estimate of fourth quarter GDP growth, followed a day later by its calculation of the personal consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation measure that's watched closely by the Fed. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed .",1/23/2024,0,0.050047226,0.039852783,0.001640527,0.886397779,0.020981949,0.00107973

The firm said these companies have major upside and should be bought now. CNBC Pro combed through BofA's research to find the most well positioned stocks. They include: Super Micro Computer, Kroger, Burlington, JPMorgan Chase and TJX Companies. Kroger Analyst Robert Ohmes said Kroger is firing on all cylinders even as grocery prices remain high. ""We see support for KR's outlook both near and long-term given growing contributions from alternative profit streams & KR's increased focus on pharmacy,"" he wrote. In addition, Kroger has a burgeoning rewards program to go along with a robust digital presence, according to the analyst. Kroger store openings continue apace and that should lead to further share gains, Ohmes said. Shares of the company are up more than 23% this year. Ohmes recently lifted his price target on the stock to a Wall Street high $70 per share from $65. Burlington Shares of the discount retailer are up 16% this year, but have plenty more room to run, according to analyst Lorraine Hutchinson. She said Burlington ""has outsized sales and margin recovery opportunities"" that are just too attractive to ignore. And like Kroger, share gains are aplenty as new store openings continue coming online. ""Over the next 5 years, the company expects to open 100 net new annually though expects lumpiness year to year,"" she wrote. This in turn should lead to more revenue growth, Hutchinson added. Hutchinson also noted that Burlington has been successful at attractive both high and lower-income earners. The company has pricing power, a robust supply chain in addition to brand names that consumer know and value, the analyst noted. ""Given its turnaround momentum and ongoing favorable off-price retail fundamentals, Burlington is well positioned for outperformance, in our view,"" Hutchinson went on to say. JPMorgan Chase Analyst Ebrahim Poonawala is feeling even more bullish on the banking giant after a meeting with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Poonawala said JPMorgan is firing on all cylinders and cited a slew of positive catalysts. They include robust growth, a top notch balance sheet, and ""strategic optionality."" That leaves the bank with the ""potential for upside surprises"" he added. BofA also said the stock has ""defensibility"" should the economy see a downturn. Shares are up 53% over the last 12 months, and Poonawala thinks it has plenty more room to run.

Super Micro Computer ""Well positioned in a growing AI server market. ...

JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America are all slated to post their fourth-quarter results. UnitedHealth and Delta Airlines numbers are also on deck. Overall, S & P 500 earnings are expected to have grown by 1.3% during the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, according to FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters. That would be the second straight quarter of earnings expansion. However, Butters noted that analysts made ""larger cuts than average"" to earnings per share estimates heading into this reporting period. ""Given concerns in the market about a possible economic slowdown or recession, have analysts lowered EPS estimates more than normal for S & P 500 companies for the fourth quarter?"" Butters wrote Friday. ""The answer is yes."" Take a look at CNBC Pro's breakdown of what's expected from some of this week's key reports. Friday UnitedHealth is set to report earnings before the bell, with a conference call scheduled for 8:45 a.m. ET. Last quarter: UNH posted earnings and revenue that beat analyst expectations. The company also hiked its full-year guidance. This quarter: Analysts polled by LSEG expect UnitedHealth to report double-digit earnings and revenue growth from the year-earlier period. What CNBC is watching: UnitedHealth's stock posted its first annual loss in 15 years in 2023, losing 0.7%, while the S & P 500 soared more than 20%. Can the health insurance giant recover its mojo? The fourth-quarter may hold some clues. Specifically, investors will keep an eye on guidance around Medicare Advantage enrollment. Shares fell on Friday after CVS said it sees membership growing to at least 800,000 this year. That's up from a forecast for 600,000 additional members. What history shows: Bespoke Investment Group data shows UnitedHealth beats earnings expectations 93% of the time. Shares also average a 0.9% gain on earnings day. JPMorgan Chase is set to report earnings before the market opens. A call is also scheduled for 8:30 a.m. ET. Last quarter: JPM topped earnings expectations thanks to higher rates and lower credit costs. This quarter: JPMorgan earnings are expected to have fallen slightly year over year, but revenue is seen as growing by more than 10%, LSEG data shows. What CNBC banks reporter Hugh Son is watching: ""JPMorgan Chase distanced itself from its big bank peers last year, both in share performance and winning the First Republic auction. Investors who wonder if the party can continue will seek guidance on net interest income, expenses and loan losses for 2024."" What history shows: JPMorgan Chase beats earnings estimates 82% of the time, according to Bespoke. The stock has also risen in five straight earnings days. Citigroup is set to report earnings in the premarket. Management is slated to hold a call at noon ET. Last quarter: C posted revenue that beat estimates , boosted by strong growth in the bank's institutional client and personal banking businesses. This quarter: The bank's earnings are forecast to have dropped by more than 15% on a year-over-year basis, according to LSEG. What CNBC banks reporter Hugh Son is watching: ""The greatest scrutiny this quarter falls on Citigroup, which is in the middle of CEO Jane Fraser's corporate overhaul. Management has said it will disclose severance costs and job cuts along with fourth quarter earnings."" What history shows: Citigroup's stock typically struggles on earnings days, losing an average of 0.25%. Shares also fell in the last two earnings days. However, the bank beats earnings expectations 76% of the time, according to Bespoke. Delta Air Lines is set to report earnings before the bell, followed by a call at 10 a.m. ET. Last quarter: DAL reported a nearly 60% year-over-year profit jump , citing a strong summer travel season. This quarter: The airline is expected to report a sharp year-over-year earnings decline but also a 10% revenue increase, per LSEG. What CNBC CNBC airlines reporter Leslie Josephs is watching: ""Delta will be first out of the gate with U.S. airline earnings this quarter and we'll be looking for clues whether 2023's robust demand could continue to grow this year, or whether consumers are spent out after the last holiday season. Delta last month reiterated its earnings and revenue forecasts for the fourth quarter and the industry is coming off of a strong and smooth holiday season, so there might not be many surprises there. But executives will face questions about where costs — and fares cover them — are headed this year. Look for clues on Delta's growth and hiring plans for the spring and summer, when carriers make the bulk of their money and high-revenue international travel picks up."" What history shows: Bespoke data shows Delta beats earnings estimates 68% of the time. However, shares have fallen on the last four earnings days. Bank of America is set to report earnings in the premarket, with a call slated for 11 a.m. ET. Last quarter: BAC earnings beat expectations thanks to strong interest income . This quarter: LSEG data shows analysts see a 21% year-over-year drop in earnings. What CNBC banks reporter Hugh Son is watching: ""For Bank of America, the biggest questions remain its exposure to underwater bonds purchased when interest rates were low. A related question is what to expect from net interest income and expenses this year."" What history shows: Bank of America beats earnings estimates 79% of the time, per Bespoke.

336,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/16/where-to-invest-50000-with-treasury-yields-rising-again.html,KVUE,Kenvue,"Where to invest $50,000 with Treasury yields rising again","2024 kicked off with a surprise move higher in yields, unnerving investors. The 10-year Treasury yield started the new year trading around 3.8% after a steep decline in late 2023. However, the benchmark yield quickly climbed back above 4%, putting pressure on stocks. The S & P 500 snapped a nine-week winning streak when the new year began, along with the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average . The three indexes recovered some ground recently, however, ending last week higher. Against this backdrop, CNBC Pro asked three strategists and money managers how they would allocate $50,000 with yields rising again. Here's what they said. Buy fixed income Komal Sri-Kumar, president of macroeconomic consulting firm Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, thinks it's time for the ""60/40"" portfolio to be phased out. The stalwart investing rule of thumb, long revered by investors, recommends a balanced division of 60% of assets into equities and the remaining 40% into fixed income. But against this kind of macroeconomic backdrop, Sri-Kumar believes investors should allocate across four different asset classes, starting with a 15% allocation into short-term, high-grade fixed income in the form of U.S. Treasury bills. Specifically, he recommended bills with a three- to six-month maturity, which investors can gain exposure to through exchange-traded funds such as the Vanguard Short-Term Treasury ETF (VGSH) or SPDR Portfolio Short Term Treasury ETF (SPTS) . VGSH has an expense ratio of 0.04%, while SPTS charges 0.03% of assets in fees. Both funds are up 0.3% this year. ""If you are in those no-risk, highly liquid investments, you can get your cash in one or two days. For me, keeping a significant amount of money in a bank deposit is a loser,"" Sri-Kumar told CNBC. That's because he expects the banking sector to have an even bigger crisis within the next six months than last March's failures, which could contribute to another liquidity crunch in the system. Sri-Kumar thinks the Federal Reserve is wrong to expect interest rates to come down this year — and says they'll in fact go up. That's why he'd next direct 35% of his portfolio into relative high-grade fixed income investments, such AAA-rated or mortgage-backed securities, along with 10- to 30-year Treasurys. Exchange-traded funds that offer exposure to these assets include the iShares 20 Plus Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) and Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCIT) . TLT charges 0.15% in fees and has sled 2.4% in 2024; VCIT has an expense ratio of just 0.04% and is down 0.1%. The last 50%, Sri-Kumar said, should be divided as 30% into listed equities and 20% into alternative investments. In particular, he underscored global real estate as a good long-term play. High-yield bonds or other areas close to default could also rise after another impeding credit event takes place. ""I would have my powder dry for disasters to come up — for blood to be on the streets in the next few months. In that case, you have cash ready to go into your alternative portfolio,"" he said. For exposure to broader equities, investors could consider funds such as the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) , down less than 0.1% in 2024, or iShares Core S & P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (ITOT) , down nearly 0.2%. Both funds have an expense ratio of 0.03%. VTI YTD mountain VTI chart For alternative assets, investors might look into the iShares Global REIT ETF (REET) or SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF (JNK) .The former charges 0.14% in fees and has slid 0.6% this year, while the latter has a ratio of 0.4% and has added nearly 0.4%. Sri-Kumar added the caveat that within these general guidelines, investors might want to tailor their allocations to their individual preferences, such as their time horizon. Investors should also consider whether they prefer long-term capital appreciation or a more consistent cash revenue stream. Invest in dividend-growing value stocks Newton Investment Management's John Bailer recommended investors solely allocate into value stocks with sustainable and growing dividends. These names currently look extremely inexpensive versus the broader market, the portfolio manager told CNBC. One of the names Bailer favors is JPMorgan Chase , which is down 0.6% this year. The bank's strong and cash-flush balance sheet has benefited it as interest rates have moved higher. But JPMorgan Chase also stands to benefit if interest rates fall, which would reaccelerate their capital markets business through a pickup in M & A and IPO activity. Bailer is also overweight medical device company Medtronic , which has benefited from a post-Covid increase in elective procedures. So far in 2024, shares have gained 6.1%. ""They've really turned around their business, they set expectations very conservatively, and they've been beating their expectations over the last couple of quarters,"" he added. MDT YTD mountain Medtronic stock chart Another name within Bailer's top 10 holdings is materials manufacturer and supplier CRH , which he said will profit from fiscal stimulus directed into infrastructure spending. The firm also trades at a large discount against its peers but has edged 0.7% lower in 2024. Finally, Bailer thinks Northrop Grumman is one of the highest-quality plays in the defense industry, especially as geopolitical tension drives global defense spending higher. ""[Defense companies] are starting to be able to price up a lot of those contracts that are coming to offset a lot of those inflationary supply chain issues that they've seen,"" he said. Shares of Northrop Grumman have added 2.8% this year. Buy defensive growth stocks James Abate, founder and chief investment officer of Centre Asset Management, agreed with Bailer's assessment that equities are the best area right now for investors. Specifically, he recommended defensive, blue-chip, stable-growth stocks that also pay dividends. Abate thinks these assets will be the best to hedge against the market's hefty profit expectations for stocks in 2024, which he said were too high given the currently weak global economic landscape. ""The market is too sanguine on the risks to lower growth,"" he said to CNBC. Instead, Abate believes that cost pressures will lead to a deceleration in margins. ""From that perspective, defensive growth stocks typically have weathered that storm better because they benefit from the benign interest rate environment and have the ability to continue to put up earnings certainty — numbers that are quite stable in their orientation by nature,"" he added. Sector-wise, many of these stocks would fall into health care, consumer staples and utilities, Abate said. Some names he's bullish on include Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson and Colgate-Palmolive . ""The common theme for all three is that each of them has been through a restructuring effort over the past couple of years and are actually undertaking new growth opportunities,"" he said. Specifically, Abate highlighted the efforts of Medtronic CEO Geoff Martha, who has embarked on a ""pretty disciplined growth strategy"" since starting the job in April 2020. By spinning off their kidney dialysis and patient monitoring businesses, the company has restructured to drive margins higher and focus on growth and innovation. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson spun off its consumer health business, Kenvue, providing a good catalyst to allow the company to focus on the higher-growth pharmaceutical business. The stock is up 3.6% this year. JNJ YTD mountain JNJ chart Abate also applauded Colgate's recent restructuring efforts, which have recently begun to lift up the company's profit margins.

Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian said in a Feb. 2 note that some of the money that has shifted into money market funds during the Federal Reserve's rate hiking cycle could start to jump back into stocks now that rates appear to have peaked. Money market fund assets had $6 trillion as of Jan. 31, according to the Investment Company Institute . ""Retirees have shifted assets to cash for income, but an easing cycle could drive them to equity income funds.

Additionally, these dividend stocks could benefit from a market that broadens out after being led by a narrow group of mostly tech stocks over the past year, according to Bank of America. The so-called Magnificent 80 includes stocks from a broad variety of industries, such as KeyCorp , Dow Inc ., AT & T , Ford , Simon Property Group and Merck . These six stocks all have buy ratings from Bank of America and are projected to have dividend yields at least 1% above the cash yield over the next three years. AT & T has the highest current dividend yield of those six stocks, at more than 6%. The stock has also started off 2024 strong, with its share pricing rising more than 5%. On the other side is Merck, which has a current dividend yield of less than 3%. However, Bank of America projects big dividend hikes in the coming years, and the stock is already up 15% in 2024. Merck also announced a deal to acquire part of Elanco Animal Health's portfolio on Monday. MRK YTD mountain Shares of Merck are off to a hot start in 2024. The other four names have seen their stock prices fall this year and carry some sector-specific risks that could outweigh their healthy dividends. KeyCorp's stock has been hurt by persistent concern about regional banks, and Simon Property Group could struggle due to growing concerns about the commercial real estate market. Meanwhile, Ford and other legacy automakers have found tepid demand in their push into electric vehicles. Bank of America isn't alone in being bullish on Ford, however, as Morgan Stanley named the stock a top pick among automakers last week.

338,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/28/top-wall-street-analysts-are-upbeat-about-these-3-dividend-stocks-.html,KEY,KeyCorp,Top Wall Street analysts are upbeat about these 3 dividend stocks,"A KeyBank sign with a market ticker is seen on the facade of the KeyBank Building in Columbus, Ohio.

Investors seeking a steady stream of income in these uncertain times can consider adding some attractive dividend stocks to their portfolios.

The selection of the right dividend stock involves a thorough analysis of the fundamentals of a company and its ability to sustain its dividend payments. Bearing that in mind, investors can follow the recommendations of Wall Street's top analysts to pick dividend stocks that can boost their total returns.

Here are three lucrative dividend stocks, according to Wall Street's top experts on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Brookfield Infrastructure Partners

This week's first dividend stock is Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (BIP), which operates a diversified portfolio of assets across the utilities, transport, midstream and data sectors.

Brookfield made a quarterly distribution of $0.3825 per unit on Dec. 29, 2023, which reflected a 6% year-over-year increase. On an annualized basis, BIP offers a dividend yield of 4.9%.

Earlier this month, BMO Capital analyst Devin Dodge reiterated a buy rating on BIP stock, calling it one of his top ideas for 2024. He raised the price target to $40 from $38 to reflect the impact of moderating long-term interest rates on his valuation methods. He finds BIP's valuation compelling and predicts more than 6% growth in its annual distribution.

The analyst expects BIP to deliver an attractive rise in its funds from operations, as he thinks that key growth drivers could generate a low double-digit increase this year and possibly beyond. In fact, he thinks that there is room for an upside surprise compared to management's outlook of FFO/unit growth of over 12% in the next one to three years.

Dodge also highlighted that Brookfield has a solid pipeline of new investment opportunities that are projected to generate returns above the company's targeted range of 12% to 15%.

""In our view, BIP offers a compelling risk/reward underpinned by double-digit FFO/unit growth, attractive yield, and a robust acquisition pipeline, as well as a potential rerating opportunity,"" he said.

Dodge ranks No. 576 among more than 8,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 70% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 10.1%. (See BIP Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks)

KeyCorp

Next up is regional bank KeyCorp (KEY), which recently announced its results for the fourth quarter of 2023. The bank reported a significant drop in its Q4 earnings due to charges associated a special assessment from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other one-time items.

The bank declared a dividend of $0.205 per share for the first quarter of 2024, payable on March 15. This dividend reflects a yield of 5.6%.

Following the results, RBC Capital analyst Gerard Cassidy noted that excluding one-time charges, KeyCorp's earnings per share exceeded his expectations and the consensus estimate as well. Cassidy reiterated a buy rating on KEY stock and increased the price target to $15 from $13.

The analyst stated that the bank's net interest income guidance has been inconsistent, triggering volatility in the stock. That said, he thinks that as investors' attention shifts to credit quality over the next 12 to 18 months, the bank will impress, due to its conservative management of credit in the past five years.

Cassidy also noted that KeyCorp's capital remained strong in the fourth quarter of 2023, with its estimated common equity tier one ratio of 10%, increasing from 9.8% in Q3 2023 and 9.1% in the comparable quarter of 2022.

""Finally, KEY remains well capitalized, and we expect higher levels of capital return later this year and into 2025,"" the analyst said.

Cassidy holds the 122nd position among more than 8,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 62% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 15.2%. (See KeyCorp Financial Statements on TipRanks)

OneMain Holdings

This week's third dividend stock is OneMain Holdings (OMF), a financial services company that caters to the requirements of non-prime customers who may have limited access to traditional lines of credit. With a quarterly dividend payment of $1 per share, OMF offers an attractive yield exceeding 8%.

Recently, Deutsche Bank analyst Mark DeVries initiated a buy rating on OMF stock with a price target of $68, citing the company's resilient business model.

The analyst thinks that the recent period of elevated inflation was like a ""mini recession"" for OMF's target group of lower income borrowers. This implies that the company has already faced a round of credit deterioration and tighter underwriting. Per the analyst, this positions OneMain for an improving credit backdrop in the second half of 2024.

""While the multiple could get pressured if unemployment drifts higher, we think earnings power should hold up well, as should one of the richer dividend yields available,"" said DeVries.

The analyst highlighted that despite paying out a high dividend yield, OneMain still generates excess cash and is contemplating the purchase of additional smaller companies (tuck-in acquisitions), like the recently announced Foursight Capital deal.

Given that OMF has penetrated the non-prime personal loan space, which has a total addressable market of $100 billion, DeVries thinks that the company's expansion into its newer markets, like credit card (TAM of $550 billion) and auto (TAM of $600 billion), is vital for continued growth.

DeVries ranks No. 149 among more than 8,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 15.9%.

Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are the two major names that are scheduled to report. Their results come after mixed numbers last week from banking rivals JPMorgan Chase , Wells Fargo , Bank of America and Citigroup . Wall Street will also get a look this week at the health of the regional banks, when Cleveland-based KeyCorp and PNC Financial in Pittsburgh release their fourth quarter numbers. Data compiled by The Earnings Scout shows the early reporters have had no trouble beating earnings expectations so far. Of the S & P 500 that have posted results, 97% have topped analysts' bottom-line estimates. However, only 55% have beaten top-line, revenue forecasts. Take a look at CNBC Pro's breakdown of what's expected from some of this week's key reports. Tuesday Goldman Sachs is set to report earnings before the bell, followed by a conference call at 9:30 a.m. ET. Last quarter: GS reported earnings that beat analyst expectations thanks to strong revenue from bond trading . This quarter: Analysts expect Goldman's earnings and revenue rose slightly from the year-earlier period, according to LSEG. What CNBC banking reporter Hugh Son is watching: ""Goldman Sachs is likely to post writedowns on commercial real estate and equity stakes, as well as severance charges tied to layoffs. But what matters is guidance on the advisory pipeline: how much pent up demand for M & A deals do they expect this year?"" What history shows: Goldman exceeds earnings expectations 85% of the time, data from Bespoke Investment Group shows. However, the stock has fallen on three of the last four earnings days, including a 6.4% drop after the bank posted its fourth quarter 2022 results. Morgan Stanley is also set to report earnings in the premarket. Management is slated to hold a call at 8:30 a.m. ET. Last quarter: MS shares were under pressure because of disappointing wealth management revenue . This quarter: Analysts polled by LSEG estimate the bank's profit fell nearly 20% year over year. What CNBC banking reporter Hugh Son is watching: Morgan Stanley is seeing off its lauded CEO James Gorman, and I expect to hear from successor Ted Pick about his vision for the company and guidance for 2024 and beyond. What history shows: Morgan Stanley beats earnings estimates 77% of the time, according to Bespoke. The stock averages almost 1% gain on all earnings days, and it's risen on three of the last four days that earnings have come out. PNC Financial is set to report earnings before the bell. Corporate leadership is scheduled to hold a conference call at 11 a.m. ET. Last quarter: PNC earnings beat analyst expectations, but revenue came up short. This quarter: PNC's earnings are expected to have fallen by more than 15%, per LSEG. What CNBC is watching: PNC is coming into its fourth quarter report from a position of relative strength. The stock lost just 1% in 2023, while the SPDR S & P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) was down 10.7%. JPMorgan has an overweight rating on the bank heading into the report, citing ""1) track record of good de novo growth in higher multiple fee-generating businesses, such as treasury management; 2) robust technology infrastructure and history of good tech-led product development."" What history shows: Bespoke data shows PNC tops earnings expectations 75% of the time. Shares fell more than 2% on Oct. 13 after the bank posted third quarter results. Thursday KeyCorp is set to report earnings before the opening bell, with management scheduled to hold a conference call at 9 a.m. ET. Last quarter: KEY reported earnings and revenue that inched above expectations, but the stock lost more than 1%. This quarter: KeyCorp is expected to report sharp year-over-year declines in earnings and revenue, LSEG data show. What CNBC is watching: KeyCorp is coming off a tough year, after losing more than 17% in 2023 following a crisis that engulfed the entire regional banking sector. Can KeyCorp show signs of a turnaround? Jefferies thinks so, with the firm upgrading the bank to buy from hold earlier this month. ""KEY has the most benefits to its forward NII performance from the maturities of low-yielding UST securities and low rate receive-fixed swaps. This hurt 2022-2023 results, but the burden maxed-out in 3Q23 and will improve from here,"" Jefferies said. What history shows: KeyCorp shares have fallen on four of the last five earnings days, Bespoke data shows. Friday Schlumberger is set to report earnings premarket. A conference call is slated for 9:30 a.m. ET. Last quarter: SLB posted lackluster results relative to Street expectations, sending shares down nearly 3%. This quarter: Analysts are optimistic about Schulmberger's financials, with LSEG data showing estimates of double-digit, year-over-year increases in earnings and revenue. What CNBC is watching: Schlumberger fell more than 2% in 2023, and its struggles have continued in early 2024, with shares down 4%. However, Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read expects the oilfield services provider to recover as the year progresses. ""Steady increases in the International rig count during 2023 position SLB for a stronger start to 2024. Higher offshore rig rates do not directly benefit SLB, but higher rates do incentivize producers to utilize time saving service offerings to reduce non-productive time (NPT). We see this setup as generating favorable tailwinds for SLB in 2024,"" the analyst wrote last month. What history shows: Schlumberger beats earnings expectations 70% of the time, according to Bespoke.

The S & P 500 rose Friday to 4,824.19, slightly above the previous all-time closing high set in January 2022. The move comes after a late-week uptick in tech stocks that helped the broad market index, along with the Nasdaq Composite, recoup its early year-to-date losses. .SPX 1D mountain The S & P 500 is hovering near its best ever close on Friday. Against this backdrop, we used the CNBC Pro screener tool to look for cheap stocks that can outperform during the next bull run.

The bank recently announced a round of layoffs amounting to 10% of its overall workforce, as part of CEO Jane Fraser's new corporate strategy and to help boost the stock price. The announcement followed disappointing fourth-quarter earnings. Shipping company FedEx also made the cut. The stock has posted an impressive 32% gain over the past 12 months, while its forward P/E prices shares are below the broader market at 13.24.

342,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/20/4-most-important-things-were-watching-in-the-stock-market-this-week.html,LHX,L3Harris,The 4 most important things we're watching in the stock market this coming week,"The major averages were all up for the holiday shortened trading week, with the S & P 500 closing at a new all-time high on Friday, beating its last record set in January 2022. The week's biggest winner, however, was the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which gained more than 2%. The Magnificent Seven ( Amazon , Alphabet , Apple , Meta Platforms , Microsoft , Nvidia , Tesla ) led the way, with Nvidia jumping 8.74% for the week, and Apple up 3.03% following a big upgrade by Bank of America. After two consecutive winning weeks, all three averages are in now in the black for 2024. Within the portfolio, we heard from Morgan Stanley , which despite producing better-than-expected results came under pressure as management struck a cautious tone. The bank's wealth management business is not quite matching buy side expectations, even as it beat the sell side consensus estimate. On the macroeconomic front, a hotter-than-expected retail sales number on Wednesday put pressure on stocks as investors were forced to reconsider estimates on how many rate cuts the Federal Reserve might do this year. We are at a weird moment in terms of the data. On the one hand, we don't want to see numbers so strong that it takes the need for rate cuts off the table. On the other, strong data speaks to economic resiliency, which is in turn a great backdrop for business operations. As a result, the investors are looking for data that is strong enough to support sales and earnings growth while keeping unemployment low (good for business fundamentals). But also we want data that shows continued disinflation that allows the Fed room to cut rates (a positive for equity valuations). Fortunately, we'll get useful information in the coming weeks as earnings season ramps up and updated inflation data is released. Housing inflation is proving a tougher nut to crack. This week, we learned that though housing starts and building permits were stronger than expected, single-family housing starts were down 8.6% monthly in December. This isn't great. We really want to see more supply come into the market to provide some relief on shelter costs. Existing home sales came in lower than expected, falling 1% monthly and 6.2% versus the year-ago period to the lowest level since 1995. The combination of a lack of supply and high rates is causing many to simply stay in their homes. Again, this isn't ideal as it supports higher home prices — great if you own, not so good if you're looking to buy. Also not great if you are the Fed trying to break inflation's back, since shelter costs represent a major source of higher prices. Looking to next week, we'll get a several key economic updates and a ramp up of earnings releases. Within the portfolio we'll hear from Procter & Gamble on Tuesday before the opening bell. 1. Personal spending. The big macroeconomic watch item is December personal spending and income report on Friday. With the market still trading largely on interest-rate expectations and much debate around future cuts, this report is key as it contains the important core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. As of Friday, the expectation (per FactSet) is for a 2.9% annual advance, which would represent a nice deceleration from the 3.2% rate in November and represent the first time we've had a 2 handle for the core index since March 2021. We're ultimately aiming for the Fed's target rate of 2%, so the closer that core number gets, the less pressure to hold rates higher for longer. Of course, we also don't want a reading so weak as to spark fears that we're headed for a hard landing. We want that Goldilocks number (again). 2. Gross domestic product. Sure it's backward looking, but the first reading of the fourth quarter 2023 GDP index on Thursday will provide some insight into how the U.S. economy is holding up at the highest level and whether the Fed funds rate is an appropriate level or a bit too tight. 3. Housing data. We'll also get a look at the housing market with the December new home sales report out on Thursday and December pending home sales out on Friday. As has been the case, we're looking for any indication of more supply and a reduction in list prices as shelter remains a key thorn in the Fed's side when it comes to sticky areas of inflation. 4. Earnings: Procter & Gamble's quarterly release on Tuesday will show how organic sales are looking as management works to take full advantage of its pricing power without causing too much of a negative impact on volumes. Possibly working to our advantage is that while the organic growth estimate at the moment is 4.4% (according to FactSet), analysts at Citigroup highlighted this week that their checks indicate that the buy side — the expectations that really matter in terms of the stock's reaction to the print — may be more in the 3% to 4% range. In other words, expectations appear tempered and that's always a positive heading into an earnings release. Weakness in China will also be a watch item, along with the impact of foreign exchange (both in the reported quarter and expectations for the year). Forex was a headwind in the previous quarter. The other key focus is guidance. At the last call with investors, management was forced to reduce the full-year sales outlook. They did reiterate the earnings forecast.

""Investment in Infrastructure remained strong, accounting for 70% of total 2023 investment and notching its second highest annual record, spurred by countercyclical revenue from government customers,"" Space Capital managing partner Chad Anderson wrote in the report.

The firm's fourth-quarter report found that space infrastructure companies brought in $2.6 billion of private investment during the period. That brought the sector to $12.5 billion in total investment for 2023, well above last year's $9.3 billion raised but still below the $15.3 billion brought in during 2021.

Top raises during the fourth quarter included funds announced by space companies Firefly Aerospace, Ursa Major, D-Orbit, Stoke Space and True Anomaly.

The quarterly Space Capital report divides investment in the industry into three technology categories: infrastructure, distribution and application. Infrastructure includes what would be commonly considered as space companies, such as firms that build rockets and satellites.

Space infrastructure companies have been resilient through the recent downturn. But Anderson also highlighted 2023 as ""a year of consolidation,"" with 39 merger and acquisition deals across the sector — such as Viasat's acquisition of Inmarsat and L3Harris' purchase of Aerojet Rocketdyne.

""We expect to see even more in 2024. The prospect of declining interest rates is boosting equity valuations and improving [leveraged buyout] math, making M&A more likely in 2024,"" Anderson told CNBC.

""In 2024 we expect that VCs will be more selective with reserves, letting their low-growth companies run out of cash, in favor of deploying into higher-growth prospects. While we expect to see deal count and volume rebound in the space capital markets, markdowns and write-offs will continue — and this will also lead to more failures and acquisitions,"" Anderson added.",1/16/2024,-2,0.003290045,0.99011445,0.001050632,0.002980641,0.001728542,0.000835798

All times ET. 8:55 a.m.: Wells Fargo sees trouble at the grocery store ""Don't Be Fooled by ACI's Beat,"" Wells Fargo analyst Edward Kelly said, in a research note. Albertson's fiscal third-quarter results on Tuesday topped analysts views, helped by disinflation, but Kelly sees signs in the print that grocery trends are deteriorating. He said that makes for an ""increasingly uncertain 2024."" With the caution signs flashing, Kelly favors overweight-rated Walmart, which he said is ""Set-up for a Solid Q4."" ""We believe share gains in grocery, health & wellness strength, and a reasonable holiday could drive a 3-4% comp in WMT U.S. in Q4 (vs. consensus of 2%), despite deteriorating grocery industry momentum,"" he said. Kelly also expects some upside to consensus EPS estimates, but warns that the discount retailer could provide a ""below consensus"" 2024 forecast given the headwinds in the industry. — Christina Cheddar Berk 8:44 a.m. ET: DoubleVerify advertising technology provider rated new buy at BofA with 32% upside DoubleVerify was initiated as a buy with $47 price target at Bank of America, implying 32% upside.

""In the same way ratings agencies grade corporate debt, DV analyzes the quality of online media -- measuring the rate of unviewable, fraudulent, and brand-objectionable content bought during a digital campaign, thereby helping brands understand the true effectiveness of their ad budgets, and by extension, the reliability of their numerous intermediaries.""

Last year, demand was worse than expected thanks in part to plummeting existing home sales and the shift of consumer spending to services, but the key drivers that weighed on the sector are bottoming or reversing, analyst Seth Bashman wrote in a note to clients. He expects Williams-Sonoma's margins to continue to march higher. ""WSM is our top pick in the space as we see the company poised to benefit from modest top-line growth and several margin tailwinds that should drive y/y $1.00+ in EPS improvement,"" he said.

""We reiterate our OW rating on LLY as we expect Mounjaro/Zepbound launch to drive upward revisions to revenue estimates and drive margin expansion, albeit at a more measured pace in 2024, and the company has the strongest growth profile within our coverage universe,"" wrote analyst Terence Flynn.

That said, the firm's earnings per share estimates remain 3% below consensus in anticipation of greater operating expenditures. ""We see the set up for the stock similar to the company's 2023 guidance outlook - where revenue was slightly ahead of consensus and EPS was below … but investors generally focused on the top-line growth outlook nearer-term,"" Flynn wrote.

Shares rose 1% in the premarket after analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu upgraded the airline to buy from hold, with the firm's $20 price target implying nearly 40% upside from Wednesday's close. ""AAL owns the biggest lever in the group in 2024 to offset cost growth: utilization,"" she wrote. ""Mgmt said as of May there was 2-5pts of mainline oppty in 2024, with the pull-through of efficiencies from pre-2019 investments in its fleet/systems … as AAL finally fully restores 2019 capacity in Q1:24."" Kahyaoglu also views the company's history of cost management as a reason for heightened confidence in its ability to weather a macroeconomic downturn. Over the long run, the firm also views American Airlines as one of the best-situated network carriers given its newer fleet and strong competitive positioning. ""These benefits materialize as the network fully restores in 2024, with utilization of its fleets and pilots helping to offset cost pressures including impending FA and agents labor deals,"" Kahyaoglu wrote. ""With AAL more than 70% complete its $15BB deleveraging goal by 2025, there will be incremental opportunity to deploy cash given minimal capex needs.""

""We see a relatively attractive valuation, cash flow that should be inflecting higher, and an increased focus on shareholder value,"" wrote analyst Seth Seifman. L3Harris shares offer the best upside within the defense space, according to Seifman, with the firm's $240 price target implying 18% upside from Wednesday's close. Despite past execution issues, L3Harris looks better positioned in 2024 and situated to stabilize margins, he added. ""Valuation is a key part of the investment case for LHX and while this argument has not panned out in the past,we think progress on margin and especially cash flow can help,"" Seifman said.

""Despite YUM's impressive arsenal of LT growth drivers, '24 likely features slowing traffic, moderating price gains & less like upside to YUM 8% profit algo,"" wrote analyst Zachary Fadem. ""We model '24E EPS as slightly sub-Street, owing in part toY UM's decision to pause buybacks (for debt paydown)."" While Fadem views Yum as a solid business with high free cash flows, strong brands and a global footprint, he noted that the company's largely accomplished the firm's bullish 2023 thesis bracing for unit growth and accelerating operating margins. ""As we look to '24, we see a year where investors will look to play a little more offense, and considering YUM's decelerating comp profile yet premium valuation, we simply see better places to deploy incremental capital today,"" he wrote. Fadem also trimmed the firm's price target to $135 from $150 a share, implying 4% upside from Wednesday's close. Yum shares rose just 2% in 2023, lagging the broader market. — Samantha Subin 6:36 a.m.: Bank of America hikes Amazon price target, says shares could rally another 20% Upside to retail margins, logistics efficiencies, and a ramp in Prime video should continue boosting Amazon's share price in 2024, according to Bank of America. Given this outlook and higher 2025 estimates, analyst Justin Post hiked his price target on the e-commerce giant to $185 from $168 a share, reflecting 20% upside from Wednesday's close. ""With retail margins still having room for upside and AWS poised to accelerate, we think the stock is attractively positioned into 2024 and, given higher expected exposure to interest rates moves (higher P/E stock with consumer spending exposure), potentially more of a 'risk on' stock than large cap peers Alphabet and Meta,"" he wrote. Along with retail margin upside and a reacceleration in AWS growth as workloads grow and prices normalize, Post expects Amazon to benefit from its artificial intelligence initiatives, including its Trainium chip technology and large language model reportedly under wraps. ""A.I. driven demand should be an increasing tailwind as 2024 progresses, with potential for ""tens of billions of revenues"" longer term,"" he said. Shares have added about 1% this year jumping nearly 81% in 2023. – Samantha Subin 6:09 a.m.: Deutsche Bank downgrades Albemarle, cites pricing uncertainty Deutsche Bank downgraded shares of Albemarle to a hold rating as the firm takes a neutral approach toward the lithium industry. ""We believe a more cautious view over the near-to-medium term is prudent given the uncertainty and volatility in lithium prices,"" wrote analyst Corinne Blanchard. ""While most lithium producers are expecting a rebound in Q2 (post Chinese Lunar New Year), further details into the magnitude of the rebound remain meager, at best."" Given this outlook, Blanchard trimmed the firm's price target by $20 to $135 a share. The new object implies less than 2% upside from Wednesday's close. At the same time, she views the lithium market for Albemarle as adequately supplied through 2026, with uncertainties lingering over the normalization in mid-cycle pricing. ""Over the coming 3-4 years, we now forecast a structural surplus market, reversing the deficit trend we have observed the last couple of years,"" the analyst wrote. Albemarle shares are down nearly 8% in early 2024 after dropping 33.4% last year. — Samantha Subin 5:46 a.m.: Goldman Sachs downgrades Lyft, cites balanced risk-reward Goldman Sachs is moving to the sidelines on Lyft , with the stock up nearly 35% since its last quarterly earnings report in November. Analyst Eric Sheridan downgraded the ridesharing stock to neutral from a buy rating, citing a more balanced risk-reward. To be sure, the firm remains constructive on the company's operating trajectory, anticipating a reacceleration in revenue growth and ride-volume growth in the double digits. ""That said, we see this inflection as already well reflected in Street estimates in 2024 and continue to see execution risks around this trajectory, namely via the potential for contribution margins to see further headwinds in Q4'24 from an increase in insurance costs (reflected at the time of LYFT's annual renewal cycle),"" he wrote. Sheridan also sees threats from a slew of ""topline outcomes"" ahead as Lyft executes against a handful of ""product initiatives aimed at broadening its portfolio and further repositioning its brand."" He also lifted the firm's price target to $15 from $12 a share due to higher long-term profitability expectations, with the adjustment reflecting about 12% upside from Wednesday's close. – Samantha Subin 5:39 a.m.: Barclays upgrades Chewy, says 'dog days are over' The ""dog days are over"" for Chewy following a rough patch in 2023, according to Barclays. Analyst Trevor Young upgraded the e-commerce pet products company to overweight from equal weight, citing expectations for resilient demand and a growth trough in 2024. ""We think growth inflects in F2H24, and we see upside to consensus in FY25, with incremental upside optionality from vet clinics, int'l and ads,"" he wrote in a Thursday note. Shares gained about 4% before the bell. The stock's already lost more than 15% in 2024 and dropped 36.3% in 2023. The bank's fresh price target — adjusted to $30 from $19 — implying more than 50% upside from Wednesday's close. The stock valuation also looks attractive at 15 times 2025 EBITDA, with Young projecting Chewy could post 30% EBITDA growth and upside to consensus over the next few years due to high-margin advertising and the scaling of its vet clinic and insurance segments. While Amazon does pose threats to Chewy as it gains shares in pet categories, Young views the company as relatively insulated from China-based Temu. ""We see categories such as branded consumables, pharmacy, and specialty pet categories as being at low risk from Temu or other foreign e-commerce competitors, as brand loyalty, quality/distribution control requirements, or the niche nature of products make it unlikely for Temu or its merchants to be able to compete in a meaningful way,"" he said. — Samantha Subin 5:39 a.m.: Baird upgrades Salesforce Shares of Salesforce were upgraded to outperform from neutral by Baird, which also raised its price target on the cloud computing giant to $300 from $240. The new forecast implies upside of 13%. ""We underestimated the company's willingness to deliver margins, which drove strong performance last year,"" analyst Rob Oliver wrote. Salesforce shares nearly doubled in 2023 after losing 47.8% in 2022. They were also the best performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. CRM 1Y mountain CRM in past year ""With current valuation ... near historical lows, top-line growth and expectations muted ... we see upside from current levels,"" Oliver said.

This week brought solid gains for the major indexes, with the S&P 500 closing Friday at an all-time high, and Cramer noted that the market continues to climb despite wars across the globe, budget deficits, inflation and tension in the lead-up to a fraught U.S. presidential election.

""Can the market keep this up? Only if we still have plenty of people out there bad-mouthing the market and calling it dangerous and perilous,"" Cramer said. ""That will ensure that we get higher stock prices, as it dawns on investors that the worries are wrong and you can get back in and get bang for your buck in the stock market.""

On Monday, Cramer will be paying attention to reports from United Airlines and Logitech , the latter of which could tell investors whether there is a new PC cycle.

Tuesday is one of the busiest days of the week, with reports from Procter & Gamble , Verizon , 3M , Johnson & Johnson , RTX , Lockheed Martin , D.R. Horton, General Electric and Netflix . Cramer predicted Verizon will do well, but Procter & Gamble may not see a blowout quarter, perhaps creating a buying opportunity. He'll be waiting to hear about an increased defense budget from Lockheed Martin and said D.R. Horton can give investors insight into the spring homebuying season.

Wednesday will brings reports from AT&T , Abbott Laboratories and Tesla . Cramer said he expects AT&T to have a strong quarter, and Tesla will see a number of buyers that will stabilize its stock. Lam Research , IBM and ServiceNow will also report, and he'll be watching to see how the latter two are integrating artificial intelligence into their business.

Union Pacific , Intel and Sherwin-Williams will report on Thursday. Cramer will also be listening to PayPal 's analyst meeting that day, saying he thinks the new CEO might lay out a solid plan for the company.

348,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/28/wall-street-could-see-another-good-quarter-after-strong-start-to-2024.html,LW,Lamb Weston,"Wall Street could be in for another good quarter after an exuberant start to the year, history shows","Wall Street could be in for another solid quarter as stocks have embarked on a strong start to the year. The S & P 500 posted its best first-quarter performance going back to 2019, up 10%, as stocks rode a wave of enthusiasm around the prospect of rate cuts coming later this year, as well as the potential of artificial intelligence to bolster corporate profits. Nvidia , the poster child for the AI rally, is up more than 80% in the first quarter. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) has leapt nearly 30% in the period. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is a stone's throw away from reaching 40,000 for the first time ever. Those gains have many investors deliberating whether the rally can continue in the second quarter, or if stocks are due for some sort of consolidation — even a correction — over that period. Many stocks are triggering overbought signals. Some macroeconomic observers worry the strain on consumers from higher-for-longer interest rates will soon be felt in the economy. Historically speaking, at least, it appears as though the party can continue a while longer. In 10 out of 11 prior instances when the S & P 500 registered a first-quarter gain of 10% or more, the broad market index was higher for the remainder of the year, according to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group. Specifically, in the second quarter, the S & P 500 was higher 9 out of 11 times, averaging a 2.7% gain. ""We've been in the very rare camp a year ago saying there'd be no recession, this is probably a bull market,"" Detrick told CNBC's "" Squawk Box "" on Wednesday. ""We've been in that camp ever since."" Significantly, two occurrences of those 10% first-quarter gains Detrick reviewed took place during election years, with the S & P 500 ending higher on the year. In 1976, the S & P 500 went on to register a 1.5% increase in the second quarter, and a 4.6% jump for the rest of the year. In 2012, the broad market index registered a 3.3% loss in the second quarter, but managed to notch a 1.3% advance for the remainder of the year. Other market strategists reached similar conclusions from the historical data. CFRA Research's Sam Stovall noted the 15 strongest first-quarter returns since World War II have returned 12.5%, on average, while the subsequent second quarters averaged a 3.7% increase. ""I think that gives investors something to feel optimistic about,"" said Stovall, chief investment strategist of CFRA. 'Cool the engines' To be sure, many investors do see some digestion of gains after the recent rally. In fact, given that S & P 500 is already higher on the year by just over 10%, many anticipate that the remainder of the year could get more volatile. This week, Piper Sandler said the S & P 500 is due for a 5% to 10% correction in the coming weeks, and notably dumped Nvidia from its model portfolio, citing extended valuations. The Wall Street firm maintained its year-end S & P 500 target of 5,050, representing a 3.8% slide from Wednesday's close. ""As investors show complacency within the current uptrend and exhibit a Fear-Of-Missing-Out (FOMO), we believe now is the time to be more vigilant and 'Cool The Engines,'"" Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, wrote Wednesday. One bearish strategist expects stocks could plunge in the second or early third quarter as the macroeconomic picture worsens. Brian Nick, senior investment strategist at the Macro Institute, said he's looking for signs of rising pressure on the consumer. Recently cooling housing prices, for example, may be an early sign the market could take a turn for the worse, as home sellers are forced to slash prices to attract buyers, he said. He expects stocks would deteriorate as a result. ""If stocks start to discount a recession, you would typically see a decline in the area of 20%, at least, from these valuations today,"" Nick said. ""And given the significance of the rising rates that we've seen, and the fact they think that's really only started to impact the economy, we are probably looking for something even a bit worse than the typical recession."" ""So, something in that 30% to 35% range would not be at all unexpected, again, based on where valuations are, and based on what we think is the likely severity of the coming slowdown,"" Nick added. A 'too conservative' target But others expect any slide in the second quarter will be a more of a healthy pullback in what is still expected to be an upwardly trending market. Many on Wall Street remain bullish on the overall direction of the market. Oppenheimer's John Stoltzfus, for example, raised his forecast to 5,500 from 5,200, making his target the highest on CNBC's market strategist survey. The 5,500 level represents a roughly 15% pop for 2024. The S & P 500 was last around 5,250. Ayako Yoshioka, senior portfolio consultant at Wealth Enhancement Group, said she anticipates the second quarter will likely be weaker compared to the first, but she maintained the overall trend remains to the upside for equities so long as the Fed lowers rates three times this year. ""It's hard to say that we're going to be up another 10%,"" Yoshioka said. ""I think that would be a little expensive, a lot more expensive, than it is today. And so, I think that might be a tougher ask."" CFRA's Stovall similarly remains bullish on equities. The chief investment strategist has a 5,200 year-end target on the S & P 500, but said that target is subject to review now that the broader index has risen past that level. ""I mean, right now, my full year estimate was for about a 9% increase,"" Stovall said. ""But history says, 'no, I'm actually being too conservative,' and that the gain is probably going to be something closer to 15-plus percent."" Next week will also bring the release of the March jobs report. Economists polled by FactSet anticipate that the U.S. economy added 180,000 jobs last month, a drop from the 275,000 jobs recorded in the prior month. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, is expected to have dipped slightly, to 3.8% from 3.9%. Week ahead calendar All times ET.

We'll look at an options trade that could win if one of the volatile stocks surprises Wall Street. Holidays, birthdays, anniversaries and, less than a month a way, Valentine's Day... when your gift and date for your significant other are revealed, what would you rather hear? ""So predictable."" or ""You're full of surprises!"" We all want to be exciting and remarkable on those special occasions, and maybe some people are able to astonish and delight their partner each and every day, but the truth is the foundations of great long-term partnerships are often stability, loyalty, and consistency. Predictable might not make for the most exciting anniversary, but it might mean you have more of them. This occurred to me as I looked at the earnings calendar and saw that consumer discretionary stock Las Vegas Sands (LVS) reports earnings next week, with options prices implying a move of 5% higher or lower. But also reporting are two of the most well known consumer staples stocks, Procter & Gamble (PG) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL) . Neither of the latter two are implying a move of even 3%. There were few areas hit harder by the Covid lockdowns than consumer discretionary stocks in the travel, lodging and dining industries. Peak to trough, LVS fell 60%, and while the stock has recovered off those lows it remains nearly 35% below it's pre-Covid January 2020 peak. Even sharper than the share price declines were company revenues. Fiscal-year 2019 revenues were $13.7 billion with more than 85% of those revenues coming from Marina Bay Sands in Singapore and the company's five big hotel casinos in Macao. Fiscal year 2020 revenues were $2.94 billion, a nearly 80% year-over-year decline. The most astonishing statistic might be the second quarter of 2019 vs. 2020, where there was a 98% decline. This was not the fault of corporate management or a competitive flaw in their hotels. They, along with many other businesses, were ordered to close. The trade: LVS call spread The company's revenues have recovered meaningfully, but not completely. If ultimately they do recover to prior levels, and if we assume that governments are unlikely to repeat another shutdown, LVS could move meaningfully higher. The purchase of an April $50/$55 call spread could profit from a move higher if we get a nice earnings surprise, but if the stock does little or falls, the trade risks just $1.50 per share (or $150 in total, as each call option represents 100 shares). The trade: Bought April $50 call Sold April $55 call A steadier trade Making a living at the craps table is a stressful life though, and a steady income from another source can provide needed stability. For that, consider the following charts from Procter & Gamble and Colgate Palmolive. Notice that their revenue declines during the Covid shutdowns were almost imperceptible. Gambling and carousing all night aren't advisable during a pandemic, but that doesn't mean you don't have to brush your teeth. These price charts aren't particularly exciting, they're just ""so predictable"", but what is also predictable are their dividends. Both companies dividend yields are 2.5%, and more importantly, those dividends grow very steadily. So feel free to splurge on the trip to Vegas for your anniversary, a quick wedding or a bullish options bet into earnings, but when you get back home 1) brush your teeth and 2) sleep well knowing you also have some steady dividend income.

The fintech firm uses the hour a consumer attempts a transaction as a key data point to help determine whether to approve loans, Linford told CNBC in a recent interview. Other factors include a user's repayment history with Affirm and transaction data from credit bureau Experian.

""Local time of day is a signal that we use in underwriting, and most times of day have the same credit risk,"" Linford said. Between midnight and 4 a.m., however, something changes, he said.

Roughly 10 years ago, I began shifting careers from concert promoter to personal finance journalist. Back then, I thought about taxes exactly once per year — when it was time to file my annual return. Now, as a tax reporter for CNBC, I focus on tax strategy all year, including how retirement contribution decisions may affect long-term plans. It helps that I am one of a handful of working journalists to have earned the certified financial planner designation. Over the years, I've learned tax planning can't happen in a silo because today's decisions often have future consequences. Certain tax moves are ""like a balloon,"" Ashton Lawrence, CFP and director at Mariner Wealth Advisors in Greenville, South Carolina, once told me. ""If you squeeze it at one end, you're going to inflate it somewhere else.""

Here's how I've tackled tax planning in my portfolio, and how my strategy has changed over the past decade.

Pretax vs. Roth retirement contributions

One of the biggest questions from investors is whether to save money into a pretax or after-tax Roth account. While pretax contributions can reduce adjusted gross income, you'll owe regular taxes on withdrawals in retirement. By contrast, there's no upfront tax break for Roth contributions, but the money grows tax-free. Generally, pretax contributions benefit higher earners, while after-tax savings make sense in a lower bracket, experts say. Of course, factors such as matching contributions, each plan's investment options and fees, along with legacy goals, can affect the decision.

Early in my career, I focused on Roth savings, which made sense with lower income and decades until retirement. But it's tough to predict future brackets, so I've shifted to tax diversification across investing accounts. I've prioritized my employer match with pretax and Roth 401(k) deferrals, while also making Roth individual retirement account contributions. I've also funneled extra money into my taxable brokerage account, which incurs capital gains taxes on earnings yearly, but can be tapped before retirement.

There's also a small nest egg in my health savings account, which I added to during my years of self-employment. I've invested the balance and hope to make tax-free withdrawals for medical expenses in retirement.

Tax diversification offers flexibility

The goal is flexibility. With a mix of tax-deferred, tax-free and taxable savings, I'll have different accounts to pull from, depending on my yearly tax situation. JoAnn May, a CFP and certified public accountant at Forest Asset Management in Berwyn, Illinois, told me, ""ideally, it's nice to have clients with all types of accounts"" for different types of assets.

So in 2013, at 28, my husband and I bought our first home: a two-bedroom, 1,496-square-foot house in Charlotte, North Carolina for $101,000. We had a 10-year-mortgage. Having a real estate portfolio became a huge part of my financial identity. I thought it meant I was finally an adult. Over the course of a decade, we bought and sold three properties: our first home, a four-bedroom house, and a two-bedroom condo. I also paid off $300,000 of debt and made my first million. By 2019, I was a proud homeowner with a paid-off mortgage. During the pandemic, however, my goals changed, and I wanted more flexibility. So in 2022, we sold our property and started renting again. Here's why I'm so much happier now and don't regret leaving homeownership behind.

I feel like my space is more manageable

Today, we rent a 1200-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment in Charlotte for $2,553 a month. We used to spend $3,400 on our monthly housing expenses when we lived in our four-bedroom, including $750 every month for maintenance and DIY projects. We also kept $20,000 in an emergency fund for unexpected issues, like when our washing machine flooded our laundry room. Now we outsource maintenance headaches to our property manager. Our emergency fund covers closer to five months instead of three, and we sleep better at night. Since downsizing, I've cut the time I spend on chores in half. And we love living with less clutter after discarding and donating many pieces of clothing and furniture.

I have access to the amenities I want

Living in the suburbs during the pandemic, I felt a little isolated. It made me realize how much I wanted a walkable environment. At my rental, I can easily stroll to restaurants and parks, and I'm a five-minute drive to theaters, museums and galleries. Our building has a rooftop, co-working space and gym, and holds many community events. Before landing on our apartment, we put in a cash offer in a highly competitive market for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom condo — without any of the amenities we wanted. We still didn't get it. Had we moved into that condo, we would've been spending about $1800 more a month just to have access to the same kind of services. I'm glad we didn't settle for something we didn't like as much, just to say we're homeowners.

I can invest more in myself and my future

With our money no longer tied up in real estate, we invested the proceeds of the property sales in more flexible options, like high-yield savings accounts and CDs. The passive income we're getting from those investments now is enough to cover roughly $2,500 worth of monthly expenses. We've been able to focus more on saving for retirement, too. Even maxing out our 401(k), IRA and FSA accounts, we still have money left over for other expenses, like traveling. I'm an entrepreneur and financial educator. Thanks to our new living situation, I can invest more into growing my business and skills, set aside funds for conferences and networking events, and cover fun self-care activities like yoga, stand-up comedy, dance, and acting classes.

By the numbers, Sal Khan does really well for himself. The 31-year-old earns around $212,000 from his day job in tech sales. He started buying real estate in 2022 and now has four investment properties, which net him $8,000 a year with room to grow. He splurges on nice dinners out and makes time for vacations. He also lives at home with his parents in Houston rent-free. It's a financially savvy move, of course, but also means more. Khan was born and raised in Pakistan as the youngest of five kids. His older siblings started moving to the U.S. when he was 9 years old, starting with his oldest brother, who came to the States for college. Soon after, his oldest sister moved to Houston to work as a physician, and by the time Khan was 17, his parents moved to be close to her and help raise their grandchildren. They also started the process of gaining a green card. Khan stayed behind under the care of his grandfather as his other two siblings moved for work and school.

Khan was the last to move to the U.S. in 2013 at 20 years old when his parents sponsored his visa. He earned a finance and economics degree from Ohio State University and worked in the Bay Area for a few years until the pandemic prompted him to move in with his parents in Houston. What started as a temporary solution became a long-term arrangement that's strengthened their bond in meaningful ways. ""I do think my relationship now has been the best with my parents than it has been before,"" Khan tells CNBC Make It. Here's how the arrangement impacts his personal life, his financial goals and his future plans.

Moving in with his parents

Khan was living in the Bay in 2020 when the pandemic hit. His lease ended in August, and while he could work remotely, he figured he'd move in with his parents in Houston to save money and wait out the pandemic. He planned to find his own apartment in the Houston area after a few months, but his parents proposed another idea. Khan recalls his mother saying, ""You can stay as long as you want.""

As the youngest child in the family, and after spending roughly 10 years away from his parents, he saw it as a way to make up for lost time, or ""an opportunity that we could use as a family and really improve our relationship."" His oldest sister and her family also lived in the area, and his second sister and her family have since moved from Chicago to the Houston area. Plus, Khan adds, ""there is a cultural aspect to it where, as a son, it's required that you take care of your parents."" It was an adjustment living with his parents as his roommates and reasserting his independence as a single man in his 20s. But Khan says he and his parents have gotten better at communicating boundaries and expectations.

Khan doesn't pay any specific bills for the household, but covers other miscellaneous expenses, like the family's Costco membership, gas, some medical bills and, in one instance, his father's property taxes. Khan also gives his mom $200 a month as a gift to put toward whatever she chooses. Khan's parents are retired and live off savings from selling their house in Pakistan, which also covered their house in Texas. Khan's mother doesn't drive, so he'll make sure she gets around for her ""great social life."" He also accompanies his father on doctor's appointments. He misses some parts of living in California, like his friends and being able to hit the beach. But those are easy ""sacrifices,"" he says, to improve his financial future and spend more time with his family in Texas.

Dating while living at home

Moving home had a big impact on Khan's dating life. He had his fair share of dates who weren't on the same page about why he chooses to live with his parents. ""It's just one of those things where you just have to find people that understand your situation,"" Khan says. As it turns out, Khan's girlfriend, Nina Nguyen, 29, also lives with her parents for both family and financial reasons. ""She understands it's a cultural thing and we can still be together with someone without actually needing to [share] an apartment or home,"" Khan says. That does mean, however, a lot of their shared time happens outside of their respective homes on dates, out at restaurants or on trips together.

""It's not easy to find someone who's comfortable with me living with my parents,"" he adds. ""There is a social stigma to it. So the fact that she has never even once even asked me to move out, I think that's just being empathetic on her part."" Khan plans to move out of his current home when he has $2 million in assets, which he hopes will happen within the next five years. But that won't be the end of his living arrangement with this parents: Khan hopes to move his parents to his new home, too. ""They have explicitly mentioned that, wherever I go, they want to go with me,"" Khan says. He considers it the ""biggest honor"" to spend time with them and care for them as they get older. Khan says it's also possible his girlfriend will want to continue living with her parents, so he's considering saving up for a house big enough for the couple and both sets of parents to live together.

How he spends his money

Here's how Khan spent his money in December 2023.

$234 Gym membership: $11 Khan's only housing expense each month is to cover the mortgage on one of his properties in the Houston area, which he rents out to his older sister's family for $2,700 a month. It's his most lucrative investment property, netting him $584 each month. Like a lot of people, Khan's December spending was higher than usual because of the holidays. He treated his family and girlfriend to a few nice dinners out and splurged on other entertainment, including a theater performance and cooking classes. He also took a trip to Arizona, which included a flight, car rental and trip to the Grand Canyon. Khan graduated from college in 2016 with over $22,000 in student loans. He took advantage of the federal student loan payment pause during the pandemic and now has roughly $19,000 left. He makes the minimum payments of $234 each month.

Sal Khan says moving to Texas is worth it to be closer to his parents, as well as his two older sisters and their families. Erik Mauck | CNBC Make It

For now, Khan says he'd rather focus on beefing up his investments rather than pay off his student debt, which has a low 4% interest rate. Khan didn't make any savings or investments in the month of December. But in 2023, he stashed roughly 75% of his pay. He currently has around $212,000 in a Robinhood portfolio, $46,000 invested with Wealthfront and $37,000 in retirement savings.

Getting into real estate

Once Khan moved home and began saving the majority of his earnings, his older brother and brother-in-law encouraged him to consider investing in real estate. He bought his first property, a single-family home in a nearby Texas town, in April 2022. Khan paid 20%, or roughly $95,000, for the down payment. He couldn't find a good tenant to rent out the the 5-bedroom, 4-bedroom house. Thankfully, around the same time, one of his sisters was moving with her family from Chicago to the Houston area, and she ended up renting the home.

Since then, Khan has picked up three more properties: a multi-family parking garage and storage facility in Florida, a vacation rental in Arizona and another single-family home in California, where his brother currently lives. Khan nets around $600 a month from all his properties, or nearly $8,000 a year, though he says it will be higher once he finds a new tenant for his California property after his brother moves out. By then, he expects to bring in up to $1,100 a month from his real estate portfolio. The bulk of his savings are earmarked for more down payments on properties, Khan says. However, he wants to keep his portfolio manageable and will likely stick to 10 or fewer properties overall.

Looking ahead

Khan is laser focused on continuing to minimize his living expenses to pour his paychecks into real estate. He hopes that, by sharing his story, he'll dispel the stigma of adults who live in the same household as their parents. For him, the arrangement has strengthened their relationship. Plus, the financial gains propelled him on the path to real estate investing and a more solid monetary future.

Here's where the next moves in the obesity space could come from,"Anti-obesity drugmakers Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have a huge lead on their competition, but given the vast and valuable market, rivals are still eager to join the race. Bank of America analyst Geoff Meacham has been very bullish about the opportunity, which he calls ""unprecedented"" given the prevalence of obesity and the huge interest investors have shown in this category so far. Meacham was among the first to predict the category could hit $100 billion in peak sales, but now many analysts anticipate the market could be even larger . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 42% of U.S. adults have obesity, a costly condition that's associated with other wide array of other medical conditions, including heart disease, stroke and cancer. Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, estimates nearly 800 million people worldwide have obesity. Competition is coming This week, both Zealand Pharma and Viking Therapeutics showed the competition is coming as they reported encouraging progress from their experimental therapies in this broad category, which sent their stocks soaring on the news. Zealand shares popped 35% on Monday after upbeat results for its liver disease treatment survodutide. The treatment, which has a fast-track designation from the Food and Drug Administration, also is being studied for obesity. VKTX YTD mountain Viking shares year to date Then, Viking shares more than doubled in trading on Tuesday, putting the stock on pace to report a more than 300% year-to-date gain, after the company said its GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist VK2735 hit all its primary goals in a phase 2 clinical trial. Patients enrolled in the study lost about 13% of their weight after 13 weeks, which is very competitive with other drugs in this class. Perhaps even more encouraging, there weren't any signs that weight loss was plateauing, and the drug was well-tolerated with few patients discontinuing treatment. At the same time, shares of both Novo and Lilly pulled back in trading on Tuesday. The competition is ""not a problem for Eli Lilly or Novo Nordisk, but it certainly raises the bar for them both,"" Yuri Khodjamirian, chief investment officer at Tema ETFs, said in an interview. The Tema Cardiovascular and Metabolic ETF (HRTS) , which is up 12% year to date, owns Novo, Lilly and Viking. REGN YTD mountain Regeneron shares year to date Cardiovascular and metabolic disease is an area that was long neglected by the larger pharmaceutical companies, but they are paying attention to the new developments, which are ""very exciting,"" Khodjamirian said. What's more, he doesn't think that this will be a winner-take-all situation, so Tema has investments in other early-stage companies working to develop weight loss drugs or taking other approaches to treating obesity. These include Biohaven , a company working on drugs to prevent the muscle loss that can accompany use of GLP-1 drugs, or Regeneron , which is looking into a genetic approach to treating obesity. Mixed success But developing drugs in this space isn't easy. ""[T]hose new entrants have had mixed results as Pfizer's two assets and some smaller players (e.g., Structure Therapeutics and Altimmune ) that underscore the clinical challenges of the space,"" Meacham wrote in a recent research note. ""Regardless, we expect the number of entrants to continue to swell, especially [as] we see progress on access + reimbursement."" But both Structure and Altimmune were trading higher Tuesday on Viking's news. Other companies working in the category and adjacent treatments include Terns Pharmaceuticals and Scholar Rock . AstraZeneca and Roche have jumped into the space by making acquisitions . ALT 6M mountain Altimmune shares over the past six months Jeff Jonas, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, sees other ways investors could benefit from increasing interest in anti-obesity medications. That includes drug distributors like McKesson , who will benefit from the growing volume of sales, and players who participate in the supply chain like Becton Dickinson . He was an investor in contract drug manufacturer Catalent , which will be bought out by Novo Nordisk's parent in a deal that is aimed at boosting Novo's manufacturing capacity. The portfolio manager expects Lilly and Novo have about two more years to enjoy their duopoly in the category before competition intensifies and the current $1,000-plus a month list prices for the GLP-1 drugs ""collapse."" Still early days Some analysts and investors admit it is still very early days for obesity treatment and many questions remain to be answered. For example, patients who take these drugs can see the weight creep back on once they stop taking the drugs. But will these people want to stay on these drugs for life? That's not clear. Especially when one considers that the side effects — which can include nausea, constipation and diarrhea — can force some patients to discontinue use. Next-generation drugs in the pipeline could seek to relieve some of these symptoms — and will likely be rewarded by patients if they can. At the moment, however, it hasn't mattered much when patients halt treatment because the drugs are in such demand that the companies are selling all they can manufacture. BofA's Meacham recently shared IQVIA script data for the week ended Feb. 16 with clients that showed robust growth in GLP-1 prescriptions, up 22% from a year ago. Meacham said he expects GLP-1 drugs accounted for a 31% share of the diabetes market in the first quarter, up from 25% in the first quarter of 2023. He estimated that 14% of the prescriptions for GLP-1 medication are being written for obesity, while 86% are for diabetes. ""We continue to expect above consensus growth in the space, as we are bullish on adoption from payers and broader obesity uptake,"" Meacham wrote. Zepbound, which was approved by the FDA to treat obesity in late 2023, is gaining share quickly, giving Lilly a 46% share of the overall GLP-1 market, according to Meacham. For obesity only, Lilly has already gained a 38% share, despite only being in the market for 13 weeks, he said. And Lilly has the chance to gain even more ground with it grabbing about 47% of all the new prescriptions being written. What's next for Viking As for Viking, some of Tuesday's enormous stock gains are being fueled by speculation that another larger pharmaceutical company, like a Merck or a Pfizer will look to buy it, according to Tema's Khodjamirian. That can often be the playbook in the sector. Khodjamirian noted that manufacturing these drugs is a difficult process, and Viking will need to build a sales force as well to compete against the already established Novo and Lilly. But with the run-up in the stock, it's become a more costly proposition. Gabelli's Jonas said he's skeptical of Pfizer's interest given that they are already busy integrating previous acquisitions and have amassed a good amount of debt. But, he said, the run-up in Viking's stock value could allow it to fund its own growth. Commenting on Viking's stock run-up, William Blair analyst Andy Hsieh said, ""... we are admittedly in uncharted territory regarding the commercial potential of the GLP-1 class, and the public's robust awareness could drive access expansion (specifically, initiation of Medicare reimbursement or growth in company-sponsored healthcare plans)."" Hsieh said a competitor could challenge Lilly and Novo by competing on price. ""We also emphasize that one of the idiosyncrasies of the U.S. healthcare system, which grants pharmacy benefit managers significant power to shape prescription patterns through the creation of formularies, could present an opportunity for non-first-in-class competitors.""",2/27/2024,2,0.003444174,0.684776902,0.004383496,0.284138709,0.017212389,0.006044336

They are group purchasing organizations, which broker drug purchases for hospitals and other health-care providers, and drug wholesalers, which buy medicines from manufacturers and distribute them to providers.

But the Biden administration is zeroing in on other players in the drug supply chain to uncover the ""root causes and potential solutions"" to ongoing shortages.

The move follows an unprecedented shortfall of crucial medicine ranging from injectable cancer therapies to generics, or cheaper versions of brand-name medicines, over the last year, which has forced hospitals and patients to ration drugs. Problems from manufacturing quality control to demand surges can drive supply issues.

The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday said it is examining the role that drug wholesalers and companies that purchase medicines for U.S. health-care providers play in shortages of generic drugs, which account for the majority of Americans' prescriptions.

The request for information will examine whether those middlemen have misused their market power to cut the prices of generic drugs to the point that manufacturers can't profit and have to stop production, and rival suppliers are discouraged from competing in the generic drug market.

""The FTC is interested in looking at this market because on one side of the market, you have patients that are desperate for the right drug and would pay a very high price for that drug if they could. And on the other side of the market, you have manufacturers that can't get more than a few dollars per dose of that same drug,"" Doug Farrar, director of the FTC's Office of Public Affairs, told CNBC.

""So that negative outcome for patients is what caused the FTC to want to study this market,"" he added.

The FTC and HHS did not name specific companies. But Vizient, Premier and HealthTrust are among the biggest group purchasing organizations for hospitals, while Cencora , Cardinal Health and McKesson are responsible for roughly 90% of prescription drug distribution in the U.S..

The public will have 60 days to submit comments at Regulations.gov, the FTC said.

Group purchasing organizations and wholesalers have gotten limited attention on Capitol Hill, even as reining in high drug costs has become a key priority among lawmakers in both chambers.

As part of the effort to cut the cost of medications, lawmakers have sought greater transparency from pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate drug discounts on behalf of insurance companies and other payors, about their business practices.

PBMs contend that manufacturers are responsible for high drug prices, while drugmakers say rebates and fees collected by those middlemen force them to increase list prices for products.

Here's a recap of Tuesday's key moments. U.S. stocks fell Tuesday as Wall Street awaited this week's key inflation data. The March consumer price index, closely watched by the Federal Reserve, is out Wednesday. ""I don't expect today to be anything other than a 'travel day'"" for the market, Jim Cramer said on the second straight session of relatively muted action. ""I know the CPI is going to matter a lot, a great deal,"" Jim said, but not quite as much as Friday's strong jobs report. Thursday, we get the March reading on producer prices. Alphabet surged Tuesday to an all-time high after Google announced a new Arm -based custom artificial intelligence chip ahead of the noon ET keynote address at the company's cloud conference . ""Today is Alphabet day,"" Jim said. ""It's a very significant day for Alphabet."" The news is an upbeat sign for Google's position in the heated AI arms race, as hyperscalers like Amazon , Microsoft and Meta Platforms also make more of their own chips to reduce their reliance on Nvidia. Global personal computer shipments returned to growth in the first quarter, according to data tracker IDC. After two straight years of post-Covid demand declines, the worldwide PC market grew 1.5% year-over-year in the first three months of 2024, IDC reported. This is great news for recently added portfolio name Best Buy . Jim said that PC demand will be accelerated by forthcoming AI-integrated machines, which should mean more sales for the electronics retailer. That's on top of the normal refresh cycle that's underway since people bought PCs during pandemic lockdowns. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long BBY, NVDA, AMZN, MSFT, META, GOOGL.

364,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/14/meta-says-broadcom-ceo-hock-tan-is-joining-board-of-directors-.html,META,Meta Platforms,Meta says Broadcom CEO Hock Tan is joining board of directors,"Meta said Wednesday that Broadcom CEO president Hock Tan and philanthropist and former Enron executive John Arnold are joining the company's board of directors.

Tan has been leading the semiconductor giant since 2006, giving him extensive international experience working in computing infrastructure technology. Meta is investing heavily in developing advanced infrastructure to fuel its growth in artificial intelligence (and artificial general intelligence, or AGI) and its buildout of the metaverse.

""As we focus on building AGI, having directors with deep expertise in silicon and energy infrastructure will help us execute our long term vision,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement.

The technical backgrounds of the incomers contrast with former Meta operating chief Sheryl Sandberg, who recently said she would step down from the company's board. Sandberg joined the company from Google and helped Zuckerberg nurture Facebook from a startup to a digital advertising giant.

""Meta has an incredible role to play in the next-generation of computing as it evolves its platform and apps offerings for the future,"" Tan said in the statement.

Arnold is co-founder Arnold Ventures philanthropy, which is headquartered in Houston. He was also the co-founder and chairman of energy company Grid United and once worked at Enron, where he oversaw ""trading of natural gas derivatives,"" according to the announcement.

Tan and Arnold join a board that includes former PayPal Executive Vice President Peggy Alford, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Dropbox CEO Drew Houston, former U.S. deputy secretary of the treasury Robert M. Kimmitt and DoorDash CEO Tony Xu.

365,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/09/alphabet-next-cloud-event-tuesday-could-justify-further-stock-upside.html,META,Meta Platforms,Alphabet's cloud event Tuesday could justify the stock's recent records and further upside,"Shares of Alphabet are on the verge of a possible breakout ahead of the company's three-day Google Cloud Next conference in Las Vegas, where artificial intelligence will be a major theme. Our focus will be on Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian's keynote around noon ET on Tuesday as we continue to see cloud innovation and AI integration as keys to further upside for the stock, which has certainly tested our patience this year. Google's generative AI large language model (LLM), Gemini, is what we're most interested in because of its importance in Google Cloud's battle with Microsoft 's Azure and Amazon 's AWS — both of which maintain significantly greater market share. Ahead of the keynote, Google announced custom Arm-based chips, following similar efforts from Amazon and Microsoft. It's no secret that Alphabet — among our Super Six mega-caps, which also include Apple , Amazon, Meta Platforms , Microsoft and Nvidia — has been our least favorite. We started 2024 trimming all of them after last year's powerful rally. Shortly after the trade, Alphabet shares ran into a brick wall after some advertising weakness surfaced in fourth-quarter results and was followed by a controversy over Gemini's image generator that caused the company to pull the tool. After bottoming in early March, shares soared to all-time highs on April 1. We made a second Alphabet trim that day in recognition of the run. We kept a smaller position because we know that Alphabet has the financial firepower and talent needed to turn things around. Management just needs to execute. Jim Cramer said on CNBC on Monday, ""I have not been all that optimistic about Google's prospects versus Microsoft versus Amazon."" However, he added that Kurian's keynote will be important. It's kind of a reset. The conference is expected to show that ""Google is not being left behind, not being troubled by Search,"" Jim said. ""This is the moment when the Cloud is growing in both financial and sentiment importance, and I have to believe it's going to move the stock higher."" The timing of the annual event is also interesting. Bank of America said it comes only about 7½ months after last year's gathering. The BofA analysts think it might have to do with management's excitement to share new advancements or even unveil new AI-powered offerings. Other notable speakers at this week's conference include Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora, Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei, senior AI specialist at Ford Yao Ge, and Nvidia's director of generative AI Nik Spirin. (Palo Alto and Ford are also Club stocks.) Many others will be there as well to help support Google's efforts to compete in the cloud or to better leverage the cloud and AI tools to further enhance their own businesses. GOOGL YTD mountain Alphabet YTD With shares hovering near all-time highs, there is certainly a lot riding on this week's event. Many investors have soured on Alphabet, but few have truly counted them out of the AI race. We count ourselves among them. Tuesday will be a big test for the company as management looks to silence the naysayers. Alphabet has dropped the ball to some extent over the past few quarters and must show it's still very much a leader in the AI race. That said, we expect Tuesday's AI conversation to be limited to how it relates to Google Cloud. With the company's Google I/O developer conference, set for May 14, we wouldn't be surprised if some non-cloud AI announcements were being guarded until then. Outside the events, we also want to highlight some positive findings from Oppenheimer, which raised its Alphabet price target to $185 per share from $172 on Sunday. According to an Oppenheimer consumer survey, ""search remains the best at satisfying consumer use cases, with genAI a complement vs. substitute to search."" That's important because a big concern surrounding Alphabet's stock is that generative AI offerings such as ChatGPT from Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Claude from Amazon-backed Anthropic or Google's own Gemini would displace search to some extent. The advertising/monetization model around AI has not been established yet. But we know that Google's bread and butter is contextual ads severed up via search real estate. The Oppenheimer analysts added that their survey suggests that ""contrary to investor fears that genAI could replace search, survey results suggest the use of AI assistants could increase search frequency."" The survey also indicates that if Apple were ordered by regulators to remove Google as the default search engine on its devices, most users would either choose Google if they were provided a list of options or actively go and download the Chrome app to search with Google. If this default status were removed, Alphabet would also save billions of dollars. It's estimated that Google pays $18 billion to Apple each year to be the default search engine. While we're speculating, it remains to be seen if Apple will choose Alphabet as its partner for generative AI implementation as media reports have suggested as a possibility. We would like to hear something on this front at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. While a collaboration between the two could certainly make sense given the vast amount of data Alphabet can deliver thanks to search, Apple, no doubt, does not want to be at the mercy of any company. Apple has been working on its own LLM called (ReALM), which stands for reference resolution as language modeling, and developers argue its smallest models perform comparably to GPT-4 from OpenAI, adding that larger models ""substantially"" outperform GPT-4.

One day after Wednesday's hotter consumer price index sank stocks, the smaller-than-expected rise in the March producer price index reversed early weakness in the market to the upside. How could so many prognosticators be so wrong about consumer inflation, the economic data, the trajectory of Federal Reserve interest rates? Isn't that the real conundrum?

But Nvidia's business is still full steam ahead,"The major force behind this year's AI trade has cooled off in recent weeks. Nvidia shares have essentially traded sideways since CEO Jensen Huang addressed developers at the company's GTC conference nearly three weeks ago. Huang announced a new chip platform, Blackwell, and spent plenty of time talking about new software and services. It advanced Nvidia's efforts to create an ecosystem of software and services around its must-have artificial intelligence hardware — taking a page out of Apple 's playbook. Earlier in the week , we focused on Microsoft , Alphabet , Amazon and Meta Platforms ' (and to some extent Apple's) AI efforts and their stock moves. But we'd be remiss if we didn't look at the lay of the land at Nvidia, which has thus far been the biggest financial winner of the AI wave that's swept Wall Street since late 2022. That's when ChatGPT's viral launch opened investors' eyes to what is possible with generative artificial intelligence, which refers to machines making content in response to user prompts. AI may seem like an overnight success story, but Nvidia and Alphabet's Google have been working on artificial intelligence for decades. ""For three decades we've pursued accelerated computing, with the goal of enabling transformative breakthroughs like deep learning and AI,"" Huang said at GTC. At Alphabet, Google put together a timeline back to 2001 to highlight its AI breakthroughs. A major milestone came 2017 when Google introduced the transformer architecture , on which ChatGPT was built. It is fair to say that without Nvidia the current generative AI wave would not be possible yet. It's been Nvidia's semiconductors that make AI work. As demand for accelerated computing power takes off, and the company works to further build out its services, we think there's more upside to be had in the stock. It's why Jim Cramer put Nvidia in the rarified air of Apple as the only two stocks in the Club portfolio deemed ""own them, don't trade them."" It's no wonder shares have surged nearly 75% year to date after more than tripling in 2023. But the stock, as it's known to do, has hit a bit of a rough patch — completing a three-day slide as of Thursday's close. It's been down in five down sessions in the past seven. NVDA 5Y mountain Nvidia 5 years This year has been a transition from imagining what generative AI could be – a dynamic that's leading the major players to buy as much computing power as they can from the likes of Nvidia – to how the buzzy technology can be monetized. The clearest examples at the moment are Microsoft's Copilot AI assistants and Meta's enhanced advertising tools . The AI hierarchy right now looks something like this: Semiconductors are scooped up by the hyperscale cloud providers — Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud — who then deliver compute to their enterprise customers. We're currently at the beginning of hyperscaler monetization. It's a theme we'll be hearing a lot about on earnings calls in the coming months and years. As these companies ramp up their efforts to sell AI products to their own customers, the next stage will be margin expansion, in which customers can then take those products and leverage them to increase their own profitability. This is a high-level theme investors should be monitoring in the years to come. It won't happen overnight, but it all plays off of AI adoption. The trick is figuring out what part of the adoption curve we are at. Last year, we ran a hypothetical model on how Starbucks could benefit from AI chatbots at its drive-thru windows. We noted then that if four of the 21 employees at company-operated U.S. locations, on average, could be reallocated, the result would be almost 5 percentage points of operating margin expansion or a 27% increase in operating profit. At the time, we knew Wendy's and Jack in the Box were early believers in generative AI at drive-thrus. More recently, McDonald's told Jim the fast-food giant is using chatbots at drive-thrus. That's just one industry. Put another way, look for the benefits of AI adoption to trickle through the economy and profit margins to expand as it does. The companies best able to adopt this new technology are the ones most likely to see the most upside in the years ahead. Adoption starts with Nvidia, which can't churn out chips fast enough as this dynamic emerges. However, Huang and Co. are not standing still as they look to growth markets such as governments around the world. Nvidia's CEO has said that every country must have its own AI infrastructure. To be sure, the U.S. government has put trade rules around chip exports to China , rooted in national security concerns, that have resulted in lower sales for Nvidia in the world's second-largest economy. Even if Nvidia's latest made-for-China chips to comply with regulations are not as well-received in that market, there are still so many other would-be-buyer nations, as well as companies, that can benefit from Nvidia's offerings. Putting it all together, the beautiful thing for investors is we don't need to look for a new investment theme every single time; we just need to monitor the same AI theme and track where the biggest gains are set to be over the next year or so. So, as the benefits of AI trickle through the ""AI supply chain,"" look for the benefits of AI to spread and earnings to grow as a result.

As a current shareholder that has enjoyed a sensational recovery ride in 2023 after a horrendous 2022, I want to cautiously approach these new all-time highs by using an options strategy to create some income and protect my profits. META 1Y mountain Meta, 1-year For clarity, this is not a bearish view on Meta. Meta was my largest 2023 holding in the Essential 40 Stock Fund (ESSIX) portfolio that I manage. In the wake of Meta's best quarter and year ever, I believe the strength of the stock remains intact. Yet, there could be some potential short-term volatility as I envision resistance in the stock price near $500. For the bulls, the data was delicious. Meta said on their earnings call that sales increased to $40.11 billion in Q4, up 25% year-over-year. The company also announced a $50 billion increase in its share-buyback authorization creating an organic stock buyer up here in the $400s. If you are on board that Facebook will enjoy its new record high levels but will possibly take a short-term pause up here, the below call spread should allow you to collect some premium and protect any downward movement in the high-flying stock. The trade This call spread can be established by selling an at-the-money call and using some of the premium collected in writing that call option to define risk by then buying an upside out-of-the-money call. The same expiration will be used for both call options. Technically, Meta is substantially above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages while also currently living in overbought territory with its relative strength indicator reading of 86. (in general, RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30.) The Trade: Sell a call spread on Meta Platforms (META): Sold the regular expiration February ATM $470 call for $16.50 Bought the regular expiration February OTM $500 call for $5.50 The result in the sale of the lower strike call option and the purchase of the higher price call option results in an investor collecting $11, which is $1,100 for each spread sold. As long as the stock settles under $480, an investor makes money on this trade This call spread has a defined risk, limited potential and is typically used to hedge an investor's underlying long exposure to a stock. It can also be utilized simply as an income strategy as the risk is defined and an investor does not necessarily need to own the underlying stock.

369,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/08/street-firm-forecasts-a-surprising-source-of-revenue-upside-for-nvidia.html,META,Meta Platforms,Analyst forecasts a surprising source of revenue upside for chipmaker Nvidia,"Sales of Nvidia 's revamped ""made for China"" artificial intelligence chip may exceed downbeat expectations, according to new Wall Street research — a potentially meaningful development for the top-performing Club stock. Demand for one of Nvidia's China-specific H20 chips is ""much higher than anticipated"" and could generate between $9 billion and $12 billion in incremental revenues this year, analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets said in a note to clients on Sunday. Nvidia's companywide sales for the 12 months ended in January 2025 are currently projected to be nearly $111 billion, according to consensus estimates compiled by FactSet. That implies more than 80% growth from its prior fiscal year . ""We know the China business has fallen off a cliff, so any good news there is a positive surprise,"" the Club's director of portfolio analysis, Jeff Marks, said Monday in reaction to the KeyBanc note. Still, we're not banking on a pickup in China anytime soon, and the company may not need it just yet considering how strong demand for its chips is elsewhere in the world. Other Wall Street analysts in recent weeks offered different views on the state of Nvidia's China-specific AI chips. For example, Wolfe Research said the H20 ""has yet to gain significant traction"" with customers, in a note to clients dated March 22. Shares of Nvidia were lower by about 0.9% Monday, to roughly $872 each. Year to date, the stock is up nearly 76%, the most of any Club holding. Nvidia has been sampling AI chips designed to comply with U.S. government export restrictions to Chinese customers since last fall. But questions had swirled about whether those customers wanted the processors due to their lower computational power compared with top-end chips made available to American tech giants like Microsoft , Amazon and Meta Platforms . In January, The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported that Alibaba and Tencent told Nvidia they intended to order fewer of its throttled-back chips than previously planned. Those original plans were set before the U.S. government in October implemented more strict rules on AI technology exports, which rendered Nvidia's first made-for-China AI chip too powerful. Nvidia went back to the drawing board and developed a revised suite of products, including the H20, that meet Washington's current performance requirements for AI chips and therefore can be shipped without securing a U.S. government license. The Biden administration has said its limits on AI technology exports to China – first enacted in 2022 then toughened in October – are necessary for national security purposes. NVDA 1Y mountain Nvidia's stock performance over the past 12 months. Nvidia has seen its business boom and its stock price soar since late 2022 when the launch of ChatGPT sparked a wave of investment in AI technology. Nvidia is by far the leading maker of AI chips, and fervent demand for its processors in the U.S. and other countries has allowed the company to shake off the recent hit to its China business and grow its total sales at an impressive clip. Nvidia's long-term opportunity in the world's second-largest economy remains uncertain, though, because additional geopolitical obstacles could arise and competition from Chinese companies such as Huawei could grow more pronounced in the coming years. Fostering a domestic chip industry has been a key priority for Chinese President Xi Jinping. Chinese customers historically contributed between 20% and 25% of Nvidia's data center business, the company has said. But in the three months that ended in January, that dropped to a mid-single-digit percentage of Nvidia's $18.4 billion data center revenue due to the latest export controls taking effect, management said on its February earnings call . Nvidia said it expected China's contribution to data center sales to be in a similar range in the current quarter, which ends in a few weeks. ""After that, hopefully, we can go compete for our business and do our best. And we'll see how it turns out,"" CEO Jensen Huang said at the time. Based on its quarterly supply chain checks, KeyBanc said it may turn out better than expected due to a ""significant increase"" in demand for the H20. The firm previously estimated orders for the chips to be between 150,000 and 200,000 in 2024. Now, KeyBanc revised its forecast higher to between 600,000 and 800,000, analysts said, leading to the projections for $9 billion to $12 billion in additional revenues this year. On Sunday, KeyBanc raised its price target on Nvidia to $1,200 per share from $1,100, citing what it sees as stronger-than-expected H20 demand and robust interest for Nvidia's recently announced GB200 server systems. The product, which uses the Blackwell architecture and incorporates multiple kinds of processors for AI computing, was unveiled at Nvidia's anticipated GTC conference last month. In explaining its price-target bump, KeyBanc also pointed to Nvidia's plans around production capacity with its chipmaking partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, as a sign AI-linked revenues will grow again next year.

370,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/07/goldman-sachs-alphabet-amazon-could-issue-dividends-after-meta.html,META,Meta Platforms,Wall Street thinks these 2 tech giants could be next to issue dividends after Meta,"Following last week's surprise Meta Platforms dividend announcement, Goldman Sachs analysts identified 15 companies that could be next. Their list includes the two final names in our Significant Six mega-caps that don't already offer dividends. Goldman's jumping-off point happened last Thursday evening when Meta declared its first-ever dividend — a 50-cent-per-share quarterly payout. Coupled with a knockout fourth quarter, the Club stock soared more than 20% on Friday — adding a single-session record $205 billion in market value. Not surprisingly, Meta shares came off the boil on Monday and Tuesday. They resumed their climb on Wednesday. According to Goldman analysts' models, Alphabet ranked No. 1 and Amazon ranked No. 8 on their list as companies that have ""historically suggested a relatively high propensity to initiate a dividend."" They said some of the characteristics of a company likely to initiate a dividend include, big in size, stable earnings, high profit margins, and reasonable valuations. Both Alphabet and Amazon fit the bill and are part of Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust , the portfolio used for the CNBC Investing Club. Goldman said, ""On average, share prices react positively to dividend initiations and increases."" Meta's run last Thursday proved that point. The analysts added that dividend issuance could suggest strength in a company's future earnings growth prospects, and therefore ""widen a company's pool of potential shareholders to include income-oriented investors."" Companies with dividends pay them out to shareholders quarterly — providing an incentive to own the stock because they boost investor returns. The Club seeks out dividend-paying stocks since we like to get paid to hold pieces of companies that we believe in. We encourage investors to reinvest their dividends. However, we do not – and instead, give the payouts and all realized annual net gains from the Trust portfolio to charity, as is our mission. According to Goldman's conversations with management teams, companies are trying to figure out how best to give extra cash to shareholders in the current macro environment. In addition to dividends, companies also use cash to buy back their stocks. Some companies do both. Some do either one. Some do neither dividends nor buybacks. Paying a dividend depends on the fundamentals of a company and a whole host of factors. But typically, companies in high-growth sectors including tech, historically have not decided to pay dividends because they require a lot of investment to grow their businesses. Instead, they've preferred buybacks — which don't come with the same long-term commitment as a declared dividend. Like Alphabet and Amazon, they don't have dividends but regularly repurchase their stocks, which lowers share counts and makes each investor's ownership in the company greater, even if they don't buy any more stock. As the big tech companies mature, they are increasingly offering dividends and periodic buybacks. So, the four Significant Six companies doing both are, as mentioned, Meta, as well as Apple , Microsoft and Nvidia . We would certainly like to see Alphabet and Amazon become dividend-payers. Only time will tell. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long META, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, AAPL, MSFT. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

For many years, Conemaugh Health System, a hospital chain in west central Pennsylvania, was a nonprofit entity, serving patients in the small communities of Johnstown, Hastings, Meyersdale and Roaring Spring. Today, it is a for-profit system owned in part by Apollo Global Management, one of the largest private-equity firms in the United States.

Since that ownership change in 2018, involving a hospital chain known as LifePoint Health, care at the health system has declined, three patients say. One is Paul Ricci, 53, who works at group homes for the intellectually disabled and in his spare time edits the Johnstown-based Allegheny Independent Media, ""a non-fluff website for news and analysis of the Allegheny Region of Pennsylvania,"" as he calls it. Recently, he said, he and his father have experienced overnight waits in the emergency department and have had trouble getting through to someone who can answer billing questions.

That a big, New York City-based private-equity firm had stepped in at Conemaugh wasn't well-known when it happened, he told NBC News. ""The same people were there at the hospital,"" he said. ""I didn't know the care would be different.""

Like many U.S. consumers, Ricci is beginning to learn about the impact that private-equity firms like Apollo can have on health care. Over the past decade, these firms have spent $1 trillion taking over health care companies across the nation, typically loading them with debt and hoping to sell them at a gain in three to five years. Critics say the drive to profit from the acquisitions of nursing homes, hospitals, physician practices and health care staffing companies conflicts with diligent patient care, and the firms and their purchases are coming under heightened scrutiny from legislators, anti-trust enforcers and patients.

LifePoint Health, for example, is one of the subjects of two Senate inquiries focused on whether financial deals like the company's may be harming patients. Apollo and LifePoint have said they welcome the scrutiny. Conemaugh did not respond to an email seeking comment.

In recent years, private-equity firms have taken over broad swaths of the nation's economy, extending well beyond health care. These purchases have involved supermarkets, child care, senior living centers, fast food operations, rental housing and pet care providers. Consumers are often unaware that private-equity firms own the companies they patronize because the firms don't put their names on the nursing homes, hospitals, veterinary practices and apartment buildings they own.

But these firms' involvement in different industries can be extensive — for example, NBC News recently estimated that 40% of the nation's emergency departments were operated by staffing companies owned by private-equity firms. And by 2030, according to a recent MetLife estimate, companies backed by private equity may own 40% of the nation's single-family homes, purchases that in many regions have already driven up housing costs for local renters, academics say.

New research by Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit group that advocates for more transparency and regulation of the industry, aims to help consumers, legislators and regulators identify where private-equity firms dominate in four key economic areas: health care, housing, jobs and pensions. The analysis, called the Private Equity State Risk Index, details private equity's involvement in those arenas in all 50 states.

Arizona and Georgia, for example, rank high on the list for housing risks related to heavy private-equity purchases of rental homes; New Mexico and West Virginia place high for health care operations dominated by the financiers. Alabama and Massachusetts have an elevated impact on workers and jobs while Washington state, Louisiana and Michigan rank high in pension risk because of investments in private equity, the research states.

The index shows ""the private equity threats in our own backyard and gives state leaders the tools to protect the people they serve,"" said Chris Noble, policy director at Private Equity Stakeholder Project. ""By providing transparent data on the risks associated with private equity investments, we empower communities, working families, and policymakers to advocate for change and protect their states from the threats posed by unchecked private equity firms.""",4/9/2024,-1,0.087966062,0.090704866,0.005424981,0.786524355,0.026801748,0.002577957

Here's what the latest Blackwell chips could mean for key players and industry competitors according to Wall Street. Semiconductor derivative plays Nvidia's latest announcements could pose some major tailwinds for companies operating within the chipmaker's ecosystem. Blackwell's higher bandwidth memory needs, for example, could prove a major boon for dynamic random access memory chipmakers such as Micron Technology , according to Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann and Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari. ""DRAM density continues to lift with the B100 and B200 each including 192 GB of [high bandwidth memory] (up from the H100's 80 GB),"" said Wedbush's Matt Bryson in a Tuesday note. ""Again we see this increase as positive for DRAM vendors (in light of premium pricing and margins for HBM) as well as the broader memory complex.""

Citi's Laura Chen reiterated the firm's constructive view on the company following the keynote, noting that its close ties to Nvidia in chip design and advanced node manufacturing could more than double the company's AI revenues in 2024. Wall Street also views Marvell Technology as a potential big winner from data center AI growth, with Bank of America anticipating an opportunity for the company in optical transceivers. ""We believe MRVL's growth story remains unchanged and should benefit from the ongoing transition to 800 [gigabits per second],"" wrote Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer. The stock sank more than 4% during Tuesday's session but has added more than 6% this year. Liquid cooling The liquid cooling industry may also benefit as Nvidia harnesses the technology to cool the 72 Blackwell graphics processing units in its new server rack system, known as GB200 NVL72. One potential winner on that front is red-hot AI stock Super Micro Computer , up more than 829% over the past year, according to Mosesmann. VRT 1Y mountain Vertiv shares over the last year Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani also highlighted Vertiv as a potential liquid cooling winner, calling the company the ""best positioned"" to prosper off AI growth due in part to its large-scale, hyperscale-driven contracts and dominant position within power and thermal management. ""We believe built-in liquid cooling capabilities in addition to the power density of the system should be a positive for VRT's liquid cooling and power management businesses,"" he wrote. Vertiv shares have rallied about 53% this year and 459% over the past year. Headwinds to competitors Not every company is poised to benefit from Nvidia's Blackwell chips and their growth potential.

Shares slipped less than 1% before the bell. Here are some of the takeaways from the biggest Wall Street shops following the event. Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs' Toshiya Hari joined a handful of analysts turning more bullish on the chipmaker following the keynote event, boosting the firm's price target to $1,000 from $875. The new target represents 13% upside. Underpinning Hari's price hike is a ""renewed appreciation"" for the company's innovative capacity and range of customer relationships. He also highlighted Nvidia's ""compelling position"" as a ""key enabler"" in AI growth. Nvidia's latest announcements could prove a major boon for the AI darling, but Hari does anticipate some potential headwinds for competitors. ""While our expectation is for spending on traditional servers to recover, albeit modestly, in 2H24/2025, we envision the ongoing shift in data center spend away from general-purpose to accelerated computing continuing to weigh on Intel's fundamentals relative to Nvidia."" The fast pace of innovation at Nvidia also means that Advanced Micro Devices may need to aggressively amp up its pace to ""keep up."" Blackwell's heightened memory needs could also bode well for the dynamic random access memory market and companies such as Micron Technology , he added. Wells Fargo Wells Fargo analyst Aaron Rakers said Nvidia didn't shock investors with any unexpected updates, but he still raised his price target to $970 from $840. ""While NVDA once again highlighted its full stack / platform differentiation, we think some may have anticipated a bit more out of the Blackwell B200 launch,"" he wrote. The event reaffirmed the firm's ""long-standing positive thesis"" in the company's offering and future monetization opportunities. Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley's Joseph Moore called the keynote ""impressive,"" viewing Nvidia's Blackwell architecture as a sign of the company's ongoing dominance on the AI front. ""While there were no big surprises, the performance of the Blackwell family will raise the bar yet again, with aggressive claims on the rack scale product,"" he wrote. ""The company also continues to push forward in services, omniverse, and robotics."" The performance claims for the Blackwell may take time for Wall Street to evaluate, but leaves them in a ""very strong position"" should they prove successful, Moore said. JPMorgan The Blackwell architecture not only solidifies the company's dominance, but also indicates that Nvidia ""remains 1-2 steps ahead of its competitors,"" according to JPMorgan's Harlan Sur. The company's software and ecosystem expansion also helps fast track AI adopts while creating ""high barriers to entry."" ""With leading silicon (GPU/DPU/CPU), hardware/software platforms, and a strong ecosystem, NVIDIA is well positioned to continue to benefit from major secular trends in AI, high-performance computing, gaming, and autonomous vehicles, in our view,"" he wrote. Sur retained his overweight rating and $850 price target. Bank of America Huang's keynote address offered a lot of ""sizzle and substance,"" according to Bank of America's Vivek Arya. ""One big step for training, one giant leap for inference,"" he wrote. ""With Blackwell, NVDA should not only cement its lead in [large language model] training, but also significantly step forward in AI inference."" The analyst retained his $1,100 price target and buy rating, citing the company's ongoing leadership within the AI value chain. Bernstein The hottest pop music star may want to keep her eyes open after Nvidia's event, according to Bernstein's Stacy Rasgon. ""Move over Taylor Swift, you're not the only one that can sell out a stadium as Jensen presented his GTC keynote to a packed crowd at the SAP Center in San Jose,"" he wrote in a Tuesday note. Even after the stock's blowout run, shares continue to offer upside. The analyst retained his outperform rating and $1,000 price target, calling the company's ongoing expansion beyond chips ""unmatched.""",3/19/2024,1,0.003391578,0.94517833,0.001434114,0.038252573,0.010016799,0.001726498

Microsoft already has a Copilot for general-purpose industrial use in Office applications, and it has released Copilots designed for sales and customer-service workers.

The typical company comprises a variety of groups in which employees perform specialized work. ""We want every one of the departments to be enabled and enriched with a Copilot,"" Charles Lamanna, a Microsoft corporate vice president, said in an interview with CNBC in San Francisco on Wednesday.

Many business software providers, including HubSpot and Salesforce , have been working to supercharge existing products with generative artificial intelligence, in the hope of making clients more efficient. The craze began after startup OpenAI in 2022 launched the ChatGPT chatbot, which can spit out natural-sounding text or other content with a few words of human input.

Microsoft on Thursday announced that it will release a Copilot chatbot that can perform key tasks for people working in finance. The software company will first offer the tool in public preview. Pricing details will follow.

The Copilot for finance will initially run a variance analysis, reconcile data in Excel and speed up the collections process in Outlook. The software can draw on information stored in SAP and in Microsoft Dynamics 365. Additional features will come to the finance Copilot later this year, Lamanna said.

The Japanese advertising agency Dentsu will use the Copilot for finance tasks, Lamanna said.

Microsoft said its finance department provided input into the development of the new Copilot and that it's seen some early benefits from using it.

Comparing data taken from different systems is ""something every finance team on the planet does a lot of,"" said Cory Hrncirik, modern finance lead in Microsoft's office of the chief financial officer. A couple of thousand people on a financial planning and analysis team each spend one or two hours doing reconciliation each week, and with the new Copilot, that takes more like 10 or 20 minutes per week, he said.

The idea is to help these employees spend fewer hours on tedious tasks and provide time for more engaging work that can contribute more to the company. But Microsoft's finance employees aren't required to use the new Copilot, Hrncirik said.

If many finance professionals in a given company take advantage of those automations, though, the company might be able to close its books more quickly.

""That is one of the big pitches for CFOs,"" Lamanna said.

Analyst Raimo Lenschow reiterated his overweight rating and $475 price target on the maker of the Windows operating system, citing optimism around the ad business. His price target implies shares can rally about another 17%. ""We believe Microsoft's advertising business deserves greater attention as of late,"" Lenschow told clients in a Wednesday research report. ""The company has revamped its search offering with new generative AI features, and the ongoing antitrust case pertaining to Google's dominance in search has stirred conversation around a potentially greater opportunity for Microsoft to compete."" Microsoft can be a long-term challenger to existing advertising giants in the technology sector, Lenschow said. Specifically, he said there's a $30 billion opportunity, primarily driven by Microsoft's LinkedIn and Bing divisions. Beyond that, he said another $20 billion could get added to the top line if Microsoft improves distribution. The Redmond, Washington-based company's search offerings can be helped by regulatory moves, Lenschow said. Google may take a hit if forced to change practices following a Department of Justice suit. The Digital Markets Act in the European Union could also help Microsoft win market share, he added. They would come on top of product improvements such as the implementation of artificial intelligence-powered image generation into Bing that should already attract more costumers, he said. Lenschow also said Microsoft has quietly become the largest business-to-business advertising player, raking in more than $5 billion in revenue from the space in the 2022 calendar year.

Microsoft on Monday announced a new partnership with French start-up Mistral AI – Europe's answer to ChatGPT maker OpenAI — as the U.S. tech giant seeks to expand its footprint in the fast-evolving artificial intelligence industry. Microsoft said in a statement that it was investing in the 2 billion euro ($2.1 billion), 10-month-old business to help it unlock ""new commercial opportunities"" and expand to global markets. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed Tuesday that it was investing 15 million euros, which would convert into equity in Mistral's next funding round. Under the deal, Mistral's large language models (LLM) — the technology behind generative AI products — will be available on Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform, becoming only the second company to host its LLM on the platform after OpenAI. It will also see Microsoft bolster the start-up's access to new customers as it rolls out its ChatGPT-style multilingual conversational assistant ""Le Chat,"" or ""the cat.""

384,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/15/microsoft-will-bring-four-xbox-games-to-other-companies-consoles.html,MSFT,Microsoft,Microsoft will bring four Xbox games to other companies' consoles,"Phil Spencer, CEO of gaming at Microsoft, speaks during the company's Xbox event ahead of the E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles on June 10, 2018.

Microsoft said on Thursday that it will release four of its video games on competing consoles.

Phil Spencer, head of Microsoft's gaming division, said in a company video that the decision is ""not a change to our kind of fundamental exclusive strategy.""

Nevertheless, the shift signals a willingness to generate more revenue from content that previously could only be played on Microsoft's own gaming hardware.

Microsoft completed the acquisition of prominent video game publisher Activision Blizzard for over $75 billion in October. In the fiscal second quarter, 11% of revenue flowing into Microsoft, the world's most valuable public company, was tied to gaming. The Game Pass service that provides access to multiple games now has 34 million subscribers, up from 25 million two years ago, the company said. But the Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, which became available in 2020, have not proven as popular as the Sony PlayStation 5 or the Nintendo Switch.

""We think this is an interesting point in time for us to use what some of the other platforms have right now to help grow our franchises, so we're going to do that,"" Spencer said in the video.

Microsoft declined to identify the titles in question, but Spencer said they won't be Starfield, a long-awaited game that came out in September, or the forthcoming Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.

Spencer did say two of the four are ""community-driven games,"" while the other two are smaller titles that weren't meant to be exclusive to Microsoft's own systems.

The Verge reported last week that Microsoft was looking into releasing the Indiana Jones game, previously announced for Xbox and Windows, on Sony's PlayStation 5 in addition to Microsoft's own console and PC operating system. The title will come from Bethesda Softworks, a subsidiary of ZeniMax Media, which Microsoft acquired for $8 billion in 2021.

Many Xbox fans expressed frustration on social media, speculating that Microsoft will give up trying to keep exclusive games on its console in the future. Without special content that can't be played elsewhere, some argued, there would be less of a reason to keep investing in Xbox hardware and software.

One day after the Verge article was published, Spencer wrote in a post on X, ""We're listening and we hear you. We've been planning a business update event for next week, where we look forward to sharing more details with you about our vision for the future of Xbox. Stay tuned.""

Earlier this week, The Verge reported that games such as Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment and Sea of Thieves would be coming to non-Microsoft consoles.

""I do have a fundamental belief that over the next five or 10 years, exclusive games, the games that are exclusive to one piece of hardware, are going to be a smaller and smaller part of the game industry,"" Spencer said during the video appearance.

Apple's iMessage messaging service and Microsoft's Bing and Edge search browsers should not be designated as ""gatekeepers"" under the European Union's strict digital competition laws, the European Commission said Tuesday.

It has now closed an investigation looking into the concern.

The decision is a win for Apple, whose iMessage service has long faced complaints from Android users due to incompatibilities.

It means that Apple will not be required to open up the messaging infrastructure of its service to alternative producers from Android device makers, to Meta's WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger apps, or to encrypted messaging apps Signal and Telegram.

Users have long bemoaned the fact that Apple shows messages from non-Apple users as green bubbles, as opposed to messages from fellow iMessage users which display in blue. Currently, only users of iPhones and other Apple devices, such as iPads, can utilize iMessage.

The EU's competition restrictions also won't apply to Microsoft's Bing and Edge browsers, as well as the Redmond tech giant's online advertising service, Microsoft Advertising.

An Apple spokesperson told CNBC the company was pleased with the Commission's decision.

""IMessage is a great service that Apple users love because it provides an easy way to communicate with friends and family while offering industry-leading privacy and security protection,"" Apple's spokesperson told CNBC.

""Consumers today have access to a wide variety of messaging apps, and often use many at once, which reflects how easy it is to switch between them.""

Microsoft welcomed the Commission's decision and said that Bing, Edge, and Microsoft Advertising should be considered ""challengers in the market"" rather than incumbents.

""We will continue to engage with the Commission and industry at large to ensure Microsoft's other designated platforms comply fully with the DMA,"" the Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC said.

The Tuesday pronouncement does not mean that Apple and Microsoft themselves won't still be treated as gatekeepers under the EU rules.

Their core platforms services, for example Apple's App Store and Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform, will still count as gatekeepers under the DMA, according to a ruling made on September 2023.

""The decisions do not affect in any way the designation of Apple and Microsoft as gatekeepers on 5 September 2023 as regards their other core platform services,"" the Commission said in a press update Tuesday.

""The Commission will continue to monitor the developments on the market with respect to these services, should any substantial changes arise.""

The EU Digital Markets Act, which entered into force on Nov. 1, 2022, and became largely applicable on May 2 of last year imposes a number of strict requirements on large technology platform companies, especially on U.S. technology giants like Meta, Apple, and Amazon.

The EU has some key targets in its sights, namely companies it designates as ""gatekeepers"" — businesses that are so crucial to web use that competition regulators believe they should open their services to allow smaller competitors access.

Late last year, the EU unveiled six designated gatekeeper that would be subject to its rules: Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and TikTok owner ByteDance.

Some publishers and technology firms say that these huge tech companies haven't done enough to engage effectively with them and with others in their industry. Apple recently opened up its App Store for third-party developers in Europe, which could threaten the iPhone giant's lucrative fees.",2/13/2024,1,0.044626214,0.086123824,0.002267124,0.827884972,0.037887782,0.001210127
387,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/12/microsoft-ai-growth-helping-azure-cloud-chip-away-at-amazons-lead.html,MSFT,Microsoft,Microsoft's AI growth is helping its cloud business weaken Amazon's lead,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appears at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 16, 2024.

Amazon Web Services is still the cloud leader. But Microsoft is quickly closing the gap.

While Microsoft doesn't disclose revenue figures for its Azure cloud infrastructure, analyst figures suggest that five years ago it was half as big as AWS. Now, it's about three-quarters the size of its top rival, analysts estimate.

Part of Microsoft's recent momentum is because of artificial intelligence.

Amy Hood, the company's finance chief, said on Microsoft's Jan. 30 earnings call that 6 points of revenue growth in the Azure and cloud services division came from AI in the latest period, up from 3 points the prior quarter.

In total, revenue at Azure increased 30% in the quarter, compared with 13% year-over-year growth at AWS.

Microsoft has been adding graphics processing units (GPUs) to its data centers so that clients can run AI models in Azure. That includes GPT-4, a large language model that enables text conversations with OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot. Many businesses have been adding similar generative AI capabilities to their products.

""We now have 53,000 Azure AI customers,"" CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on the company's earnings call.

Jamin Ball, partner at investment firm Altimeter Capital, said it seems that some companies are considering Azure specifically because of the excitement surrounding AI and Microsoft's perceived lead in the market due to its close relationship with OpenAI.

AWS took months to come out with a model that could go up against GPT-4. The company is now offering a number of models in addition to its own, including one from Anthropic, which Amazon backed. On the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that AWS offers ""the most expansive collection of compute instances with Nvidia chips,"" and that customers including Airbnb and Snap are using its homegrown AI processors.",2/12/2024,-2,0.100308262,0.346161038,0.004846372,0.49146232,0.053942319,0.003279685
388,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/03/8-of-our-stocks-report-earnings-next-week-what-we-want-to-see.html,MPWR,Monolithic Power Systems,8 more of our stocks report earnings next week. Here's what we want to see,"The three major averages posted gains for the fourth week in row, lifted by strong quarterly earnings results for most of the Big Tech companies and a strong jobs report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite rose about 1% for the week, while the S & P 500 gained 1.2%. We are now nearly halfway through this earnings season. Of the 46% of the S & P 500 companies that have reported December quarter results so far, 72% had an upside earnings surprise, while 65% reported better-than-expected revenue results. On the macroeconomic front, it was all about jobs. A weaker ADP Employment report on Wednesday provided no read-through to the monster January jobs report Friday. The U.S. added 353,000 jobs in last month, way above the 185,000 economists had predicted. Moreover, both the December and November numbers were revised higher by a combined 126,000 jobs. Wage inflation was also hotter than expected, rising 4.5% versus the year ago period, above the 4.1% estimate. That initially caused a slight pullback in the futures of all three major averages, but the selling was short-lived as investors took comfort in the idea that the economy continues to chug along despite the elevated interest rates. It looks like good news is good news for the time being. Should inflation bounce back, that may not be the case. But the latest data shows inflation is coming down to more manageable levels, and folks are still at work and companies are growing sales and earnings as a result. The soft landing remains very much in play. Here's what we're keeping an eye on in the coming week: 1. Services. It will be a very light week on the macroeconomic front, but the ISM Services PMI will kick things off on Monday. Economists are looking for a reading of 52.3% for January, which would represent an accelerated expansion versus the 50.6% reading in December. As a reminder, the ISM report measures the rate of contraction/expansion, measured by the distance from that 50-level benchmark; the further below 50, the faster the contraction and the further above 50, the faster the rate of expansion. 2. Earnings: It's another big earnings week head for the portfolio, with 8 more of our companies reporting. Estee Lauder , out Monday, has been highly problematic for a while now. Management's inability to forecast has resulted in disappointment after disappointment. We have a 4 rating on the name, meaning we're pretty much on the sidelines until we get more and better information. With China proving awful for Apple , Starbucks and Procter & Gamble , we aren't getting our hopes up for the luxury cosmetics company that relies heavily on tourism spending in the world's second largest economy. If Estee can simply maintain guidance, that may spark a relief rally. It's likely nothing to get too excited about, but we would consider that a win as it would buy managment some time to get back on track. On Tuesday, Eli Lilly earnings is all about an update on the sales of its blockbuster Type 2 diabetes and weight-loss drug Mounjaro and the rate of growth for obesity treatment Zepbound. A positive update on Zepbound weekly subscriptions helped propel shares higher in January. We trimmed our position in GE Healthcare this past week to hedge against weak orders from China. However, we're keeping shares on the view that the rollout of Alzheimer's treatments and the integration of artificial intelligence into its products will lead to stronger pricing and higher margins. We'll listen for confirmation of this thesis when the company reports Tuesday. DuPont already preannounced the quarter, so expectations are low for Tuesday's report. As a result, the focus is entirely on the post-earnings conference call with investors. We'd like management's view on where the operating environment goes from here to help inform whether we stick with the troubled industrial name or move on. We need to better understand how bad the China destocking dynamic, and would love the announcement of a buyback to stop the bleeding in the stock. Consistency is what we appreciate most from nat gas giant Linde , so we're hoping for another quarter of solid earnings growth Tuesday. More broadly, we'd like to know if the company is benefiting from the global transition toward clean energy, along with management's expectation for volume growth in 2024. For Ford earnings, also out Tuesday, electric vehicle losses will be a key watch item. Given the waning demand for EVs, we're looking for management to really emphasize its new focus on hybrid vehicles, the sweet spot between EVs and traditional ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles. We're looking for signs Ford can replicate the results at General Motors , which reported a profit beat in the fourth quarter and forecasted a stronger-than-expected 2024. One of the keys this year for the automaker is minimizing self-inflicted wounds. Too much money was left on the table last year because of warranty costs. Ford must fix its quality issues. Disney, which reports Wednesday, has to show continued progress on cost savings and efficiency initiatives. The pressure is on with activist investor Nelson Peltz of Trian Partners back in the picture. Aside from Disney+, where we hope the company can share the profit margin potential for the streaming platform once it breaks even — expected to happen by the end of the fiscal year. What's happening with ESPN, which we feel isn't being appropriately leveraged to its full potential? As with Estee, there is a China problem for Wynn Resorts, which has properties in Macau. Fortunately, management has proven effective operators (unlike the team at Estee Lauder in recent quarters) and the weakness in China is well understood by the market. As a result, we don't think expectations are overly high for its print on Wednesday. In the third quarter, we learned that Macau properties were generating 85% of 2019 levels. Any further progress toward achieving 100% of those 2019 levels would be great. The market is looking for sequential growth across both China properties (with sequential growth in Wynn Macau – which came up short in the third quarter – expected to more than offset a slight sequential decline at Wynn Palace. As for Vegas, we expect to see some benefit from the F1 Las Vegas Grand Prix; the inaugural race was on Nov. 18 of last year.

Please refresh every 20-30 minutes to view the latest posts.) Netflix was in focus Tuesday after the streaming giant got a big downgrade. Citi lowered its rating on the stock to neutral from buy, noting expectations for the company have become too lofty. Shares fell slightly in the premarket. Elsewhere, Deutsche Bank upgraded JPMorgan Chase to buy from hold. Check out the latest calls and chatter below. 8:44 a.m. ET: Bank of America downgrades JetBlue to underperform JetBlue has rallied since November, but a tough backdrop for domestic airlines and engine issues could weigh on the New York air carrier, according to Bank of America. The firm on Tuesday downgraded JetBlue to underweight from neutral and cut its price target in half to $3, saying issues with Geared TurboFan (GTF) engines could pressure growth and costs in 2024. The stock traded lower by 5% premarket. ""We forecast -1.4% capacity growth in 2024 … as the number of aircraft out of service due to GTF maintenance nearly doubles from 6 in 4Q23 to over 10 by year end 2024,"" accounting for about 3% of its fleet, Bank of America analyst Andrew Didora said in a note Tuesday. ""Historically, JBLU has needed to grow nearly mid- to high-single digits to get flattish [costs per available seat mile], so our new capacity forecast results in CASM +6%."" The downgrade comes after the company also announced late Monday that CEO Robin Hayes will step down Feb. 12 and be replaced by President and Chief Operating Officer Joanna Geraghty. Additionally, Didora mentioned execution risk as the market awaits a ruling in the Department of Justice's lawsuit against JetBlue to block its acquisition of Spirit Airlines. — Tanaya Macheel 8:31 a.m. ET: Bernstein lays out top restaurant stocks for 2024 With 2024 set to be the first ""normal"" year for restaurants since 2019, Bernstein has some stocks worth watching. Analyst Danilo Gargiulo listed Chipotle and Restaurant Brands International , the parent of chains including Tim Hortons and Burger King, as his top picks. He has outperform ratings on both. Gargiulo said the former should show topline resilience as consumer sentiment cools. Margin expansion should continue as productivity improves, while accelerated unit growth in the back half of 2023 can buoy investor interest. And he said Restaurant Brands' international business to show hidden strength, bringing investors to what the analyst called a ""rekindled growth story."" Outperformance in Tim Hortons and improvements at Burger King should also help, he added. In addition, Gargiulo raised Chipotle's price target by $100 to $2,400 per share, now implying an upside of 7.3%. His $85 target for Restaurant Brands International reflects a gain of 8.8%. While not a top pick, he upgraded Domino's Pizza to market perform from underperform and increased his target price by $40 to $370. Still, this new level requires shares to slide 8.1% from Monday's close. While there's reasons for optimistic in the short term, he emphasized caution when looking at the longer-term story. ""Despite continued skepticism on pizza category outlook, we believe the near-term setup for 2024 has turned attractive and there are no immediate catalysts that could materially pressure DPZ,"" he said. ""However, we believe that valuation has run ahead of growth expectations and will eventually re-rate downward as the dynamics of a hyper competitive, mature category ... translates to moderating growth beyond the ST growth catalysts."" — Alex Harring 8:29 a.m. ET: HSBC upgrades Nu Holdings to buy Latin American bank Nu Holdings should have another big year ahead, according to HSBC. Analyst Neha Agarwala upgraded the Brazil-based financial firm to buy from hold, saying in a note to clients that Nu appears to have earnings momentum after its stock surged in 2023. ""With the key risk of regulatory changes in credit cards pushed further out to the horizon and asset quality trends stabilizing, we believe the coast is clear for Nu to accelerate personal loan origination which should drive up profitability in 2024; growth in payroll loans should help further. Showing success in Mexico will likely be a concern for 2025,"" the note said. Shares of Nu more than doubled in 2023, and the stock is already up more than 6% this year. HSBC hiked its price target on Nu to $10 per share from $8.70. The new target is 12.5% above where shares of Nu closed on Monday. — Jesse Pound 8:11 a.m. ET: Piper Sandler upgrades GoDaddy, cites reversal in multiple compression Piper Sandler upgraded shares of GoDaddy to overweight as the website domain company situates itself to bounce back from a five-year trend of multiple compression. ""Looking ahead to 2024; we see an opportunity for positive growth revisions in our higher quality names without losing progress on profitability,"" wrote Clarke Jeffries in a Tuesday note. The analyst downgraded shares last year as growth compressed to the mid-single digits. But a quicker-than-expected bounce in margins is situating GoDaddy for a 29% net debt-to-EBITDA margin exit rate for 2023 and 8% domain bookings growth in the last quarter. This is also positioning GoDaddy for a reacceleration to high-single-digit growth in the new year and a NEBITDA margin exceeding 30%. Along with the upgrade, Jeffries lifted the firm's price target to $121 from $100 a share, reflecting about 19% upside from Monday's close. — Samantha Subin 8:08 a.m. ET: BofA recommends buying United Airlines stock for first time since 2020 Analyst Andrew Didora upgraded United Airlines to buy from underperform and raised his price target by $16 to $56. Didora's new target reflects the potential for shares to rally 30.5% in the next year from Monday's close. ""Today, we see a valuation disconnect vs UAL's execution and its more favorable leverage outlook than expected,"" he said. ""While industry risks remain ... and capex is above historical norms, UAL has outperformed the industry on revenues, can maintain about 2.5x leverage through this capex cycle, and trades at just 4.5x our 2024E EBITDAR, towards the low end of historical valuations."" It marks the first time Bank of America has had a buy rating on United since March 2020. Between then and now, he said a relatively high valuation and capital expenditures, as well as leverage concerns, had made the firm cautious. The upgrade comes as recent events have created challenges for the air travel sector. United was among airlines that found loose hardware on Boeing planes. Those discoveries came during a grounding that was prompted by a door plug blowing out during an Alaska Airlines flight last week. United shares advanced 1.6% before the bell. — Alex Harring 8:07 a.m. ET: Jefferies turns bullish on KeyCorp, Regions Financial Jefferies turned bullish on two regional banks. Analyst Ken Usdin upgraded KeyCorp and Regions Financial to buy from hold. He also raised the price targets for both, with the new anticipated levels implying upsides of 15.6% for KeyBanc and 12.8% for Regions from Monday's close. Specifically, he increased his price target on KeyCorp to $17 from $10. His Regions target went up to $22 from $15. ""Bank valuations have expanded as the market adjusts for peak/lower rates. ... P/Es remain below historical avgs., with potential for more expansion in a benign soft landing, plus help from growing book values and capital ratios,"" Usdin wrote to clients, using shorthand for the price-to-earnings ratio and earnings per share. ""The timing bridge between '24 EPS softness and '25 improvement will be important."" Usdin said KeyCorp's forward price-to-earnings remains the lowest among large-cap regional banks, even after the stock bounced from its fall 2023 low. The bank should also see some of the biggest benefits to forward net interest income as low-yield securities and low rate receive-fixed swaps mature. Fee performance should also improve as near-flat costs boost positive operating leverage in 2024 and 2025, the analyst added. Regions is also still at a price-to-earnings discount compared with peers, despite resetting many expectations in its October guidance, Usdin said. The market better understands challenges on net interest income, while consensus still needs to adjust 2024 costs to the right basis. Meanwhile, he said capital is strong as buybacks have resumed. KeyCorp added 0.6% in Tuesday's premarket trading, while Regions climbed 0.4%. — Alex Harring 7:48 a.m. ET: Morgan Stanley downgrades CyberArk, cites lack of near-term catalysts CyberArk is a promising long-term contender but falls short in the near term, according to Morgan Stanley. The bank downgraded shares of the identity management software company to equal weight from overweight, although it lifted its price target to $240 from $195. This implies a 10.1% potential upside from the stock's Monday closing price of $217.99. Analyst Hamza Fodderwala noted that while he is bullish on the name in the long term, he sees limited room for upside in the near term. ""We think the company has improved its position with a higher mix of recurring SaaS revenue in recent years. However, nearer term, we think the setup is more difficult and outperformance in CYBR shares is unlikely,"" he wrote. The analyst attributed this to two factors. First, he thinks that annual recurring revenue is likely to slow. The stock already seems to have priced in investor expectations for 30% growth in 2024, above consensus estimates of 26% — which could lead investors disappointed. ""While migration from the existing maintenance base to SaaS should provide a multi-year tailwind, we think the shift will be more gradual and the ASP uplift may be less than expected due to CyberArk's premium pricing vs competitors,"" Fodderwala noted. The analyst added that there's limited upside to the company's free cash flow margins as cloud hosting costs rise and new product investments increase. ""Net, with the stock up +70% over the last year vs Nasdaq +48% and lack of upside catalysts nearer term, we're moving to the sidelines and would look for a more attractive entry point,"" he wrote. CyberArk shares are down 0.5% to start the year. However, they are coming off a 69% gain in 2023. CYBR 1Y mountain CYBR in past year — Lisa Kailai Han 7:20 a.m. ET: BofA calls Ferrari a top auto pick, noting 'intangible brand value' and 'true luxury status' Bank of America named Ferrari a top auto stock for the new year. Analyst John Murphy said the Italian sports car maker also has a buy rating. He called the company a ""unique asset with significant intangible brand value and a true luxury status."" ""We believe the company's balanced strategy of restrained volume growth, strong price increases, and new model introductions over our forecast period should drive strong consistent revenue and earnings growth,"" he told clients. ""In our view, the stock should outperform in 2024 given the resiliency of its financial performance in periods of macro uncertainty."" Ferrari's outlook should remain conservative, while the majority of benefits should come from mix and price, he said. Any easing of material costs or supply chain snafus can also help. Ferrari shares are coming off their best year since 2019, surging 58% in 2023. To start 2024, the stock is up 1.7%. Murphy also listed retailers Asbury Automotive Group and AutoNation as best ideas, citing strong free cash flow. That can allow for capital allocation to buybacks and acquisitions, among other initiatives. 7:06 a.m. ET: Morgan Stanley downgrades PayPal, citing glacial strategic initiative cycles There's reason for pause on PayPal as the digital payment platform shows slower-than-expected progress on strategic initiatives, according to Morgan Stanley. Analyst James Faucette downgraded the financial technology stock to equal weight from overweight and slashed his price target to $66 from $118. Faucette's new target implies shares can advance just 6.9% from Monday's close over the next year. ""Product evolution and progress on key strategic imperatives, ... which are key to supporting faster-than-eComm growth, are taking longer than we initially thought,"" Faucette wrote to clients. PayPal is moving ""too slowly"" on key strategic initiatives like improving branded checkout and expanding Venmo, Faucette said. Any acceleration is difficult given the company's relationships, the analyst added. He's also less optimistic that PayPal can monetize Venmo as a checkout tool for younger shoppers. A larger share of these consumers would help the company grow at above-average rates, he said. More broadly, Faucette said he's losing confidence that the company can investment enough to make meaningful improvements to its business in the near future. Still, he said the company should be able to grow revenue in line with other e-commerce peers, excluding Amazon. Shares slipped 2.4% in premarket trading on Tuesday. PayPal has fallen for three straight years. In 2023, the stock lost 13.8%. — Alex Harring 6:42 a.m. ET: HSBC says buy Citigroup, hold Morgan Stanley HSBC replaced Morgan Stanley with Citigroup on its list of buy-worthy bank stocks. Analyst Saul Martinez upgraded Citigroup to buy from hold, while giving Morgan Stanley the reverse treatment. His price targets of $61 and $96 suggest upside of 12.9% for the former and 2.7% for the latter. Despite noting that the revenue outlook still has challenges, Martinez said the fundamental backdrop for U.S. banks has improved in recent months. Namely, he said that moderating deposit cost pressure should help net interest income hit a bottom and earnings expectations are positive. Investors can add exposure to banks through Citigroup as management credibility increases and there's more opportunity for buybacks, Martinez said. Still, he said Goldman Sachs is the ""preferred way"" to play a recovery in capital markets specifically. Elsewhere, he noted Morgan Stanley has seen cuts to earnings estimates even as the share price has risen. That's created an increase to the price-to-earnings multiple while expectations for wealth management revenue soften. Citigroup advanced around 0.4% in Tuesday premarket trading, while Morgan Stanley slipped 1.6%. — Alex Harring 6:23 a.m. ET: Oppenheimer names Nvidia a top pick entering semi earnings Nvidia is one of Oppenheimer's favorite names heading into semiconductor earnings. Artificial intelligence remains the top theme for semis in 2024, analyst Rick Schafer said, after it led growth in the prior year. A focus will be on how companies monetize their strategies in the space, the analyst added. Looking to 2024, he said picking the right names in the space is increasingly important after 2023's ""correction year."" In addition to Nvidia, he pointed to Marvell Technology, Monolithic Power Systems and Broadcom as top picks. Schafer said the best growth stories in the sector outperformed in 2023, with the top picks group surging 125% on average. By comparison, the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) gained a relatively modest 65.6%. Following an initial inflection, he said history shows that the group of best ideas should gain another 11% in 2024. Semiconductor earnings kick off the week beginning on Jan. 22, according to the analyst. — Alex Harring 6:07 a.m. ET: Goldman says Interactive Brokers is a buy that investors have overlooked due to interest rate concerns Investors should snap up Interactive Brokers as oversensitivity to potential interest rate cuts unnecessarily cheapens the stock, according to Goldman Sachs. Analyst James Yaro upgraded the brokerage to buy from neutral. His $102 price target, up from $88, shows a potential gain of 16.4% in the next year from Monday's close. ""We see current valuation as offering an attractive entry point, with risk skewed to the upside,"" he told clients. Interactive Brokers has underperformed rate-sensitive peers since six month before the first cut to the Federal Reserve funds rate, Yaro said. But the analyst warned that the market may have over-extrapolated the company's connection to interest rates. Indeed, he said the company should be able to offset a hit from interest rate cuts by the Fed. That's because it has balance sheet growth, a shift in mix and increasing commissions. The analyst also found that the company can likely keep earnings per share growth flat in a down environment. Yaro said upside can stem from a focus on capital priorities, which can drive dividend growth or acquisitions. A bank license in the European Union can also help unlock capital, he added. Interactive Brokers Group rose just over 14.5% in 2023, underperforming the broader market. — Alex Harring 5:47 a.m. ET: Morgan Stanley upgrades CrowdStrike, says cybersecurity tech provider is 'firing on all cylinders' Morgan Stanley said traders should flock to CrowdStrike shares. Analyst Hamza Fodderwala upgraded the cybersecurity software stock to overweight from equal weight and raised his price target by $101 to $304. His new target reflects the potential for shares to climb 16.4% from Monday's closing level. ""We are upgrading CRWD ... based on improving demand, broader platform traction and multiple product cycles still ramping up, including the recently launched Charlotte AI,"" Fodderwala said, adding that the company is ""firing on all cylinders."" ""We think these factors should result in more meaningful upside to ARR and FCF forecasts throughout the year,"" he added, using acronyms for annual recurring revenue and free cash flow. That allows for ""driving the stock higher despite significant outperformance over the last year."" CrowdStrike is the ""leading beneficiary"" as ransomware becomes more common given the company's s incident response and endpoint security services, Fodderwala said. In fact, attacks grew by a clip of more than 70% last year, leading to growth in professional services revenue, according to the analyst. Elsewhere, Fodderwala pointed to multiple product cycles still ramping up. In particular, he pointed to the company's ""strong position"" for leveraging and monetizing generative artificial intelligence. CrowdStrike's Charlotte AI can add $100 million in annual recurring revenue by 2025 if there's 10% penetration in the installation base, he said. To be sure, Fodderwala knows his upgrade comes after a strong year for the stock, with shares outperforming security peers and the Nasdaq Composite in 2023. While he admitted to being late to the party, he said investors aren't too late to buy in given the reasons for optimism. CRWD .IXIC 1Y mountain CRWD vs Nasdaq in past year Shares rose 2% before the bell on Tuesday. — Alex Harring 5:32 a.m. ET: Citi downgrades Netflix, says streaming giant could underperform on some Street projections Investors should move to the sidelines on Netflix as Wall Street's expectations have gotten too grandiose, Citi warned. Analyst Jason Bazinet downgraded the streaming giant to neutral from buy. His $500 price target implies an upside of 3.1% from Monday's close. ""Across 2024 and 2025, the Street has lofty expectations for Netflix. We see three potential risks,"" Bazinet wrote to clients. ""At prevailing levels, we find the risk-reward relatively balanced."" Bazinet said the first of those three reasons is that 2024 revenue expectations may be too high. Next, 2025 content investments should be higher than analysts anticipate. And finally, he said potential acquisitions can't be ruled out. Given these risks, he said the risk-reward ratio is no longer compelling. Bazinet's downgrade comes on the heels of a strong year for Netflix, making Bazinet's upside expectations relatively muted. Shares rallied more than 65% in 2023, regaining some ground after dropping more than 50% in the prior year. Netflix stock slipped 2.1% before the bell Tuesday. — Alex Harring 5:32 a.m. ET: Deutsche Bank upgrades JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase shares have more upside left in them after a stellar 2023, according to Deutsche Bank. Analyst Matt O'Connor raised his rating on the bank to buy from hold and raised his price target to $190 from $140 per share. The new forecast indicates a potential gain of 10.5% from Monday's close. ""Shares should benefit from upside to net interest income guidance (vs. downside risk at peers), good leverage to a pick up in capital markets revenues, and strong capital and loan loss reserve levels,"" O'Connor wrote. ""And while we wouldn't argue JPM shares are cheap, they also aren't expensive at 11.5x our 2024e or just a slight premium to the broader group multiple of 11.0x.""

Getting your affairs in order ensures your loved ones aren't left scrambling over your assets or debts when you pass away. There are a lot of misconceptions about estate planning — like, that it's only for the wealthy or that you don't need to worry about it until later in life. Everyone should make their wishes clear — and the earlier you can start, the better. Below, CNBC Select looks into what estate planning includes and how you can get started on the process.

What is estate planning?

Estate planning essentially involves deciding how your assets and belongings will be managed and distributed in the event of your death or incapacitation, typically through a legal document like a will or trust. Most people will need to determine how they want their bank accounts, investment accounts and life insurance policies allocated, as well as any property and personal possessions. Estate planning can also include assigning financial and medical power of attorney and, if you have children who are still minors, directions for their care. More help: 4 things you should know about inheritance tax Because estate planning encompasses so many things, it can be a daunting process. That's why it's best to not view it as a one-time action, but something you can start and revisit whenever circumstances call for it.

Your estate planning checklist

These steps will help get you started before drafting a will. Take an inventory of your assets Your tangible assets include items of monetary value — like your home, car, jewelry and collectibles — as well as those with sentimental value, like photographs, books and mementos. Intangible assets can include bank and brokerage accounts, retirement funds and insurance policies.



Keep a list of account numbers and the market value of your tangible assets and update it annually. List outstanding debt What happens to your debts after you pass away depends on what kind they are and the state you lived in. Unsecured debt like credit card bills and student loans is frequently written off. But if you have debts secured with collateral — like mortgages and car loans — those assets could be seized or sold to settle the balance. More help: What happens to your loans when you die? Writing down all your outstanding debts can help both your executor and your beneficiaries get a clearer picture of your estate. Choose an executor The executor or estate administrator is responsible for making sure your wishes are carried out. They will be compensated from the probate estate, though the specific amount varies according to the will or state law.



It's essential to have an honest conversation with the person you'd like to be your executor so they understand what's required and can consent to accept the responsibility. You may also want to let close friends and family know who you've selected so there's no confusion later.



You'll also want to appoint powers of attorney, who can make financial and medical decisions if you are unable to. Name guardians If you have minor children (or pets), decide who you want to take care of them if you die. Be sure to include a second choice, in case your first isn't able to assume the responsibility. Read on: Living trusts vs. wills — what's the best way to pass on an inheritance?



As with your executor, be crystal clear with this person about your wishes and what is expected of them if they agree. Select beneficiaries If you haven't already, you'll want to name beneficiaries for your retirement accounts, life insurance policies and annuities. Many states allow you to set up transfer-on-death deeds so they can bypass probate. Provide the beneficiary's full legal name and relationship to you. You may also need to include their date of birth, Social Security number and additional details. An entity can also be a beneficiary, including any charitable organizations you may want to pass assets on to.

Bottom line

Estate planning offers peace of mind to both you and those you leave behind. It's important to organize your financial records and make plans early and revisit them as your circumstances change.

The firm expects global M & A volume activity to rise 50% this year compared to 2023. It also forecasts a multiyear secular recovery, data from a new survey of 150 industry teams across the bank shows. Health care, real estate, consumer staples and technology are the most favored sectors for M & A within private markets, according to the survey. ""We believe that a cyclical and structural rebound in M & A is coming,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note titled ""Stocks with Elevated Likelihood of Receiving an Offer,"" which was released Monday. ""The structural case is driven by dry powder, private markets, regional shifts and new innovations … rising demand for AI capabilities, the clean energy transition, innovation in life sciences, reshoring and geographic diversification in a multipolar world should structurally support M & A over the next cycle."" A comeback this year would mark a sharp reversal from record-low global M & A volumes in 2023, which were partly caused by higher interest rates that drove up funding costs and led to declines in global equity markets. Morgan Stanley pointed out that 2021 to 2023 could have seen a drop of activity worth between $4 trillion and $11 trillion. The firm expects a reversion to normalized activity levels by 2026, with Europe leading the recovery. Necessity and opportunity should drive more M & A activity in nonlisted private companies, the firm said, noting that more than 1,200 unicorns are currently valued at $4 billion or more. ""Global listed non-financials hold US$5.6 trillion in cash while private market investors sit on US$2.5 trillion of dry powder, providing fuel for activity,"" the note said. The firm used quantitative models to screen for the stocks that have an elevated chance of receiving a deal offer in the next year. Take a look at some of the U.S. names below: Stocks that are smaller in size, have a lower price-to-book ratio, higher quality and within sectors that have seen a higher number of offers are the names more likely to receive a tender offer. Morgan Stanley said it has no information about M & A activity involving the companies. The firm's screen is just theoretical. Several health-care names were named, including Sarepta Therapeutics and Tenet Healthcare . Analysts are generally fond of Sarepta, a biotech that focuses on treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The stock has a consensus buy rating and $164.42 target price, per FactSet, suggesting shares could gain 32.6% since Monday's close. BMO Capital Markets initiated coverage of Sarepta at an outperform rating on Jan. 31, and said the company could have a strong year as its latest drug, Elevidys, continues to see strong patient demand. TripAdvisor is another name that could receive an M & A offer within the next year, according to Morgan Stanley's screen. Analysts surveyed by FactSet have a $27.19 target price on the online travel company, which suggests just 2.7% upside for shares. So far this year, the stock has climbed more than 23%. On Feb. 16, UBS analyst Stephen Ju had upped his price target on the stock by $6 to $27 and maintained his neutral rating, viewing TripAdvisor's fourth-quarter earnings and revenue beat as a favorable sign of future growth and profitability. Fast-food chain Wingstop was also a potential beneficiary of M & A trends. Several firms increased their price targets on Wingstop after the company surpassed revenue and earnings expectations for the fourth quarter. It also reported record-breaking new guest acquisitions. But the stock's more-than 39% run so far this year suggests shares could decline roughly 11% from its latest close price of $366.51, according to consensus FactSet estimates.

Morgan Stanley has plans to cut several hundred employees in the division as new CEO Ted Pick tries to keep costs in check, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. While impacting less than 1% of the division's workforce, the cuts represent Pick's first big move at the helm of the firm and Morgan Stanley's need to drill down on expenses. Morgan Stanley declined CNBC's request for comment. Pick, a veteran of the bank, officially took the reins from longtime CEO James Gorman on Jan. 1. During his tenure at the helm, Gorman pivoted Morgan Stanley to rely less on investment banking by building up wealth management, which has a more predictable revenue stream. MS YTD mountain Morgan Stanley (MS) year-to-date performance Possible layoffs in wealth management are important because it's Morgan Stanley's largest operating segment — making up roughly half of companywide revenue. Any reductions there can have an outsized benefit toward reducing costs to stay on track to meet, and hopefully exceed, Pick's conservative reset guidance . Despite delivering in mid-January a better-than-expected fourth quarter, shares dropped more than 4% on earnings day as investors worried about the picture the new CEO was painting for the future. It didn't help that Q4 results for all of the major banks were rather messy as they were forced to pay the FDIC back for rescuing regional lenders after last year's failure of Silicon Valley Bank. On the post-earnings call, Pick said the bank was far from reaching management's previously issued goal of 30% operating margins for wealth management. To make matters worse, he said that headwinds such as geopolitical conflicts and the state of the U.S. economy could weigh on profits. Elevated interest rates have continued to pressure margins. (And, Tuesday's hotter-than-expected inflation data certainly hurt the case for a near-term start of Fed rate cuts.) At the time, we weren't thrilled with the quarterly results.

Morgan Stanley promoted a tech executive in its wealth management division to become the bank's first head of firm-wide artificial intelligence, CNBC has learned.

The bank is elevating Jeff McMillan, a veteran of the New York-based bank, to help guide its implementation of AI across the firm, according to a memo sent Thursday from co-presidents Andy Saperstein and Dan Simkowitz.

Last year, Morgan Stanley became the first major Wall Street firm to create a solution for employees based on OpenAI's GPT-4, a project overseen by McMillan.

The move shows the rising importance of artificial intelligence in financial services, sparked by the meteoric rise of generative AI tools that create human-like responses to queries.

While Wall Street firms broadly pared back jobs last year, they competed to fill thousands of AI positions, poaching employees from one another.

In June, JPMorgan named Teresa Heitsenrether its chief data and analytics officer in charge of AI adoption. At Goldman Sachs , Chief Information Officer Marco Argenti is seen as the lead AI advocate.

It said Japan stands out, with 53% of companies seen as AI beneficiaries — nearly matching the United States' 54%, above Europe's 50% and Asia-Pacific ex-Japan's 39%. ""Tightening labour markets and digitalisation policy initiatives make this an underappreciated opportunity, in our view,"" the bank said in a Feb. 8 report. Beneficiaries could be both AI adopters and enablers — or those that are a mix of both, according to Morgan Stanley. AI enablers facilitate the use of AI for other companies. The greatest share of AI beneficiaries in Asia and emerging markets were found in IT and communications, it said. ""Financials were also seen as well advanced in AI adoption plans, with a view to benefits materialising over the next 12-24 months for over half of constituents,"" it said, adding that health care and health tech could also be beneficiaries. At the opposite end of the spectrum, sectors Morgan Stanley said had ""unknown"" AI impact included real estate, materials and energy. The utilities sector largely fits that bill but, it noted, may benefit from a rapid growth in electricity demand to power AI servers and computing. AI enablers have been the strongest performers in all regions, though companies in Asia-Pacific lagged their peers in Japan and the United States, according to the bank.

On the other hand, BYD , which is equal weight, will likely face another round of downward revisions from analysts due to market saturation in China, Hsiao wrote. ""Although the macroeconomic and operational environment is certainly challenging, we think the negative forces influencing the trio of EV stocks are more or less [already reflected] in stock prices,"" Hsiao told clients.

The auto sector in China has sold off about 30% year to date as companies work through bloated inventory due to seasonal market weakness, Hsiao wrote. EV penetration fell from a peak of 40% in December to 33.5% this year as makers of internal combustion engine cars pushed sales aggressively ahead of the Chinese New Year, according to the analyst. Despite a rough start to the year, Chinese EV makers are expected to launch a record number of new models and accelerate expansion plans in Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia, at the same time as they're seeing lower battery costs, Hsiao wrote. Li Auto has booked several profitable quarters in a row, demonstrating solid execution of model launches and effective cost management, Hsiao told clients. Morgan Stanley has boosted total sales volume for the company by 12% in 2024 and 8% in 2025, reflecting stronger demand for new models. Hsiao has a price target of $74 for Li Auto's ADR shares, which implies that the company's stock could double in value from its recent close below $36.50. Xpeng has also successfully launched several new models and has a strong pipeline, the investment bank said, with Morgan Stanley expecting monthly sales to accelerate compared to the second half of 2023, according to Hsiao. The price target of $18 for Xpeng's ADRs imply upside of about 90% from its previous close of $9.52. Nio's plan to introduce a mass market brand could lead to upside for the company's vehicle sales volume, according to Hsiao. Morgan Stanley has a price target of $10 for Nio's ADRs, equal to roughly 72% upside from the previous close of $5.80.",3/11/2024,0,0.139549702,0.142697304,0.003117408,0.255396962,0.456019133,0.00321951
396,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/18/netflix-reports-results-after-the-bell-what-wall-street-is-watching.html,MS,Morgan Stanley,Netflix earnings are about to hit the Street. Here’s what traders need to know,"The unofficial start of the first-quarter reporting season for technology giants begins with Netflix after the bell Thursday. Shares of the media behemoth have kicked off the year on a strong note, rallying nearly 26% and outperforming the broader S & P 500. The pressure is on for Netflix following two back-to-back quarterly reports that boosted shares double-digits in the ensuing trading sessions. Last quarter, Netflix fell short of earnings expectations but topped revenue estimates and total memberships. The company also added 13.1 million subscribers , easily topping Wall Street 8 million to 9 million estimate — helped in part by its harsh crackdown on password sharing. NFLX YTD mountain Shares this year For the first quarter, analysts polled by LSEG expect Netflix to report earnings of $4.52 per share on roughly $9.28 billion in revenue. The closely-watched subscriber add figure is expected to come in at 4.59 million, according to Street Account. Wall Street anticipates a largely rosy setup for the stock, with many forecasting that the company beats, or reports in line with expectations. The anticipation contributed to some Wall Street firms lifting their price targets heading into the print. This month, Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne retained his overweight rating and hiked his price target to $700 a share, implying 14% upside from Wednesday's close. JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth lifted his price target to $650 a share, citing ongoing subscriber growth from paid sharing. ""Netflix's track record includes pivoting from DVD to streaming, scaling the world's largest studio, and successfully monetizing password sharing,"" wrote Morgan Stanley's Swinburne. ""This track record, combined with new call options (ads, games, live sports) and a 25%+ EPS [compound annual growth rate], supports a premium multiple,"" and justifies a continued overweight rating. To be sure, some analysts with neutral ratings on the stock have also increase their price targets in recent weeks to account for the stock runup, and some earnings and free cash flow adjustments. Piper Sandler lifted its target to $600 a share, while both Deutsche Bank and Barclays moved to a $550 target from $525 and $475, respectively. Ongoing paid sharing tailwinds? Outside of the top and bottom line figures, Wall Street's keeping a close watch on paid sharing, otherwise known as the company's recent crackdown on password sharing. While no specific metric tracks paid sharing, benefits typically show up in subscriber numbers. In fact, the clampdown helped boost subscriber numbers well above expectations in the past two quarters, contributing to strong additions in the third and fourth quarters of 2024. Analysts expect these tailwinds to ease at some point this year, but the crackdown should continue boosting the company's revenues and subscriber numbers at least in the first quarter. To reflect that, several Wall Street analysts recently lifted their subscriber addition numbers. Along with a price hike, JPMorgan's Anmuth raised the bank's estimate to 6 million from 4.5 million this month, citing paid sharing, alongside a strong content slate and the build out of Netflix's advertising tier. Under the paid sharing plan , Netflix account owners can buy an extra member slot and invite people outside their household to use the service. ""While the lowest hanging fruit was captured in 2023, we believe Netflix still has meaningful Paid Sharing monetization opportunity as it tightens filters across specific use cases & borrower cohorts,"" Anmuth wrote. Also in April, Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan lifted the firm's estimate for net adds for the first quarter to 7.2 million from 6.6 million, while Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft upped his estimate by 1.5 million to 7 million. Kraft estimates that Netflix has added about 20 million new accounts, or about 25 million households, through this initiative. But that growth will begin to fade at some point this year. ""After 1Q24, Netflix begins to lap the paid sharing benefits - most significantly in 2H24,"" wrote Morgan Stanley's Swinburne. ""This is when we estimate net adds decline YoY."" Reason for caution Despite Netflix's strong run this year and the benefits reaped through paid sharing, some Wall Street analysts see reasons for caution. Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar retained his equal weight rating on the stock despite its recent strong performance and subscriber numbers, noting that much of the company's growth potential appears priced in and while long-term margin expectations may be too high. Deutsche Bank's Kraft also expressed some caution on the 450% increase in Netflix's share price over the last 18 months, saying that it creates a ""tricky set up"" heading into the print. ""We believe that in order for the stock to appreciate further, consensus estimates for 2024-2025 will need to be revised higher, as we believe a lot is already priced in at these valuation levels,"" he wrote, adding that paid sharing should ""normalize"" at some point this year. Piper Sandler's Matt Farrell said that he's bracing for a pullback to ""get more constructive"" given the recent run in the stock and heightened expectations. Investors may also be getting overexcited about the company's paid sharing initiative, with MoffettNathanson's Michael Nathanson retaining his neutral rating despite hiking the firm's subscriber estimates. ""That said, we continue to remain cautious of pie-in-the- sky forecasts that see this hockey stick continuing indefinitely– the password-sharing crackdown was likely a pull-forward of growth and does not change the underlying fact that there are increasingly fewer and fewer households in UCAN yet to subscribe to the streamer,"" he wrote. What else to watch Along with paid sharing, Wall Street's also keeping close watch on comments surrounding Netflix' ad-supported tier, which boasted 23 million users earlier this year . Farrell said in an April note that he's keeping an eye on the ramp up of the company's advertising business and on the lookout for signs of a ""advertising inflection."" ""We continue to wait for the pivot to 'walking' from 'crawling', but as the ad-tier competitive landscape intensifies, we suspect scale needs to happen sooner rather than later,"" adding that the scope of the ad-tier seems to be ""lagging expectations."" Wall Street will also be monitoring any comments related to Netflix's partnership with WWE , with Citi's Jason Bazinet noting that the company could potentially acquire NBA rights at some point in other regions. ""Following Netflix's WWE rights and the pending NBA rights, we believe investors will be listening for any change in tone regarding the company's sports strategy,"" he said.",4/18/2024,0,0.047317658,0.902164578,0.002796576,0.028259961,0.017248711,0.002212543

""Overall our TMT conference reinforced that industry conditions are in a bottoming process — albeit one that is out of phase across different end markets,"" analysts led by Joseph Moore wrote in a Sunday report to clients. ""We continue to be positive on the group, and we want some AI exposure and some cyclical exposure."" Moore named Nvidia , Western Digital and Microchip Technology as the investment bank's favorite names coming out of the conference. Computer drive maker Western Digital is the firm's top pick. Moore noted that WDC raised its revenue and earnings guidance at the conference, and said the company's NAND business will retain its ""significant value proposition"" given that the CEO will remain with that side of the company. Western Digital announced in late October that it will split its hard disk drive and NAND memory businesses into two separate public companies. NAND flash memory is a type of nonvolatile storage technology that can store data without power . Moore foresees strong NAND fundamentals in the first half of 2024 and a potential modest fade in the second half of the year, before a ""return to peak earnings power in CY25."" ""Every semiconductor equipment company that we talked to highlighted that NAND spending will remain at minimal levels through CY24, even as DRAM spending and cutting edge fab spending hit new highs,"" he said. ""The picture could not be clearer — the enthusiasm for AI is drawing DRAM spending towards the siren song of high bandwidth memory, drawing away NAND spending and setting us up for a multiyear upturn in that space."" Western Digital shares are up 17.9% so far this year. With Nvidia, Moore thinks the rally in all stocks exposed to AI leaves it a ""likely outperformer."" Rack space and power, rather than graphics processing unit shortage, are leading to the stock's bottleneck to adding further AI capacity, the analyst said. He still believes the company is in a ""good place relative to that concern,"" however. Nvidia shares have soared more than 75% year to date, but fears about the concentrated AI-fueled rally have accumulated, leading the stock to stall on Friday and Monday. Microchip is another one of Morgan Stanley's picks following the tech conference. Moore noted that the company's February bookings rose from January, and that Microchip reiterated its guidance for the current quarter. Shares of Microchip are down 0.4% to start the new year, but are up almost 7% this month. Analysts' consensus rating on MCHP is overweight, with an average price target approaching $93 a share, which suggests a 4% decline from the stock's latest close, according to FactSet. ""As a core investment concept, we want to buy semiconductor stocks when they are materially undershipping end demand, all else being equal, and with revenues down nearly 40% from peak we think that's the case here,"" Moore said about Microchip. ""That would make this the most severe inventory correction of all time, and when that bottoms out we should see a nice recovery in 2h.""",3/11/2024,0,0.007658075,0.969363391,0.001670859,0.017542643,0.002800897,0.000964248
398,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/01/ai-is-fueling-global-power-demand-morgan-stanley-thinks-these-stocks-will-benefit.html,MS,Morgan Stanley,AI is fueling global power demand. Morgan Stanley sees opportunities for these 'underappreciated' winners,"Generative artificial intelligence is about to rapidly scale up global power demand. That's a boon for several power providers and data center builders. Morgan Stanley highlighted more than a dozen overweight-rated stocks that stand to benefit from the surge in generative AI power demand, which is increasingly being driven by the need to build and supply data centers that train and deploy advancing AI models . Power demand from generative AI will soar from 46 terawatt hours to 224 TWH between this year and 2027, according to the firm's base case scenario. That's equivalent to more than 75% of the total global data center power use in 2022, or close to Spain's entire power consumption in 2022, the firm said. ""We expect growth upside for power providers and data center infrastructure stocks, but do not expect GenAI power to move the needle for regulated utilities,"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in the Monday research note. ""We believe the rapid power demand growth from GenAI is not well understood, and not priced into a number of stocks."" To be clear, many of Morgan Stanley's picks are large-scale renewable energy and infrastructure stocks that stand to gain market share from this trend over time. CNBC recently reported on the companies that already specialize in servicing data centers' physical infrastructures and the power grids that supply these power-hungry sites. Here are some of the firm's top picks: Sustainable data centers Morgan Stanley's picks favor companies such as Bloom Energy , AES Corp and NextEra Energy , that provide scalable renewable energy because this will be an important focus for new data centers. That's because tech giants are trying to reach sustainability goals at the same time their businesses will need more energy to fuel generative AI. Google, for example, plans to use 100% carbon-free energy in its data centers by 2030, while Microsoft is aiming to operate on entirely renewable energy sources by 2025. Morgan Stanley's base case is that, if 80% of incremental data center power demand in the U.S. is from renewable energy, developers would need to build about 5 gigawatts of renewables this year, which should be manageable in most cases. ""We think the impact on global carbon emissions is likely to be small, while the sustainability benefits of GenAI are likely to be large,"" the analysts said. Bloom Energy has ""exceptionally high upside to (as yet unrealized) orders from data centers,"" the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in the note. That's because the company provides baseload power fuel cells — devices that generate electricity and heat by combining fuel with oxygen — to data center customers. ""BE is a secular winner as the world adopts GenAI given the significant incremental power demand associated with data center growth, coupled with grid infrastructure constraints and reliability concerns,"" analyst Andrew Percoco wrote in a Wednesday note where he called the stock an ""underappreciated AI winner."" Percoco estimates that generative AI could require 20 gigawatts of global electricity generation capacity through 2027. He expects Bloom could generate nearly $75 billion in near-term revenue for its fuel cell product. Bloom shares could rise more than 94% from its latest close, according to his price target. However, not all analysts agree, and the stock has lost about 18% so far this year. Bank of America recently downgraded shares to underperform from neutral, saying revenue will likely be about flat from 2023 to 2025 due to low orders. Among large-scale renewable developers in the U.S., AES has the largest commercial and industrial market share, according to Morgan Stanley. Percoco thinks AES' commercial relationships with Big Tech, including Google, Microsoft and Amazon, could be a strength in serving data center demand as these tech giants are considered to be the data center ""hyperscalers."" He estimates, however, that generative AI currently accounts for 0% of revenue, but that it could grow to 3.5% by 2027. AES shares have plunged roughly 13% since the start of the year amid a larger slide in utilities stocks. Morgan Stanley sees an upside of nearly 56% over the next 12 months, however. NextEra , the leading renewable developer in the U.S., is ""well-positioned"" to supply renewable power to new data centers, according to Morgan Stanley. The firm expects NextEra could go from incurring 0% of generative AI-driven revenue to 2.2% by 2027, especially given the company's geographic scale, competitive costs with its purchasing power, and its ability to integrate wind, solar, storage and software to optimize its services. Last week, NextEra reaffirmed its full-year guidance and posted a beat on quarterly earnings per share, excluding items. Morgan Stanley analysts think the stock can gain more than 30% from its latest closing price. Stocks supplying data center infrastructure Morgan Stanley also sees an opportunity for vendors that provide power management solutions like Delta Electronics and cable manufacturer Prysmian , which analyst Max Yates called a global grid play. ""As power demand grows, in order to reduce costs, we think customers will turn to IT equipment such as Delta's to support power efficiency and for reliable backup power,"" analyst Sharon Shih said. She pointed to Delta's InfraSuite software product, which optimizes critical device monitoring in data centers. Other stocks that stand to benefit from data center infrastructure needs of data center are real estate investment trust company Prologis , which is set to build out between $7 billion and $8 billion worth of data centers over the next five years, and Mitsubishi Electric , which builds a variety of products and systems for data centers related to air conditioning, energy savings and other functions. Apart from data center infrastructure and power providers, utilities are another part of the data center servicing ecosystem. But it's the only business model that is not reliant on power demand for its growth, Morgan Stanley analysts said, as the power needed for generative AI is largely relative to the size of power providers, which are often small companies. Analysts noted that regulated utility companies, such as Dominion Energy , provide power infrastructure at a ""massive scale, and data center power needs are still going to be a small part of utility capex budgets.""",2/1/2024,0,0.013112484,0.926769435,0.001916724,0.047381815,0.009015318,0.001804283

So far, more than 14% of S & P 500 companies have reported. Of those companies, 73.6% have beaten earnings expectations, FactSet data shows. Here's a look at some of the biggest reports of the week and what analysts think — along with a look at potential implications for the broader market. Investment banks doing well, BofA not so much The major banks that posted results this week — Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and Bank of America — beat earnings expectations. Nonetheless, that didn't translate into a positive stock reaction for all three of them. Bank of America shares fell more than 3% despite the company beating on both top and bottom lines. Net interest income, a key metric of how much money a bank makes from loans, was $14.19 billion, above the $13.93 billion StreetAccount estimate. However, net interest income was lower on a yearly basis. Finance chief Alastair Borthwick also told analysts during a post-earnings conference call that net interest income will likely decline in the second quarter due to drops in wealth management, before potentially rebounding later in 2024. To be sure, Wells Fargo's Mike Mayo said Bank of America's first-quarter results were ""not too surprising"" and benefited from improved capital market conditions. He remains confident in the bank's reputation, deposits and credit quality in relation to its big bank peers. ""Overall, BAC is a Goliath at a time when Goliath is winning,"" Mayo wrote in a Tuesday note. Mayo has an overweight rating on Bank of America. BAC 5D mountain BAC 5-day chart Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley shares climbed around 3% and 2.5% each following their earnings announcements. For the week, they are up 3.7% and 6%, respectively. Analysts from JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo all raised their price targets on Goldman following its positive results. Wells Fargo's Mayo said the firm is ""likely best-of-breed"" among its peers. The bank's pivot away from commercial banking into a renewed emphasis on its asset and wealth management segments is a positive for Goldman, per Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala. He named Goldman as one of the best names to own thanks to its exposure to a broader uptick in investment banking activity, as well as secular trends including more financing opportunities for artificial intelligence projects and a growth in private credit. Mayo prefers Goldman over Morgan Stanley, for which he holds an equal weight rating on shares. The company posted a growth in wealth inflows and revenue. However, Mayo remains concerned about the flat NII in the wealth segment, keeping him on the sidelines. UnitedHealth crushes estimates, but cyberattack still an overhang UnitedHealth's results easily exceeded analyst expectations, sending shares soaring more than 14%. That would be its biggest weekly gain since April 2020, when it rallied 15%. However, management noted the ongoing fallout of the cyberattack on its subsidiary Change Healthcare will result in an impact on full-year earnings of between $1.15 and $1.35 per share. ""So while core MLR [medical loss ratio] in Q1 was slightly higher than expected, the outlook for the year seems largely inline with expectations, alleviating investor concerns around runaway medical cost trends and the risk from that to EPS,"" Deutsche analyst George Hill said in a Thursday note. He reiterated his buy rating on the stock, and slightly increased his price target to $562 from $545. UNH 5D mountain UNH 5-day chart Netflix concerns Netflix had a strong start to 2024 across the board, but its weaker-than-expected full-year revenue outlook weighed on sentiment. The streaming service also announced it would stop reporting quarterly subscriber numbers — a key metric watched by traders ahead of the report — and average revenue per membership starting next year. Shares fell on Friday more than 8% and were headed for their worst day since July 2023. ""Overall, NFLX's 1Q was very clean, but we'd expect pushback from the 2024 revenue growth outlook, ongoing concerns about slowdown of Paid Sharing benefits & advertising monetization, & valuation,"" JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth wrote in a Friday note. He reiterated his overweight rating and $650 price target on shares. Bank of America also remains bullish on shares. Analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich kept her buy rating and $700 price target, which she said is supported by its increased visibility in growth drivers and strength in innovation. Not all firms were as optimistic, however. Goldman Sachs retained its neutral rating on the stock, while Canaccord Genuity downgraded shares to hold from buy on slower forecasted growth. The reduced subscriber disclosures ""add to uncertainty,"" the firm said. Mixed earnings picture Although nearly three-quarters of the reported earnings so far have topped expectations, the broader picture is more muddled. Profit growth is on track to disappoint, according to FactSet data. The blended earnings growth rate, which considers the reports already out and the estimates from those still pending, sits at just 0.16%. Analysts expected year-over-year profit expansion of more than 3% heading into the season, per FactSet. Revenue beats have also lagged earnings, with just 61% of companies exceeding top-line expectations. First-quarter results ""have been a mostly negative catalyst for large caps, with below-typical sales beat rates. Demand has come in lighter than expected, though 'higher-end' consumers remain resilient with record household wealth and cash balances,"" wrote Wells Fargo strategist Chris Harvey. He forecasts more downward revisions to forward guidance, versus raises, from the companies scheduled to report going forward.

What do Reddit , Trump Media & Technology Group and GameStop all have in common? They all have strong retail participation. Trump Media made its market debut on Tuesday under the ticker DJT, following its merger with shell company Digital World Acquisition Corp. The new business has a current market capitalization of about $9 billion A market cap of roughly $9 billion would put Trump Media on par with the names in the lower end of the S & P 500 , making it comparable to Caesars Entertainment , American Airlines and Mosaic . Reddit, which is not in the S & P 500, also has a market cap of about $9 billion Market capitalization Trump Media & Technology $9.4 b. Reddit $9.2 b. Caesars Entertainment $9.4 b. American Airlines $10 b. Mosaic $10.3 b. This is rather remarkable, considering Trump Media had revenues of roughly $3.3 million. The company lost $49 million in the first nine months of last year, according to The New York Times . GameStop, in comparison, had a small profit in its fiscal year , with revenues of $5.2 billion. The market cap is about $4 billion. Even if you think of these as meme stocks, this is quite a difference. GameStop has a small profit, revenues of $5.2 billion and a market cap of $4 billion. DJT has revenues of $3 million, loses money and has a market cap of $9.4 billion. GameStop makes Trump Media & Technology look like JPMorgan. Another stock that has been a high flier is Reddit, which has surprised everyone by almost doubling its initial public offering price of $34 within days of its debut, a reversal of the usual pattern in which high interest IPOs decline after their first trading session. Reddit has given an undetermined number of shares to its site moderators, who are part of its loyal user base. What meme stocks have in common What Trump Media, GameStop and Reddit have in common is a high retail base. That means there is a large base of individual investors rather than institutional. Retail investors tend to move more on emotion and are less concerned with old-school metrics like fundamental analysis, which attempts to determine what the correct price for a stock should be based on estimate of future profitability and dividends. Each of these three stocks has a user base with a strong attachment to the product or the founder. It doesn't mean that the laws of investing have been repealed. Fundamentals do matter When GameStop first exploded in early 2021, plenty of retail traders messaged to inform me that this proved that a dedicated, organized group could move a stock and that fundamentals don't matter. This, of course, is nonsense. A stock is a share of ownership in a company, entitling the stockholder to a claim on the company's earnings and assets. That is literally the definition of a stock. Fundamental analysis was developed as a way to make a guess at what that future stream of profits, including dividends, would look like. You can see this in the charter of the very first modern stock company, the Dutch East India Company, which began operations in 1602. The company was set up to import spices from the Moluccas in eastern Indonesia, but it quickly expanded. In its charter , the Dutch East India Company said that ownership would entitle shareholders to receive profits from the sale of spices. According to this document, whenever the cargo arrived in port, the company was required to provide ""a statement listing the goods received, and what the state the cargo is in. And what the proceeds received from sale of the merchandise are shall also be provided to the Provinces or cities, when they request this. … As soon as 5% of a return cargo has been cashed shall it be distributed to the participants."" Here, in the very first modern stock company, the owners tell you: You are buying our stock to participate in profits from the spice trade. Every company since then has made essentially the same promise: You're buying our stock to participate in the profits from the business we are in. Have the laws of investing been repealed? As for GameStop, it has been in a long, slow descent since mid-2021, going from roughly $75 ( split adjusted in July 2022) to about $13 after the company reported disappointing sales this week. Almost every single person who has bought GameStop in the last three years is in the red. Looking out on the future of the gaming retailer, Michael Pachter of Wedbush, one of only two analysts who cover GameStop, noted that the company was continuing to see sales decline due to falling hardware sales, fewer large console releases and the growth of video game subscription services. The retailer is not in imminent danger of going under, but Pachter noted, ""If we're right, GameStop has a likely runway of no more than five years. The demise of GameStop is outside the 12- month window we use for our price target, but we expect the company's demise at some point later this decade."" What's it all mean? Back in the 1990s, we often had a man named Arch Crawford on our air. He gave investing advice based on astrology — I kid you not. If the stars and planets were properly aligned, it might be the right time to buy Microsoft. You might be surprised to hear that he had a following. If enough people decide they want to invest on astrology or sunspots or on the personality of a single man— or they just want to HODL and believe the stock will do well — it might be possible to move the stock, and leave everyone scratching their heads. But eventually, the story crumbles. Fundamentals do matter.

But one of its top shareholders has revealed why they've been selling the stock. Jennison Associates, the 15th largest shareholder of Nvidia, was an early investor in the chipmaker and currently holds $7 billion worth of shares, or 0.57% of the company. That's down from a peak of 0.95% in the last quarter of 2022, according to LSEG data. Raj Shant, managing director at Jennison Associates, told CNBC Pro that the investment firm has been selling its position in the AI chip maker to manage risk despite remaining optimistic about its long-term prospects. ""We emphasize risk management much more than many growth investors,"" Shant told CNBC Pro. He explained that Nvidia had quickly increased to nearly 10% of Jennison Associates' Global Equity Opportunities strategy due to the stock's 238% rise in 2023, which necessitated selling the stock to bring its allocation back to around 6%. ""We're actually no less optimistic than we were, but we're [also] not more optimistic than we were then,"" he added. When should investors sell growth stocks? When asked about the right time to sell a growth company like Nvidia, Shant pointed to the firm's latest research note titled ""Buy and Hold Forever?"" It explains when the investment firm would sell a position: either to buy shares in more attractive growth stock, to take profits, or if the fundamentals change. ""We are not satisfied holding a company — even if it is successful — if we believe there are more attractive opportunities available,"" the note said. Shant stressed that as long-term investors, short-term volatility wouldn't trigger a sell signal at Jennison. The chipmaking giant's stock briefly entered correction territory after shares fell 10% last week from their most recent all-time closing high. NVDA 1Y line Instead, the former fund manager said fundamentals, such as insufficient growth, are more significant drivers of Jennison's triggers to abandon a stock. He also cautioned that the reason behind an earnings disappointment is likely to be more important than the disappointment itself in evaluating an investment's future. ""When you look at disappointments, you have to look: is it demand … or is it supply? [As in] they can't actually make enough to meet expectations in that quarter,"" Shant told CNBC's Squawk Box Friday. ""One is very negative for the medium-term investment thesis, but the other is generally temporary, transitory and can generally be fixed with good management."" Shant cited the example of companies like Nvidia, which he said could be laying the foundation of a whole new industry in generative AI, and obesity drug companies like Novo Nordisk , which Jennison Associates also has positions in. He explained that when these types of companies are growing fast and disrupting whole industries, there is a risk that orders start to slip or fade in a particular quarter. ""But actually, more likely, is that they can't make enough,"" to meet demand, Shant said. ""There comes a quarter where they don't deliver as much as the analysts are expecting."" Shant believes long-term investors should overlook such bumps. Is it time to buy Nvidia now? When asked if he would buy Nvidia's stock right now, Shant shied away from providing investment advice but expressed confidence in the company's medium-term prospects. ""If you're willing and able to close your eyes and not fret about the week-to-week or month-to-month over the next year or two? Yes. Will it outperform the market? Yes,"" he said. Jennison Associates' Global Equity Opportunities strategy, which holds about 35 stocks, significantly outperformed the MSCI AC World Index in 2023, returning 41.6% compared to the index's 22.2%. Nvidia remains the strategy's second-largest holding, with a 6.1% allocation. Despite Jennison Associates trimming its position, other institutional investors have been buying shares of Nvidia. Norges Bank, which manages the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, invested in the company during the fourth quarter of 2023 and now owns Nvidia shares valued at about $15 billion. Other notable investors in Nvidia include Morgan Stanley and Barclays, which also increased their stake throughout last year's second half and now own shares worth billions.",4/15/2024,-2,0.008230384,0.934935212,0.001928417,0.039825357,0.013027105,0.002053553

Apple added 2.4% after Evercore ISI advised clients buy last week's dip. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) jumped 3.5% for its best day since November.

This week, traders may gain greater clarity into the path of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.

The Nasdaq led the pack with a 6.12% gain. The S&P 500 climbed 5.17%, while the Dow added 2.22% for its first four-month winning streak since May 2021.

The Nasdaq's climb to a record arrives at a time when enthusiasm over artificial intelligence has lifted a swath of major tech stocks – and the broader markets – through 2023 and into this year. The ""Magnificent 7,"" which includes Alphabet , Amazon , Apple , Meta Platforms , Microsoft , Nvidia and Tesla , have led the Nasdaq's recovery from a rocky 2022 that was marred by rising interest rates and recession fears.

Indeed, chip names were among the standouts in Thursday's rally, with Advanced Micro Devices popping more than 9% and the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) closing higher by 2.2%.

Data released on Thursday showed the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation was stubbornly above the central bank's target in January, but at least didn't exceed Wall Street forecasts. There were also signs that consumer spending remains robust.

The core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, increased 0.4% for the month and 2.8% from a year ago. That matches Dow Jones estimates. Headline PCE, which includes food and energy categories, increased 0.3% monthly and 2.4% on a 12-month basis, compared to respective estimates for 0.3% and 2.4%.

""This morning's data is a sigh of relief for bulls, who were worried inflation was going to reaccelerate and cause the Fed to put off rate cuts for a much longer time,"" said Independent Advisor Alliance chief investment officer Chris Zaccarelli. ""At least for today, it should be all systems go and buyers should re-emerge.""

Personal income rose 1% month-over-month in January, well above the forecast for 0.3%.

Meanwhile, pending home sales posted a surprise drop in January amid swings in mortgage rates. Pending sales declined 4.9% for the month, much worse than the 2% projected increase from the Dow Jones consensus.

A live stream of the event also be made available to members here , beginning at 1:30 p.m. ET. Economic data : The main event of the week comes Thursday morning with the release of the January personal spending and income report. The key line time in the report is the core personal consumption expenditures price index, or core PCE — the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. As of Friday, economists forecast the PCE, excluding food and energy, increased 2.8% in January on a year-over-year basis, according to estimates compiled FactSet, which would represent a nice deceleration from the 2.9% rate we saw in December. This month's release will likely be even more closely scrutinized than usual due to last week's hotter-than-expected consumer and producer price index reports, which stoked fears about a rekindling of inflation. A day earlier, we'll get the second read of the fourth-quarter 2023 gross domestic product index. The report is backward looking, but is still important because it provides insight into how the economy held up into year-end. That, in turn, will shed light on whether the Fed has interest rates at an appropriate level between 5.25% and 5.5% and whether the U.S. central bank is right to hold them steady a bit longer. The market currently expects the first Fed rate cut at its June policy meeting, according to the CME FedWatch . The two other reports of note are the January new home sales report on Monday and ISM Manufacturing report on Friday. The former will offer a look at the supply-and-demand picture and price dynamics in the housing market, a crucial issue for the economy as higher shelter costs remain a key factor holding overall inflation levels higher. The latter provides an update on the state of manufacturing (about 12% of U.S. GDP) across various industries. There is always valuable insight to be gleaned from the ""What Respondents Are Saying"" section of the report. Earnings: Although the pace of earnings is slowing down, we'll hear from TJX Companies before the open Wednesday and from Salesforce after the close Wednesday. TJX Companies : We're simply looking for more of what the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls parent delivered in the third quarter , including gross margin expansion on a year-over-year basis and same-store-sales coming in a bit above management's guidance for a 3% to 4% increase. We'll also be interested to hear about the merchandise environment and foot-traffic trends. Recall that January retail sales disappointed , a sign the consumer is feeling the pressure of inflation and higher rates. Shoppers placing an increased focus on value, while still wanting quality products, should bode well for TJX Companies; we'll be looking for management to confirm that belief during the conference call. Salesforce : The focus is still on management's ability to appropriately balance growth and profitability.

413,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/07/jake-paul-to-fight-mike-tyson-in-boxing-match-streamed-live-on-netflix.html,NFLX,Netflix,Jake Paul to fight Mike Tyson in boxing match streamed live on Netflix,"Netflix is coming out swinging in the world of live sports.

Mike Tyson, the scandal-plagued former heavyweight champion, will go head to head with the YouTuber-turned-fighter Jake Paul in a ""boxing mega-event"" that will stream live exclusively on Netflix on July 20, the entertainment giant announced Thursday.

Tyson and Paul are set to duke it out inside AT&T Stadium, an 80,000-seat capacity venue in Arlington, Texas, and the home of the National Football League's Dallas Cowboys, the company announced in a news release.

The event marks one of Netflix's most ambitious forays into both sports programming and live entertainment as it seeks to cement its status as the premiere at-home viewing destination in the United States, muscling aside traditional players in broadcast and cable.

The company recently reached a 10-year deal for the exclusive rights to stream World Wide Wrestling's weekly flagship show, ""Raw,"" starting in January 2025. The headline-grabbing deal was valued at more than $5 billion, according to a company filing cited by CNBC.

""I'm very much looking forward to stepping into the ring with Jake Paul at the AT&T STADIUM IN ARLINGTON, TEXAS,"" Tyson said in a statement accompanying the Netflix announcement, capitalized words and all.

""He's grown significantly as a boxer over the years, so it will be a lot of fun to see what the will and ambition of a 'kid' can do with the experience and aptitude of a GOAT,"" Tyson added, using the acronym for ""Greatest of All Time.""

Tyson, who will be 58 when the Netflix fight streams, earned a reputation as one of the most ferocious boxers and incendiary personalities in modern professional sports.

He was the youngest heavyweight champion in history, at just 20 years old, and his prowess in the ring led him to a run of 37 consecutive victories — 33 of them by knockout, according to Netflix's summary of his career.

Tyson's life has also been defined by troubling behavior and legal woes. He was convicted of rape in 1992 and served three years in prison. In the ring, ""Iron Mike"" could be vicious, such as when he bit Evander Holyfield's right ear during an infamous 1997 bout.

Paul, 27, got his start as an early internet influencer, posting popular videos on the defunct platform Vine and cultivating a large following on YouTube. He pivoted to boxing in 2018 and turned pro in 2020, and he now has a 9-1 record that includes six knockouts.

""It's crazy to think that in my second pro fight, I went viral for knocking out Nate Robinson on Mike Tyson's undercard,"" Paul said in a statement. ""Now, less than four years later, I'm stepping up to face Tyson myself to see if I have what it takes to beat one of boxing's most notorious fights and biggest icons.""

The livestreamed fight is the result of a partnership between Netflix and Most Valuable Promotions, a company co-founded by Paul and Nakisa Bidarian in 2021 with ""the mission to provide more creative control to fighters,"" according to Netflix's news release.

Netflix established its sport content bonafides with the documentary franchise ""Untold"" as well as series such as ""Formula 1: Drive to Survive,"" ""NASCAR: Full Speed"" and ""Tour de France: Unchained."" The platform has hosted two live sports events to date: ""The Netflix Cup"" and ""The Netflix Slam.""",3/7/2024,2,0.020853402,0.017634854,0.001638748,0.946129858,0.012845539,0.000897539

Check out the latest calls and chatter below. All times ET. 8:18 a.m.: Truist Securities upgrades Procter & Gamble to buy Truist thinks Procter & Gamble shares have room to run as the consumer goods manufacturer nears an inflection point for volume growth. Analyst Davis Holcombe upgraded shares to buy from hold and raised his 12-month price target by $15 to $175. That number implies the stock could gain 9.1% from Friday's closing price. The upgrade is ""based on our belief that PG shares will outperform peers based on improving volume numbers and a normalized macro environment highlighting the company's strength,"" Holcombe wrote in a Monday note. According to the analyst, Procter & Gamble is a quarter or two from posting volume growth, which he believes will be a catalyst for shares and allow the company to differentiate itself from the overall group of consumer packaged goods stocks, which he expects to continue facing volume declines. — Pia Singh 8 a.m.: Bank of America asks 'What's not to like?' about upcoming General Electric spinoff General Electric is set to maintain its position as industry leader despite its upcoming spinoff, according to Bank of America.

Citing ""strong demand and execution"" the analyst also kept his $175 price objective, implying that shares could move up 4% from here.

""Apart from the strong culture, GE is set to capture robust demand with the LEAP engine in narrowbodies and the GEnx in widebodies,"" he wrote. And while General Electric has a dominating position in its field, the analyst also pointed out the firm is still making active efforts at improvement. ""GE finds itself in a prime position across commercial and defense markets with strong demand for OEM and aftermarket, GE is not resting on its laurels,"" he said.

""Buy the AI scare,"" he said. Thill reiterated his buy rating and $700 price target, which implies about 26.9% upside for the stock. Adobe's shares are down 7.5% this year, hit by the release of OpenAI's new text-to-video AI generator, Sora, that many traders saw as a threat to Adobe's business model in the creative software market. Thill, however, disagrees that this threat would be long term, forecasting a first-quarter earnings beat and positive metrics on Adobe Firefly's AI adoption—and eventually expecting Adobe to return as a ""top beneficiary of AI."" — Pia Singh 7:12 a.m.: Nvidia, Western Digital among Morgan Stanley's top AI picks Morgan Stanley's recent Technology, Media & Telecom conference reinforced investors' high levels of interest in artificial intelligence, and that some areas of the industry are going through a ""bottoming process."" Analyst Joseph Moore said he continues to be positive on AI stock picks, and named Nvidia , Western Digital and Microchip Technology as his favored names coming out of the conference. Computer drive manufacturer Western Digital is the firm's top pick. Moore noted that the company posted higher revenue and earnings guidance, and that the company's NAND business will retain its ""significant value proposition"" given that the CEO will remain with that side of the company. Western Digital had announced in late October that it will split its hard disk drive and NAND memory businesses into two separate public companies. — Pia Singh 7:11 a.m.: Morgan Stanley downgrades Petrobras shares after the oil company cut its dividend Morgan Stanley has moved to the sidelines on Bazilian petroleum company Petrobras . Analyst Bruno Montanari lowered his price target by $2 to $18, suggesting about 21.8% potential upside for the stock, which is trading 0.8% higher in premarket trading. Shares are down more than 7% so far this year. ""We downgrade PBR shares to equal-weight from overweight as we have lower confidence in additional shareholder returns via extraordinary dividends in the near term, leaving the risk-reward proposition more balanced,"" Montanari wrote in a Friday note. ""The PBR positioning has been mostly driven by the company's compelling valuation relative to major oil stocks, which is no longer the case."" Petrobras plunged 11.5% on Friday after the company's quarterly results reflected a lower-than-expected regular dividend, disappointing investors. Given the stock's more-than-72% return over the past 12 months, the analyst said he is waiting to see more evidence that the company's capital remuneration account will be used to fund more dividends in future quarters. — Pia Singh 6:29 a.m.: Duolingo initiated at overweight by JPMorgan JPMorgan's Bryan Smilek initiated coverage of online learning platform Duolingo at an overweight rating, forecasting ""premium"" revenue growth ahead. ""Duolingo's freemium strategy, product obsession, & social-first marketing strategy have driven its industry-leading scale, strong brand reputation, & highly efficient acquisition (~90% of user growth organic),"" Smilek wrote in a Monday note. ""We believe DUOL is well-positioned to deliver sustainable 20%+ Bookings/Revenue growth."" Smilek's $270 price target implies the stock can gain about 26.4% over the next year. Shares are down 5.9% year to date, but are still up 11.4% over the past month after the company surpassed fourth-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The stock added 1.1% in premarket trading Monday. DUOL YTD mountain DUOL year to date Smilek expects Duolingo — which has 6.6 million paid subscribers — to see deeper monetization and paid subscription growth, projecting paid subscribers to double to 12.3 million by 2026. His bull case is also encouraged by the company's use of generative AI to enhance its products and cut costs. — Pia Singh 6:06 a.m.: Morgan Stanley downgrades Hyatt to equal weight, cites 'balanced risk-reward' Morgan Stanley is confident in Hyatt's continued performance after the hotel chain's strong fourth-quarter performance, but thinks shares could be overvalued. Analyst Stephen Grambling downgraded Hyatt to equal weight from overweight and lowered his price target by $7 to $149. That suggests shares could edge lower by about 0.4%. Shares are up about 20.2% year to date. ""The pivot to asset light and simplification of the business model has driven outperformance, leaving a more balanced risk-reward,"" Grambling wrote in a Monday note, noting the stock's three-month run-up. ""We continue to appreciate the underlying story and see substantial proceeds from asset sales still driving best in-class FCF/share growth."" Hyatt reported a beat on quarterly earnings on Feb. 23, posting earnings of 64 cents per share, excluding items, while analysts polled by FactSet had called for earnings of 38 cents per share. Grambling's 2024 EBITDA estimates are near the top end of consensus guidance, largely reflecting higher royalty and licensing fees offsetting incremental asset sales, he said. — Pia Singh 5:44 a.m.: Netflix shares could gain nearly 20% from here, according to Oppenheimer Oppenheimer is more bullish on Netflix , citing the streaming giant's ability to grow its long-term subscriber base. Analyst Jason Helfstein reiterated his outperform rating and raised his price target on shares by $110 to $725, which suggests roughly 19.9% potential upside from Friday's close. Shares of Netflix have jumped more than 24% this year. NFLX YTD mountain NFLX year to date ""We believe NFLX's initiatives such as password sharing rules, advertising and optimizing subscriber plan choices will drive subscriber growth and average revenue per membership (ARM), therefore leading to higher revenue,"" Helfstein wrote in a Sunday note. ""We believe NFLX's dominance will continue, given its clear advantage in producing high-engagement content and monetizing that content more effectively than peers."" The analyst estimated a high likelihood of subscriber additions beating Wall Street's estimates in the future, given forecasts assume a major slowdown in paid sharing and ad-tier subscriptions. Helfstein sees subscribers being 17 million higher than the consensus over the next three years as competition in streaming eases with other streaming platforms prioritizing profitability — while Netflix acquires more content and retains its dominant market share in U.S. television viewership. — Pia Singh 5:44 a.m.: Bernstein sticking by Taiwan Semiconductor Taiwan Semiconductor shares are off to a strong start for the year, and Bernstein expects them to continue doing well. Analyst Mark Li reiterated his outperform rating on the stock, calling for stronger gross margins, especially in the second half of the year. ""While many worry about 2H24 margins, we expect an HoH improvement. Our 2025 & 2026 gross margin (GM) forecast is also above consensus,"" Li wrote. ""Many now expect TSMC's GM to dip HoH and they attribute the 3-4% drag from 3nm and 1-2% drag for capacity sharing between 5nm & 3nm. We agree the 1-2% drag is incremental from 1H24 to 2H24, but in the 2Q23 earnings call (link) TSMC guided 4Q23 also had 3-4% drag from 3nm too."" ""We agree TSMC may not enjoy much operating leverage from depreciation, as TSMC guided its 2024 depreciation will be up close to 30% YoY, slightly faster the growth of low- to mid-20s% in revenue this year. However labor cost certainly won't rise as fast as revenue. ... Hence instead of a dip, we project TSMC's GM to rise to 53.5-54.6% in 2H24."" U.S.-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor are up a whopping 40.7% year to date. The firm raised its price target on them to $150 from $125, implying upside of just 2%. However, it also increased its forecast on Taiwan-listed shares, calling for a 15% increase over the next 12 months. — Fred Imbert",3/11/2024,-2,0.017641485,0.791728735,0.003678108,0.161141127,0.022356015,0.00345449

The Nasdaq Composite finally soared to a record high last Friday, making it the last of the three major stock indexes to hit the milestone in 2024. Now, traders have diverted their attention to the Federal Reserve as they await signs that the market has the momentum to continue its rally. But for some stocks in the Nasdaq, their ascent may soon come to an end. We used the CNBC Pro Stock Screener to search for names in the Nasdaq 100 , made up of the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks in the Nasdaq Composite, that could be due for a sell-off soon. To do this, we selected stocks that are up at least 40% in the past 12 months but have an analyst consensus price target that calls for at least a 1% pullback in the next year. One name on the list was streaming platform service Netflix , which is up 96% in the past year. However, analysts covering the stock see it falling nearly 7% in the near future. In January, Seaport Research Partners downgraded the name to a neutral rating from buy. While the company has good fundamentals, the firm thinks shares are now trading near their fair value. ""We are downgrading our recommendation on NFLX shares to Neutral from Buy, having rapidly achieved our recently-increased $576 PT,"" wrote analyst David Joyce. ""Various valuation metrics relative to growth expectations through 2027 appear to be rather full."" Another name that could sell off soon is semiconductor manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices . The stock has rallied roughly 150% this past year, but could potentially fall 7%, according to average analyst estimates. Raymond James downgraded the name to outperform from a strong buy rating in January, citing elevated artificial intelligence revenue expectations. Analyst Srini Pajjuri's price target of $195, up from $190, suggests nearly 4% downside from Friday's close. Northland Capital Markets underscored the same reasons when it downgraded the stock in January to a market perform rating from outperform.

Next week will spotlight the bulk of the Magnificent Seven names, which had a strong start to the year, but have been in a slump as of late. Tesla reports Tuesday, Meta Platforms is out Wednesday. Thursday serves a double whammy with Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft . But those results are coming at a time when investors are on edge, uncertain where markets are heading after a pushback in rate cut expectations, a recent rise in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, as well as a spike in Treasury yields. On Friday, the S & P 500 was more than 5% off its 52-week high; it also dipped below 5,000, a level the broader index had only reached for the first time ever in February. Wall Street is hoping next week's megacap tech results will give investors insight into where the artificial intelligence trade is going from here, as a bounce in tech could lift the indexes. They're also hoping a slew consumer commentary will give investors insight into the state of the economy. ""Every week of earnings is the most pivotal one, but I really think this one is the most pivotal one,"" said Kim Forrest, founder at Bokeh Capital, adding, ""I think everybody is like me looking to next week thinking, 'This will be the time where we can figure out the direction of the market.'"" On Friday, the S & P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite registered losing weeks. Further gains, or buying opportunity? As a whole, the bar is high for the Magnificent Seven, even as there are increasing divergences between the names. Tesla, for example, will be in the spotlight next week. Investors are hoping for some positive news out of electric vehicle maker, which is the second-worst performer in the S & P 500 this year as it contends with slowing sales and rising competition from China. This week, Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock to hold from buy following a Reuters report of the possible scrapping of a low-cost car. In response, CEO Elon Musk said Reuters was ""lying."" Shares were down 14% this week. Investors a sense of how artificial intelligence will be monetized, seeking insight into growing Google's cloud business , as well as Microsoft's Copilot chatbot. ""These will give us some of the best indications of AI demand,"" said Emily Leveille, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, adding, ""We expect earnings, I think, to be pretty good for at least for Microsoft and for Meta, just considering sort of recent momentum in earnings growth."" Horizon Investments' Scott Ladner urged caution ahead of the reports given the high expectations swirling around the megacaps. However, he said any pullback in the tech names could give investors an opening to start ""nibbling away"" at additional exposure. While the investment chief anticipates further volatility over the next several weeks, he said he anticipates stocks can again rise over the intermediate term, and gain another 10% from here. ""Especially with the AI trade, those expectations have been ramped up. And so, we would probably be a little bit cautious in terms of getting exposure to those names ahead of earnings releases because that bar is quite high,"" Ladner said. ""But if we do get a sell-off associated with those releases that don't hit up on those raised expectations, it probably is, we think, a better buying opportunity than a selling opportunity at that point,"" Ladner added. He also advised investors to start adding exposure to other interesting assets such as in Europe, or in small caps, which could jump after the central bank cuts rates later this year. Consumer focus Wall Street is also anticipating commentary from consumer-facing companies next week that could give insight into the state of the economy. Investors are hoping that consumer spending, which has thus far held up the economy in the face of higher prices, remains robust. Earnings results from Visa, for example, will be on deck. ""From a sentiment standpoint, consumers don't feel very good, but they haven't acted like that for the better part of years,"" Horizon's Ladner said. ""So, the bigger thing that we've been looking for and look for this quarter, is, are the consumers still acting like they're in good shape? Even if they feel a little bit down in the dumps because they don't like the price that they're paying for things, are they are they still paying those prices? Are they still borrowing? Are they still consuming?"" ""So long as that is continues to be the case, which we expect it to be, we think this consumer-facing company is probably going to have a pretty good rebound in the second half of the year,"" Ladner added. On the economic front, next week will also bring the first-quarter gross domestic product number. Economists polled by FactSet are anticipating the U.S. economy will have expanded by 3.1%, in line with the prior reading. Week ahead calendar All times ET.

Tiger Woods and TaylorMade have made it official. The golf great has agreed to create a new apparel and footwear performance and lifestyle brand with the Carlsbad, California company following his recent split with Nike . The brand, Sun Day Red, will be available first only online beginning in May. ""Life changes and this is an important transition and I wanted to have a brand that I was proud of going forward,"" Tiger said. Woods says the name of the brand ""Sun Day Red"" pays homage to the fact that he's always worn red on Sundays. The tiger logo is a tribute to the 15 majors he has worn over the course of his career. TaylorMade and Woods announced the news Monday night during a press event in Pacific Palisades, California, ahead of the PGA Tour's Genesis Invitational, an event he hosts. ""It's the right time,"" Woods said, appearing in a cashmere sweater from the new brand.

Woods' relationship with TaylorMade dates back to 2017, when the two signed an equipment deal that has him playing with the brand's driver, fairway woods, irons and wedges. Woods said he was courted by other companies but he trusted TaylorMade for their ability to ""get it right.""



TaylorMade CEO David Abeles said Woods had been an inspiration for his team, including his discipline and meticulous approach to product design.



The new brand includes an entirely new company with separate headquarters and employees who are solely focused on its development, Abeles said. ""There is no influence from TaylorMade on this brand. His brand stands alone and is independent from TaylorMade,"" Abeles said.

Last month, Woods announced his split from longtime apparel partner Nike after 27 years. Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, told CNBC at the time that the golfer made the business decision not to renew with Nike. The 15-time majors winner's brand exposure today is less than it once was at the height of his career. Woods has been plagued with a series of injuries following his 2021 car crash near Los Angeles, in which he suffered multiple leg injuries. Since then, the 48-year-old has made rare appearances at major golf tournaments, and his play has been unsteady. Yet, the deal is still a major win for TaylorMade. Woods still has a lasting legacy, experts say, and continues to draw massive crowds as fans hope to catch a glimpse of one of the greatest golfers of all time. ""Michael Jordan is still Michael Jordan, and Air Jordans still do very well,"" said Eric Smallwood, president of Apex Marketing Group, invoking the basketball Hall of Famer for comparison. Apex has tracked Woods' brand exposure over the course of his career. Smallwood said the golfer's TaylorMade deal will be a ""huge lift"" for its brand.",2/12/2024,2,0.001824661,0.986422837,0.001885169,0.008278411,0.001219927,0.000369031

Tiger Woods' 27-year partnership with Nike has come to an end. The superstar golfer announced the news in a statement Monday on social media platform X.

""Phil Knight's passion and vision brought this Nike and Nike Golf partnership together and I want to personally thank him, along with the Nike employees and incredible athletes I have had the pleasure of working with along the way,"" Woods wrote.

Mark Steinberg, Woods' longtime agent, told CNBC that the golfer made a business decision to not renew with Nike.

The announcement came after months of speculation that the two would break up. Nike confirmed the news on Instagram with a picture of Woods in his iconic red polo, saying, ""It was a hell of a run.""

In a statement, the company said: ""For over 27 years, we have had the honor to partner with Tiger Woods, one of the greatest athletes the world has ever seen. Throughout the course of our partnership, we have witnessed along with the rest of the world, how Tiger not only redefined the sport of golf, but broke barriers for all of sport. We watched him set records, challenge conventional thinking and inspire generations of people around the globe. We are grateful to have been a part of it. We wish him the best in the future.""

There's no word yet on Woods' plans for a future endorsement deal, but he said on social media, ""There will certainly be another chapter.""

Some recent speculation about Woods' next chapter have pointed to On Running, the Swiss brand that tennis great Roger Federer joined in 2019 after he left Nike.

Marc Maurer, co-CEO of On Running, addressed the speculation Monday at the ICR Conference in Orlando. ""We also heard the rumors, so it's always interesting what's out there. We hope that Tiger finds a great new partner and it's not going to be us,"" he said.

Golf club and equipment maker TaylorMade, which Woods, 48, has used since 2017, could be another potential landing spot for the 15-time major winner. On Monday, though, TaylorMade said their relationship is for equipment only and has no additional comment on the matter.

Analysts aren't expecting a big effect with the news as the rumors have been circulating about Woods' departure for months.

""We continue to believe the company has endorsements with some of the biggest name athletes in the world and we would expect that trend to continue for the foreseeable future,"" said Brian Yarbrough, a Nike analyst for Edward Jones.

Nike has been quietly ramping down on golf for years as it wasn't a huge money maker for the brand. In 2016, the Oregon sports apparel maker announced it would stop making golf equipment altogether.

Yet, Woods brought significant exposure to the Nike brand. Over the course of his career, Woods made a reported $500 million from ""the swoosh.""

Eric Smallwood, founder of Apex Marketing, estimates that when Woods goes four rounds, he's providing Nike with $2 million to $4 million of exposure.

Likewise, when Woods swapped his Nikes for FootJoy shoes at the 2023 Masters, he gave the brand $3.2 million of exposure.

Woods provides even more exposure for Nike than even LeBron James due to the pace of play of golf compared to basketball, Smallwood said. ""Golfers have longer longevity,"" he said.

Despite reporting better than expected earnings, investors sold Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) after earnings on the back of an uncertain outlook and guidance. With defense stocks trading closer to their 52-week lows, I believe that this presents an attractive risk/reward opportunity to potentially add some of these defense stocks to your portfolio. For the past year, NOC has largely traded within a range from $430 to $480 and its recent earnings announcement triggered a slide to the lows. The stock has since bounced off those lows and starting to show strength and now looks to close the gap at $463 before potentially reaching the $480 top of the trading range. Currently, analysts are expecting about 6% EPS growth this year on the back of 5% revenue growth, which is modest. However, this is reflected in the valuation at 18 times forward earnings. NOC is inexpensive relative to both itself and the market. With these types of valuations, the downside is limited, and the upside remains sizable, especially given the propensity for defense stocks to outperform during escalations of war. The biggest risk to NOC is its ability to navigate supply chain costs and budget overruns, which recently dented its recent quarter earnings. The trade The implied volatility rank on NOC is currently sitting at 23%, which indicates that options are neither cheap nor expensive. In these scenarios, my preference is to own the upside by purchasing options but using a vertical spread structure to reduce my overall risk and capital required. I'm buying to open the March 22 $450/$475 call vertical at $8.15 Debit. This means that I am: Buying March 22 $450 Calls @ $10.85 Debit Selling March 22 $475 Calls @ $2.70 Credit This strategy would risk a total of $815 per contract if NOC is below $450 on the March 22 expiration and potentially gain $1,685 per contract if NOC is above $475 at expiration.

Nvidia is currently valued at more than $2.2 trillion, powered partially by the tech industry's artificial intelligence boom and high demand for its computer chips. But in 1996, it was three years old, facing layoffs and close to going out of business as a contract with a major partner — video game company Sega — fell apart.

Huang's strategy to keep Nvidia afloat involved a rare amount of humility for a CEO, he told graduating students in a May 2023 commencement speech at National Taiwan University: ""At Nvidia, I [have] experienced failures. Great big ones — all humiliating and embarrassing.""

As part of the Sega contract, Nvidia needed to make chips for rendering 3D graphics on gaming consoles, Huang explained. The contract was a big deal for the young business and it essentially ""funded our company,"" he added.

The company took an experimental approach to that goal, building low-cost chips that diverged from the rest of the industry's software standards. ""After one year of development, we realized our architecture was the wrong strategy. It was technically poor,"" Huang said.

Worse, during that period, Microsoft rolled out its DirectX software interface, which became a standard for gaming platforms — and it wasn't compatible with Nvidia's chips.

""If we completed Sega's game console, we would have built inferior technology, [been] incompatible with Windows and be too far behind to catch up,"" Huang said. ""But we would be out of money if we didn't finish the contract. Either way, we would be out of business.""

Huang decided at the time that the best course of action would be to come clean with Sega, and tell that company to find another partner. At the same time, he noted, ""I needed Sega to pay us in whole, or Nvidia would be out of business.""

""I was embarrassed to ask,"" said Huang. ""The CEO of Sega, to his credit and my amazement, agreed. His understanding and generosity gave us six months to live.""

Sega bought out its Nvidia contract, and used chips from Imagine Technologies' PowerVR for its Dreamcast consoles. Huang used the money from the Sega contract to scrap Nvidia's initial efforts and to build a new chip — the RIVA 128 — that was compatible with DirectX.

The new chip supported higher graphic resolutions than its competitors, and Nvidia sold more than 1 million units in four months in 1997, marking the company's first hit product and turning around its fortunes.

It wasn't easy to admit Nvidia's mistake and humbly ask a client for understanding, Huang said: ""These traits are the hardest for the brightest and most successful, like yourself.""

He was also adamant that swallowing his pride was the right thing to do for his company.

""Confronting our mistake — and, with humility, asking for help — saved Nvidia,"" said Huang.

""People are reluctant to embrace this bull market after a couple of years of deep skepticism,"" the chief investment officer and senior portfolio manager at BD8 Capital Partners told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on March. 28. ""But this is what bull markets do. They make new highs. And of course, given the rapidity and speed with which we've gone up, it's normal to expect a pullback."" Boeing One of Doran's picks — Boeing — might come as a surprise. The aerospace giant has been grappling with a slew of manufacturing and quality issues. In January, a panel blow-out on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 led to increased scrutiny of the company, and the Federal Aviation Administration stepped up its oversight. Shares in Boeing have also taken a hit, sliding around 13% over the last 12 months and falling 28% year-to-date. ""I'd stayed away from the stock for a few years, but then it really seemed they were past ... the troubles. And really, the cash flow projections of 10 million in the [20]25/26 timeframe seem very attractive. And then, of course, the door blow off,"" she said. However, Doran says she now sees promise in the stock following announcements on an impending change in its senior management . According to Factset data, of 31 analysts covering the stock, 19 give it a buy or overweight rating. The average price target is $243.60, giving it around 30% potential upside. Nvidia A more popular name on Doran's list of stocks to watch is U.S. chipmaker Nvidia . The stock has dominated headlines over the past year and its shares logged an astronomical 240% rise in 2023. Its popularity shows little sign of abating, and although the stock is slightly lower over the past week, it is still up by more than 80% over the year to date. It has led some fund managers and analysts to say the stock now looks too expensive, although Doran is not concerned. ""Investors think it is over given its massive run,"" she wrote in notes to CNBC. ""But quarterly earnings a year ago were $.98 vs $5.51 estimated this quarter, a 460% increase. With a price-to-earnings of 37x this year and 29x next, the stock is attractive vs its growth rate."" FactSet data shows that 53 analysts have a buy or overweight rating on Nvidia, while 7 give it a hold rating. Analysts' average price target for the stock is $968.14, giving it around 8% potential upside. Starbucks Beyond the headline-makers, Doran is also a fan of coffee chain Starbucks . Calling it a ""largely discounted"" stock trading at 22 times forward earnings, the portfolio manager highlighted its branding, pricing, product innovation and cost savings of $3 billion over the next three years as areas of strength. She also sees the company benefitting from additional store openings. By 2030, the company plans to expand to 35,000 locations outside of North America ; as of Oct. 1 last year, it had roughly 20,200 international cafes. These developments come despite ""disappointing"" trends in China, according to Doran. However, she said she still sees promise as the ""premium luxury brand"" starts to open up more stores in the country. Shares in Starbucks are down around 14% over the past 12 months.

With the stock trading at a lofty 2.5% free cash flow (FCF) yield for next year, some investors are urging caution. Historically, Nvidia traded at a 4% FCF yield before the pandemic. Hannah Gooch-Peters, global equity investment analyst at Sanlam Investments, believes that Nvidia's current valuation is pricing in a continued and rapid increase in sales and profit. ""If you've got 75% gross margin, and it's a hardware company at the end of the day, you've got to ask yourself, what is the company's ability to sustain those gross margins?"" Gooch-Peters questioned Wednesday before CNBC Pro Talks ' live audience at London Business School. Gooch-Peters pointed to Visa — which has a 60% operating profit margin — as a more sustainable investment opportunity. ""What is the sustainability of that versus the sustainability of Nvidia's margins today when you're already pricing in a massive pull forward in demand?"" She explained that Visa also benefits from a powerful ""networking effect,"" the phenomenon in which the value of a product or service increases as more people use it. V NVDA 5Y line In Visa's case, the more banks, merchants, and consumers adopt its payment network, the more valuable and indispensable it becomes. This creates a strong competitive moat and helps to sustain the company's high profit margins over time. ""I think it really epitomizes a high quality company,"" Gooch-Peters added. Visa is a top-10 stock in Sanlam's Global High Quality equity fund, which manages more than $585 million in assets. The stock has risen by 7% this year, and analysts expect it to rise another 9.3% over the next 12 months. Gerry Fowler, chief European equity strategist at UBS, echoed the sentiment about the importance of a company's competitive moat while picking stocks. ""Visa is one of these companies that operates in an oligopolistic sector that seems to be very hard to break into,"" Fowler said. The UBS strategist pointed to the attempts of Apple, then the world's biggest company, to break into the payments network sector. Ultimately, Apple instead decided to use MasterCard as its payment network provider for its Apple Card service. ""There's lots of these sorts of attempts to break down that oligopolistic industry, but no one's done it yet,"" Fowler added. While Fowler acknowledged that Nvidia may also have a good position in the chip market because of the time it takes to develop and manufacture chips, he admitted that there is still a question of how to value the company's long-term growth prospects when AI's widespread use and implications are yet to be seen. The UBS strategist also cautioned that impenetrable moats might sometimes pose a downside risk to investors. Flower pointed to academic research suggesting that governments often take regulatory action when very large companies dominate their sectors and weaken competition to accrue monopolistic or oligopolistic benefits. Earlier this week, Visa and Mastercard entered into a $30 billion settlement with the U.S. government — one of the largest ever — to limit fees over the next five years.",4/1/2024,0,0.011693059,0.576613665,0.003467753,0.195720553,0.209511399,0.002993504

SK Hynix , one of the world's largest memory chipmakers, said it would invest $3.87 billion in its first chip packaging facility in the U.S., marking another victory for the Biden administration's efforts to onshore chip production.

The South Korean firm announced the West Lafayette, Indiana-based project at an event at Purdue University on Wednesday, with officials from Indiana State and the U.S. government in attendance.

SK Hynix said the facility, slated for operation in 2028, will house a production line for SK Hynix's cutting-edge high-bandwidth memory chips — important components in the Nvidia GPUs used to train AI systems like ChatGPT.

""We are excited to become the first in the industry to build a state-of-the-art advanced packaging facility for AI products in the United States,"" said SK Hynix CEO Kwak Noh-Jung in a statement, adding it would ""strengthen supply-chain resilience and develop a local semiconductor ecosystem.""

Technology stocks lifted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite into positive territory midday Thursday as investors bought into the dip from earlier in the week.

The S&P 500 gained 0.74% to close at 5,199.06. The Nasdaq Composite added 1.68% to end the day at 16,442.20, a record level. The Dow Jones Industrial Average underperformed and slipped 2.43 points, or 0.01%, at 38,459.08.

The S&P 500 jumped and the Nasdaq Composite closed at a record Thursday as tech shares climbed higher, rebounding from an earlier pullback over concerns of persistent inflation.

The Dow is on pace to end the week lower by 1.1%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 trimmed its earlier losses following a hot CPI report, and it is down just 0.1% week to date. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 1.2% for the week.

The producer price index reading for March came in below estimates, providing some relief after Wednesday's sell-off on a hot consumer prices report.

The health care developments at its 2024 GTC AI conference, — which also included the launch of roughly two dozen new AI-powered, healthcare-focused tools — demonstrate just how important medicine is to Nvidia's non-tech sector revenue opportunities in the future.

""The reason why Nvidia is so popular today is because it basically provided the plumbing and the technology for something that you could not do simply before or if you had to do something like this you would need probably several times more time, money and cost,"" said Raj Joshi, a technology analyst and senior vice president at Moody's Ratings. ""Health care, whether it's biotechnology, chemicals, or drug discovery is a very powerful area.""



Nvidia shares are up close to 100% year-to-date, and the biotech industry is an example of the untapped potential that investors are continue to bet on. AI can speed up the process of drug discovery and even find uses for drugs that may have failed to produce results for the initial disease they were developed to target.



""Over the last 18 months or so, we tend to believe it is more hope than hype because of the tangible outcomes and then the very compelling use cases how AI helped with the pharmaceutical industry, medtech industry or biotech industry,"" said Arda Ural, EY Americas health and life sciences industry market leader.

Drug development is a risky process that can take at least a decade from concept to clinical studies, Ural said. It's also a process that can cost billions, with a high chance of failure.

About 41 percent of biotech CEOs surveyed by EY in late 2023 said they were looking at ""concrete"" ways generative AI could be used for their companies. ""This is very high for my experience, having been 30 years in this industry,"" Ural said. ""This is a really unique feature we are seeing with AI that's being picked up much faster than other technologies.""



The health care focus from Nvidia at its conference was a doubling down on an ambition it's had for a long time. During an earnings call with investors in February, Nvidia mentioned several ways its technology was being adapted for the medical field. Companies like Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Generate: Biomedicines have been expanding their biomedical research with the help of hyperscale or GPU specialized cloud providers, and they need Nvidia AI infrastructure to facilitate the process.



""In healthcare, digital biology and generative AI are helping to reinvent drug discovery, surgery, medical imaging and wearable devices,"" said Colette Kress, Nvidia chief financial officer. ""We have built deep domain expertise in healthcare over the past decade, creating the NVIDIA Clara healthcare platform and NVIDIA BioNeMo, a generative AI service to develop, customize and deploy AI foundation models for computer-aided drug discovery.""

Last year, NVIDIA invested $50 million in Recursion for its drug discovery projects. Recursion is inputting its biological and chemical data to train NVIDIA's AI models on its cloud platform.

But many smaller firms along the global AI supply chain also stand to benefit. BofA said in a March 15 note that there's been a ""booming"" AI market with multiple AI solutions since the second half of 2023. Most chips are dependent on TSMC's production, with chip and integrated circuit designs being sourced globally or from Taiwan, and some components from Greater China, said BofA. ""The scarcity of AI/computing suppliers helps higher value-added and bargaining power, esp. for costly AI products,"" BofA analysts wrote. The bank named various parts of the supply chain that stand to benefit from AI, and its top stocks in each category. Server original design manufacturers Global firms have worked with Taiwanese manufacturers for highly customized projects, such as AI graphics processing units, the bank noted. These are BofA's top picks among such manufacturers or suppliers: Quanta : The investment bank says it's the top original design manufacturer and has a diversified client base. It has worked with Google for over a decade, thanks to its ability to produce highly customized server design, BofA noted. Wistron : A major graphics processing unit baseboard supplier, according to the bank. With rising AI server applications and GPU supply, it expects the AI server GPU baseboard business to account for 3% to 6% of Wistron's total sales in 2024 and 2025. That's up from 1% in 2023. Foxconn Industrial Internet: BofA noted it's a key partner to Microsoft and Nvidia through its subsidiary Ingrasys. It also noted that Foxconn Industrial Internet has been supporting Microsoft's OpenAI for years. Hardware tech Hardware tech such as printed circuit boards are the upstream parts of the AI server supply chain. These materials or components are ""always needed,"" BofA said. These are BofA's top picks in this space: Unimicron and NYPCB are ahead when it comes to tech and product development related to AI and high performance computing, BofA said. Unimicron, however, has been faster in ramping up AI-server related revenue, as is evident from its ""proven track record"" in producing printed circuit boards for Nvidia, according to the bank. Semiconductors BofA says chip design is getting more expensive, as it becomes more complex and the costs of developing the physical components grow. But because a more advanced technology is needed to build chips for AI applications, there's a ""growing reliance"" on companies with a ""solid track record"" for designing customized chips, the bank said. ""In our view, finding trustable IP and design service providers has become more crucial in the AI era, as the overall R & D investment becomes costlier and customers (chip-designer) shy away from the risk of failure,"" BofA analysts wrote. ""Overall, IP and design service represents a small part of the whole semiconductor market globally, but turns increasingly important since the chip performance is largely predicated on the quality of IP and chip-design."" Against this backdrop, the bank named Taiwanese stocks Alchip and eMemory as key beneficiaries. BofA also named MediaTek , a leading fabless company in Asia that is an indirect beneficiary of AI server trends. The bank says it sees ""strong upside"" for MediaTek as it expands its customized chips to hyperscalers. In addition, its partnership with Nvidia in automotive AI should widen its AI opportunities, BofA noted. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",3/27/2024,-2,0.00101406,0.996299922,0.000564526,0.001066492,0.000613091,0.000441918

Called Blackwell, the new GPU chips from Nvidia that power AI models require the latest third-generation memory chips, also known as high-bandwidth memory (HBM/HBM3E). The investment bank expects the total addressable market for HBM to expand tenfold to $23 billion by 2026, up from just $2.3 billion in 2022. The Wall Street bank sees three major memory makers as prime beneficiaries of the booming HBM market: SK Hynix , Samsung Electronics and Micron . All three stocks are also traded in the U.S., Germany, and U.K. Investors can also invest in the three stocks through exchange-traded funds. While Invesco Next Gen Connectivity ETF (KNCT) holds all three stocks in a highly concentrated manner, WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Fund (WTAI) has less than 2% allocation toward each. MU 1Y line Goldman Sachs said stronger AI demand was driving higher AI server shipment and greater memory chip density per GPU – the chip powering AI – leading them to ""meaningfully raise"" their estimates. Goldman analysts led by Giuni Lee said in a note to clients on March 22 that all three ""will benefit from the strong growth in the HBM market and the tight [supply/demand], as this is leading to a continued substantial HBM pricing premium and likely accretion to each company's overall DRAM margin."" Investors have been cautious about the memory market for AI systems since all three major suppliers are due to expand manufacturing capacity and add downward pressure on profit margins. However, Goldman analysts believe challenges like larger chip sizes and lower production yields for HBM compared with conventional DRAM memory chips are likely to keep supply tight in the near future. The Wall Street bank is not alone in its view. Citi analysts had also advised clients similarly in February.

These alternatives are expected to see huge earnings growth going forward,"There's a host of stocks that can still benefit from the artificial intelligence craze besides Nvidia , according to analysts. Nvidia's annual GTC Conference , dubbed ""AI Woodstock"" by Bank of America, on Monday will feature a keynote speech from CEO Jensen Huang and allow for the high-flying chipmaker to spotlight its latest products and announce what's ahead. Shares of Nvidia have skyrocketed nearly 80% so far this year, but the company has had a volatile week as some traders took in profits ahead of the conference. As investors look for AI plays beyond Nvidia, CNBC Pro used FactSet data to screen for stocks in the technology and semiconductor space that should see significant earnings growth in the future. Here's the criteria we used for the selection below: S & P 1500 tech sector Market capitalization of $1 billion or more Expected 2024 earnings per share growth of more than 35% Expected 2025 EPS growth of 10% or more Advanced Micro Devices , also a global semiconductor name like Nvidia, remains an AI darling among investors. The stock, which has jumped roughly 30% year to date, added 2.1% on Friday. Analysts anticipate year-over-year earnings per share for 2024 will grow by 39.5% and advance by 48.7% in 2025. Citi recently named AMD among its ""most favored names"" in semiconductors, which it thinks should continue trading at a premium despite worries about high valuations for the stocks. Citi analyst Christopher Danely wrote in a note that ""clients are excited about the AI opportunity for Nvidia and AMD, equipment names on positive capex revisions and various CHIPS act subsidies, and NXP on their resilient auto exposure."" Seagate Technology , a data storage company, also made the cut. Shares are up 43% over the past year, but have added less than 1% in 2024. Analysts forecast EPS growth of 262% for 2024 compared to the previous year. Evercore ISI initiated coverage of Seagate on Feb. 27 with an outperform rating and $110 price target, saying the stock is well positioned to benefit from the cyclical recovery with hyperscalers and that the company could see margin expansion as Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording, or HAMR, technology scales up. Fabless chipmaker SiTime also came up on the screen. It's been a rocky 2024 for the stock, which is off 31% year to date. However, analysts have high expectations for EPS growth, forecasting a year-over-year jump of 224.4% in 2024. Last month, SiTime reported a beat on fourth-quarter revenue and earnings expectations, per FactSet. Management said on the company's earnings call that sequential growth is expected throughout 2024, with the second half of the year being stronger than the first. SiTime's data center business drove significant growth in its communications and enterprise segment, the company added. Other stocks that can expect to see huge earnings growth moving forward include Super Micro Computer , audio and imaging technologies developer Dolby Laboratories and Ultra Clean Holdings .",3/16/2024,-2,0.207800835,0.66144526,0.003308224,0.101881936,0.021933923,0.003629896

This comes amid a choppy few days for the market. The three major indices all broke their five-week winning streaks last Friday and are on pace to finish this week lower as well. Information technology has suffered keenly, and the sector is down 2% this week. With this in mind, analysts Oppenheimer refreshed its list of top picks in the market. New additions to the list include NXP Semiconductors , CyberArk Software , AppLovin and Expedia . Take a look at some of the other names on the list below, and where Oppenheimer analysts see them going forward. The Netherlands-based chipmaker NXP Semiconductors is a new addition to Oppenheimer's list. NXP has rallied nearly 12% in February after reporting a quarterly earnings and revenue beat earlier in the month. However, the stock only has a modest 2.5% gain in 2024. ""We believe NXP is among the best-positioned names in our coverage universe to capitalize on rising semiconductor content in automobiles, and one of the few pure plays leveraged to the growing secure ID, secure transactions, and mobile payment markets,"" Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer wrote. Another new tech name in the list is CyberArk Software. The IT company is a ""leader in the privileged account management sector, and the company estimates it's addressing a market of $44 billion (lifetime value),"" according to analyst Ittai Kidron. Shares are up 11.4% in 2024 and have surged nearly 67% over the past year. Analysts estimate the company could gain an additional 21.7% from current levels, according to LSEG data. CYBR YTD mountain CyberArk Software shares Athleisure company Lululemon is another one of Oppenheimer's favorite picks. Although the stock is down more than 13% year to date, shares are still up more than 41% during a 12-month period. The pullback stems from slowing growth amid intensifying competition within the sports apparel market. Earlier in February, the company announced it would debut its first men's footwear line as part of a larger strategy to double its men's business and grow revenue. ""A meaningful shift to a more digital distribution focus and market strategy is working together with improved product innovation to drive outsized sales and margin expansion at the chain,"" analyst Brian Nagel wrote. ""We remain confident that a solid, if not further fundamental strengthening, will support the stock's premium valuation,"" Nagel added.

445,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/27/energy-stocks-may-rally-after-oil-prices-topped-a-key-level-this-week.html,OXY,Occidental Petroleum,These energy stocks may rally after U.S. crude oil prices rose above a key level this week,"Occidental Petroleum and Diamondback Energy may be poised to rally after U.S. crude oil prices broke above a key resistance level on Friday, according to the chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. U.S. crude oil settled at $78.01 a barrel on Friday to close out its best week since Sept. 1 thanks to robust U.S. growth — as evidenced by a faster-than-expected fourth quarter GDP print — and China promising more spending to boost its economy. West Texas Intermediate futures breaking above the 200-day moving average of $77.64 should confirm that crude oil prices have made a meaningful change to the upside, Miller Tabak's Matt Maley told CNBC. ""That paves the way for higher prices,"" said Bob Yawger, managing director and energy futures strategist at Mizuho Americas. Yawger said WTI not only topping the 200-day moving average but settling above that level is ""definitely much more bullish"" for crude futures prices. Key test next week The energy sector has been lagging oil prices over the past four to six weeks and confirmation now that crude is shifting to the upside should help the stocks ""play catch up,"" Maley said. A key test will be whether WTI next week stays above the 200-day moving average that had been acting as price chart resistance, the strategist said. Conversely, however, Maley noted that it is also critical to monitor the 200-week moving average of $71.58 a barrel for U.S. crude as a support level for prices. ""If crude oil rolls back over, breaks below that level — that's going to tell you that I'm wrong. It's not working,"" the Miller Tabak strategist said. Occidental and Diamondback, in particular, may be poised to bounce because they are highly leveraged to the price of oil, Maley said. Occidental is down 2.2% this year while Diamondback is up less than 1%. The United States Oil ETF , a decent proxy for crude, is almost 10% higher in 2024. Occidental could return to its 2022 highs of between $75 and $80, Maley said. That would imply upside of as much as 37% from Occidental's close Friday of $58.40. Buffett favorite Maley also noted that Occidental is a favorite of Warren Buffett. Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in the Houston-based company to 34% by the end of 2023 from about 21% at the end of 2022. ""He's not a big guy who's keen on leverage,"" Maley said of Buffett. ""And that tells me that if he's buying a stock that's highly leveraged to the price of oil, he believes oil prices are going higher."" Diamondback could hit $170, Maley said, implying 9% appreciation from Friday's close of $156.24. Some 58% of Wall Street analysts have a hold on Occidental while 38% rate the stock the equivalent of buy, with a consensus price target of $67, according to FactSet. Wall Street is more bullish on Diamondback, with 82% of analysts giving the stock the equivalent of a buy and an average price target of $178. No displacement Although Yawger thinks energy stocks will rise on the back of higher crude prices as traders look for beaten down stocks, the sector won't lead the rest of the market: ""They're not going to displace tech for the front of the pack,"" he said. That said, Yawger believes the outlook for crude prices is favorable, owing to the combination of falling U.S. stockpiles and production, economic expansion in the U.S., fiscal stimulus in China, and equity markets recently posting all time highs — if the market's a leading indicator. Not to mention mounting geopolitical risk from conflict in the Middle East and the continued Russia-Ukraine war. Just on Friday, Houthi militants claimed responsibility for a missile attack on an oil tanker, while a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian fuel terminal on the Baltic Sea helped push oil prices higher earlier in the week. ""The one wild card out there is the Ukrainian attacks on Russian infrastructure, oil infrastructure too,"" Yawger said. ""They stepped that up — that could put a bid in the market also.""",1/27/2024,0,0.664882421,0.261422247,0.00382991,0.049088176,0.018238325,0.002538911

If you really want to be like Buffett, you can scroll down on that page to get a full portrait of Berkshire's portfolio of public investments. The list is full of stocks, with the notable exception of two exchange-traded funds: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (symbol: SPY) and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO).

These low-cost funds track the performance of the broad U.S. stock market via the S&P 500, and although they make up a miniscule portion of Buffett's portfolio, he's said over and over that similar investments should make up the majority of yours.

""In my view, for most people, the best thing to do is own the S&P 500 index fund,"" Buffett said at Berkshire's 2020 annual meeting.

Buffett's thinking here is straightforward. Most non-professional investors (and even many professional stock-pickers) have very little chance of outperforming the market. But index fund investors get exposure to the entire U.S. market and can benefit from its historical upward trajectory — and for cheap.

Samsung Electronics on Wednesday posted a 34.57% drop in operating profit in the fourth quarter from a year ago, in line with its guidance issued earlier this month.

Here are Samsung's fourth-quarter results versus estimates:

Revenue: 67.78 trillion Korean won (about $51 billion), vs. 69.27 trillion Korean won expected by LSEG analysts

67.78 trillion Korean won (about $51 billion), vs. 69.27 trillion Korean won expected by LSEG analysts Operating profit: 2.82 trillion Korean won, vs. 3.43 trillion Korean won expected by LSEG analysts

Samsung's revenue for the quarter ending December fell 3.8% from a year ago, while operating profit dropped 34.57% in the same period.

For the full year of 2023, its semiconductor business fell into a record loss of 14.88 trillion Korean won, from a 23.82 trillion Korean won profit a year earlier on the back of weak global demand, according to LSEG data.

Samsung is the world's largest maker for dynamic random-access memory chips which are found in consumer devices such as smartphones and computers.

In its earnings guidance earlier this month, Samsung said it expected operating profit for the October-December quarter to be 2.8 trillion South Korean won ($2.13 billion), down 35% from the same period a year ago when the firm reported an operating profit of 4.31 trillion won.

Samsung said its fourth-quarter revenue and operating profit improved from the third quarter due to a recovery in memory chip prices and ""continued strength"" in sales of premium display products.

Steven van Weyenberg, the Netherlands' finance minister, told CNBC's Karen Tso on Thursday that he isn't worried by ASML's statements threatening to leave the country. The company has since walked back the comments.

In a January call with investors, ASML CEO Peter Wennink said: ""The consequences of limiting labor migration are large, we need those people to innovate. If we can't get those people here, we will go somewhere where we can grow.""

His comments followed controversial plans by the Dutch to scale back tax breaks for highly skilled migrants and limit the number of foreigners who can attend Dutch universities.

ASML is core to the world's semiconductor supply chain. The company makes extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) machines, which are critical to the semiconductor industry for manufacturing integrated circuits.

EUV machines generate an incredibly short wavelength of light in large quantities to print small, complex designs on microchips. The EUV light is created with tiny explosions of molten tin happening at extreme speeds and then bounced off mirrors that ASML says are the flattest surfaces in the world.

""I think many people, many countries would love to welcome ASML, but I think they're strongly embedded in the Netherlands,"" Van Weyenberg told CNBC Thursday.

The minster said he had been involved in discussions between the cabinet and ASML last month concerning the firm's plans to grow in the Netherlands and whether there were enough roads, houses and skilled people from abroad to foster that growth.

Here is what's behind each move,"Every weekday the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer holds a ""Morning Meeting"" livestream at 10:20 a.m. ET. Here's a recap of Friday's key moments. 1. U.S. stocks jumped Friday, putting the S & P 500 on its way to top its Jan. 3, 2022 record close of 4,796.56. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the Dow were also higher Friday after a rough ride earlier in the week. The Dow was trading just below its Jan. 2 record close of $37,715.04. The Nasdaq still has about 6% to go to reach its Nov. 18, 2021 record close of 16,057.44. The Nasdaq 100 , which weighs even more heavily on Big Tech, gained ground Friday, one day after closing at a record high of 16,982.29. The stock market has been recovering from its early 2024 tumble . 2. Meta Platforms stock traded above 52-week highs after CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would spend billions on Nvidia's heavy-duty semiconductors for artificial intelligence. This is great for Meta in its efforts to further its AI ambitions and great for Nvidia as tech companies clamor for its powerful chips. Another Club name, Eaton , could also benefit in the long term. Running Nvidia's chips on a mass scale requires a lot of electricity, which is Eaton's specialty. Nvidia shares hit another all-time high Friday. 3. Broadcom stock hit another all-time high Friday on a bullish analyst upgrade. Goldman Sachs reinstated coverage of the chip designer with a buy rating, citing double-digit percentage revenue growth potential on its acquisition of VMware . We found this call to be especially bullish, as Goldman analysts expect sizeable margin expansion from VMware-related synergies. 4. Evercore added Apple its tactical outperform list. The analysts said that buy-side expectations for the iPhone maker are below consensus, meaning in-line quarterly results could be solid enough to drive Apple shares higher. Additionally, preorders for Apple's mixed reality headset, the Vision Pro, began Friday ahead of its earnings release next month. Shares of Apple were higher Friday but still down about 1% in 2024 on a raft of recent negative commentary. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long META, NVDA, ETN, AVGO, AAPL.

Apple — Shares of the iPad maker jumped 3.26%, leading the rebound in the Nasdaq Composite. The rally came after Bank of America upgraded Apple to buy from neutral. The bank cited a stronger multiyear iPhone upgrade cycle as well as higher growth in services as Apple better monetizes its installed base of customers. Humana — Shares tumbled 7.99% after the health insurance company said in a filing it experienced higher-than-expected medical costs in the fourth quarter, which could also weigh on its 2024 forecast. Humana also said it believes the emerging trends are affecting the industry more broadly. Shares of UnitedHealth fell nearly 3%, while CVS Health lost about 5%. MDC Holdings — The homebuilder soared 18.37% after Japanese homebuilder Sekisui House reached a $4.95 billion deal to buy MDC. Sekisui House will pay $63 per share in cash, nearly 19% above MDC's closing price Wednesday. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing — U.S.-listed shares of the semiconductor company popped 9.79% on the back of a fourth-quarter profit and revenue beat . Taiwan Semiconductor also said it expects 2024 to be a ""healthy growth year."" Shares of some of the company's major customers rose, too, with Nvidia , Apple, Qualcomm and Advanced Micro Devices up at least 2% each. Hertz — The stock jumped 7.54% after being upgraded to overweight by Morgan Stanley. The investment bank said the rental car company's decision to sell about 20,000 electric vehicles from its fleet should help boost the stock. Spirit Airlines — Shares tanked another 7.17% as fallout from the budget airline's blocked proposed merger with JetBlue continued to weigh on the stock. Spirit, which plunged 60% the first three trading days of the week, was also downgraded by Citi on Thursday to sell from neutral. Fastenal — Shares gained 7.18% after the distribution giant exceeded Wall Street expectations for the fourth quarter. Fastenal earned 46 cents per share on revenue of $1.76 billion, while analysts polled by StreetAccount forecast 45 cents per share on $1.75 billion in revenue. Fastenal said it got a boost to unit sales from growth at on-site locations as well as currency tailwinds. First Horizon — The regional bank added 5.06% after First Horizon beat earnings expectations in its fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share were 32 cents, versus the 27 cents expected from analysts polled by StreetAccount. Net interest income and net interest margins also came in higher than expected. Discover Financial Services — Shares slipped 10.8% after the financial services company reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.54 postmarket Wednesday, missing estimates of $2.50, per LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. Birkenstock — The German shoe company shed 7.72% after warning that its full-year earnings will come under pressure as it pursues a global expansion. It was Birkenstock's first earnings report as a public company. KeyCorp — The Cleveland-based bank dropped 4.62% after reporting fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 3 cents, down from 38 cents a year prior. Net interest income also fell year over year, to $928 million from $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. Microchip Technology — The tech manufacturer added 3.38% after being upgraded to outperform from peer perform by Wolfe Research. The firm said a lot has been done to de-risk the stock heading into its fiscal third-quarter earnings report. Plug Power — Shares of the beaten-down fuel cell company dropped 11.52% after Morgan Stanley maintained its underweight rating and $3 price target. Plug will need to use a substantial amount of its $1 billion at-the-market equity program it announced after market close on Thursday, Morgan Stanley said. Grab Holdings — Shares rose 2.74% after JPMorgan upgraded the Singapore-based ride-hailing and food delivery app to overweight. As catalysts for the upgrade, the bank highlighted an attractive valuation and improving delivery margins. Kinder Morgan — Kinder Morgan shares slid 1.42% after the natural gas pipeline operator reported fourth-quarter revenue of $4.04 billion, missing the LSEG consensus estimate of $4.41 billion. — CNBC's Lisa Han, Samantha Subin, Alex Harring, Yun Li, Pia Singh and Sarah Min contributed reporting.",1/18/2024,0,0.119352035,0.522895753,0.004630365,0.194981828,0.151125208,0.007014783

Shares of ASML on Wednesday fell as the company missed sales forecasts, but stuck to its full-year outlook. ASML's stock was down around 4.5% in early European trade after the results. Here's how ASML did versus LSEG consensus estimates: Net sales: 5.29 billion euros ($5.62 billion) versus 5.39 billion euros expected.

5.29 billion euros ($5.62 billion) versus 5.39 billion euros expected. Net profit: 1.22 billion euros versus 1.07 billion euros expected. Net sales fell 21.6% year-on-year while net income dropped 37.4%. ASML's net sales fell in the middle point of the company's guidance. Net bookings for ASML's machinery, a closely watched booking, totaled 3.6 billion euros in the first quarter, down 4% year-on-year but plunging nearly two thirds versus the December quarter.

ASML is one of the most important semiconductor firms in the world, producing tools known as extreme ultraviolet lithography machines, which are required to manufacture the most advanced chips globally. Last year, weak demand for consumer electronics such as smartphones and laptops hit chipmakers that produce semiconductors for those devices. That has in turn led to slightly weaker call for ASML's gear. However, various semiconductor firms across the board, such as memory chipmaker Samsung, are seeing a rebound in demand. ""ASML's latest financial results were not the numbers many investors had been hoping for or expecting. After an excellent Q4 orders, Q1 orders were expected to shrink due to their lumpy nature, but the amount that they fell was worse than expectations and could potentially be an early warning sign for concern,"" Ben Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said in a note on Wednesday. ""There a number of factors at play; the economic environment is still incredibly uncertain and thus customers are not ordering in the same quantities as they have done previously; there is a transition in product in 2025 so some may just be holding off and preserving any spend; it's still early in the year and things may turn around; and finally, China sales are good but difficult to gauge as to what will happen going forward."" ASML has previously said it expects net sales for 2024 to be similar to 2023 and reiterated this projection on Monday. ASML reported net sales of 27.6 billion euros in 2023.

Marriott Bonvoy card welcome offers

The Bonvoy Bevy Card and the Bonvoy Brilliant Card both offer compelling bonus offers, yet their value and benefits vary significantly. The Marriott Bonvoy Bevy™ American Express® Card welcome bonus and perks The Marriott Bonvoy Bevy™ American Express® Card is offering 155,000 Marriott Bonvoy points for new cardholders after you spend $5,000 in eligible purchases within the first six months of account opening. Travel rewards experts generally value Marriott points around 0.8 cents, so you'd earn about $1,240 towards Marriott hotel stays. That's also up from the Bevy card's usual 85,000 bonus points offering. The Bonvoy Bevy card comes with an annual fee of $250 (see rates and fees), along with benefits such as: An annual free night award (at hotels costing up to 50,000 points per night) after spending $15,000 in purchases on the card in a calendar year

What these bonuses can get you

To put this offering into perspective, let's say you're looking to book a stay in Miami. For four nights at the Miami Marriott Biscayne Bay Hotel in early June, you can get a room with a king bed for up to 194,000 points in total (48,000 points for the first three nights and 50,000 points for the fourth night) or roughly $1,552. That means you'd only have to pay about $72 out of pocket if you were to use the Brilliant card's welcome bonus offer, or $312 with the Bevy card. On the other hand, if you're looking for more of an escape somewhere like Hawaii, you can score two nights at the Ritz-Carlton Kapalua in Maui in early June for up to 186,000 points (94,000 points the first night and 92,000 the second night), or $1,488 in total. That means you'd only pay out of pocket $8 with the Brilliant card's welcome bonus, or $248 with the Bevy card.

Marriott Bonvoy credit cards welcome bonus eligibility

Like other cards issued by American Express, the Bevy and Brilliant cards come with certain restrictions around who can earn a welcome bonus. For example, Amex won't let you open more than two of its cards within 90 days — and if you can't open a card, you certainly can't qualify for its welcome bonus. Amex also only allows you to earn a welcome bonus once per card per lifetime, so if you've had that specific card before, you won't be able to earn the welcome bonus again. In addition to the restrictions set by Amex, each card has its own rules for qualifying for its welcome bonus. Marriott Brilliant card bonus restrictions To qualify for this card's welcome bonus offer, you must not: Already have or have had the Bonvoy Brilliant card

They include: Palo Alto , Docebo, R1 RCM, Tenable and Flywire. Flywire The global payment tech network has one of the ""most compelling"" risk/rewards around, the firm says. Analyst James Faucette upgraded the stock earlier this week to overweight from equal weight saying that revenue growth concerns are overdone.

Two gunmen took seven hostages at a factory owned by U.S. company Procter & Gamble in northwest Turkey on Thursday, according to media reports, apparently in protest of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.

Turkish media published an image of one of the purported suspects inside the factory, a man wearing what appeared to be a rudimentary explosives belt and holding a handgun.

Private news agency DHA said the suspects entered the main building of the facility in Gebze in the province of Kocaeli, at around 3 p.m. local time (1200 GMT) and took seven members of the staff hostage.

It claimed the suspects' actions were to highlight the loss of life in the Palestinian enclave. Some 27,000 have been killed in Israel's military operation since Oct. 7, according to the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry.

Ismet Zihni said his wife Suheyla was among the hostages. Speaking from near the factory, he told DHA that he had called her. ""She answered 'We've been taken hostage, we're fine' and she hung up,"" he said.

Harry's has tapped investment banks including Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan , Barclays and Wells Fargo to prepare for the stock market debut in New York, the sources said.

Harry's, whose investors include Bain Capital and Macquarie Capital, is nearing $1 billion in annual revenue and is profitable, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential.

Spokespeople for Harry's and the banks declined to comment.

Headquartered in New York, Harry's was launched in 2013 by co-founders Andy Katz-Mayfield and Jeff Raider. The company started out as a direct-to-consumer men's grooming brand but has since expanded into brick-and-mortar retailers and into hair care, body care and other products.

Besides the original Harry's brand, it owns deodorant brands Lumē and Mando, women's shaving brand Flamingo and cat care brand Cat Person. The company has its own factory in Germany and an in-house brand incubator called Harry's Labs.

In 2020, U.S. antitrust regulators thwarted an attempt by Edgewell Personal Care to acquire Harry's for $1.37 billion. The Federal Trade Commission objected to the deal, arguing it would remove badly needed competition in the shaving industry, which was dominated by Edgewell's Schick brands and Procter & Gamble's Gillette brands.

With its high prices and reliance on travel retail, Japan-based SK-II has struggled as China's economic recovery lags. But P&G executives also pointed to another factor that contributed to the brand's cratering sales during the fiscal second quarter: anti-Japanese sentiment.

In August, Japan started releasing a huge amount of treated radioactive water from its Fukushima nuclear power plant, which was hit by an earthquake and tsunami more than a decade ago. The wastewater was dumped into the Pacific Ocean, leading to strong backlash from Japan's neighbors — including China.

While Japan and the United Nations' nuclear watchdog said the move was safe, China retaliated by banning all seafood imported from Japan. Chinese consumers followed with boycotts of Japanese brands, including P&G's SK-II, fearing that their products would be tainted by radiation. P&G was among the companies that issued statements saying its products were safely produced as they tried to assuage consumer fears.

While the brand took a hit in the previous quarter, P&G executives said SK-II is already seeing sales turn around.

""Our consumer research indicates SK-II brand sentiment is improving, and we expect to see sequential improvement in the back half,"" CFO Andre Schulten said on the company's earnings conference call.

CEO Jon Moeller also reminded investors that previous tensions between Japan and China have hurt SK-II's sales, but the brand always bounced back.

P&G's overall beauty business reported flat volume for the quarter.

Shares of P&G closed up 4% on Tuesday after the company reported earnings that topped Wall Street's estimates. Its quarterly sales, however, fell short of expectations.

Next week will spotlight the bulk of the Magnificent Seven names, which had a strong start to the year, but have been in a slump as of late. Tesla reports Tuesday, Meta Platforms is out Wednesday. Thursday serves a double whammy with Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft . But those results are coming at a time when investors are on edge, uncertain where markets are heading after a pushback in rate cut expectations, a recent rise in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, as well as a spike in Treasury yields. On Friday, the S & P 500 was more than 5% off its 52-week high; it also dipped below 5,000, a level the broader index had only reached for the first time ever in February. Wall Street is hoping next week's megacap tech results will give investors insight into where the artificial intelligence trade is going from here, as a bounce in tech could lift the indexes. They're also hoping a slew consumer commentary will give investors insight into the state of the economy. ""Every week of earnings is the most pivotal one, but I really think this one is the most pivotal one,"" said Kim Forrest, founder at Bokeh Capital, adding, ""I think everybody is like me looking to next week thinking, 'This will be the time where we can figure out the direction of the market.'"" On Friday, the S & P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite registered losing weeks. Further gains, or buying opportunity? As a whole, the bar is high for the Magnificent Seven, even as there are increasing divergences between the names. Tesla, for example, will be in the spotlight next week. Investors are hoping for some positive news out of electric vehicle maker, which is the second-worst performer in the S & P 500 this year as it contends with slowing sales and rising competition from China. This week, Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock to hold from buy following a Reuters report of the possible scrapping of a low-cost car. In response, CEO Elon Musk said Reuters was ""lying."" Shares were down 14% this week. Investors a sense of how artificial intelligence will be monetized, seeking insight into growing Google's cloud business , as well as Microsoft's Copilot chatbot. ""These will give us some of the best indications of AI demand,"" said Emily Leveille, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, adding, ""We expect earnings, I think, to be pretty good for at least for Microsoft and for Meta, just considering sort of recent momentum in earnings growth."" Horizon Investments' Scott Ladner urged caution ahead of the reports given the high expectations swirling around the megacaps. However, he said any pullback in the tech names could give investors an opening to start ""nibbling away"" at additional exposure. While the investment chief anticipates further volatility over the next several weeks, he said he anticipates stocks can again rise over the intermediate term, and gain another 10% from here. ""Especially with the AI trade, those expectations have been ramped up. And so, we would probably be a little bit cautious in terms of getting exposure to those names ahead of earnings releases because that bar is quite high,"" Ladner said. ""But if we do get a sell-off associated with those releases that don't hit up on those raised expectations, it probably is, we think, a better buying opportunity than a selling opportunity at that point,"" Ladner added. He also advised investors to start adding exposure to other interesting assets such as in Europe, or in small caps, which could jump after the central bank cuts rates later this year. Consumer focus Wall Street is also anticipating commentary from consumer-facing companies next week that could give insight into the state of the economy. Investors are hoping that consumer spending, which has thus far held up the economy in the face of higher prices, remains robust. Earnings results from Visa, for example, will be on deck. ""From a sentiment standpoint, consumers don't feel very good, but they haven't acted like that for the better part of years,"" Horizon's Ladner said. ""So, the bigger thing that we've been looking for and look for this quarter, is, are the consumers still acting like they're in good shape? Even if they feel a little bit down in the dumps because they don't like the price that they're paying for things, are they are they still paying those prices? Are they still borrowing? Are they still consuming?"" ""So long as that is continues to be the case, which we expect it to be, we think this consumer-facing company is probably going to have a pretty good rebound in the second half of the year,"" Ladner added. On the economic front, next week will also bring the first-quarter gross domestic product number. Economists polled by FactSet are anticipating the U.S. economy will have expanded by 3.1%, in line with the prior reading. Week ahead calendar All times ET.

We see two paths ahead,"Another Wall Street analyst has thrown their support behind Coterra Energy , adding to Jim Cramer's belief that the oil and gas producer is a stock to watch in the new year. Bank of America on Friday upgraded Coterra to buy from a hold-equivalent rating, becoming the fourth research firm in less than a month to turn positive on the Club holding. Within a few days of each other in December, Citi, UBS and Wells Fargo all recommended clients buy Coterra . More than 60% of analysts covering Coterra now have a buy-equivalent rating on the stock, according to FactSet. ""I think Coterra is either going to get bought [by another company] or have a huge year because there are too many people who are behind for me to think there's just, like, 'Well, let's buy it for no reason,'"" Jim said Friday. ""People just feel like this is the year they can have the breakout."" Coterra on Friday rose nearly 1% to just over $25 per share as the Club considers whether to buy more of the stock. Both oil and natural gas were up on the session. Our most recent Coterra purchase came Dec. 6 — just $25 per share, as investors dumped the stock aggressively during what proved to be a five-day losing streak. Coterra has underperformed the S & P 500 over the past six months, gaining about 1.6% compared with a nearly 6% gain for the broad U.S. stock index. The S & P 500 Energy Sector was up about 4% over the same stretch. CTRA .SPX 6M mountain Coterra versus S & P 500 over the past six months While there's no public indication that Coterra could be imminently acquired, Jim's comments reflect an awareness of the flurry of dealmaking across the energy sector in the wake of ExxonMobil 's $60 billion takeover of Pioneer Natural Resources . Weeks later, Exxon's rival oil major Chevron in October announced a plan to buy Hess for $53 billion. Meanwhile, smaller deals — such as Occidental Petroleum 's $12 billion bid for privately held CrownRock — also have transpired. The latest consolidation move came on Thursday when Apache parent APA said it planned to buy Callon Petroleum for $4.5 billion. Volatile oil and natural gas prices remain an important driver of Coterra's stock. Coterra's revenues are split roughly 50-50 between oil and natural gas. In general, the higher the commodities trade, the more money Coterra will eventually have left over to return to shareholders through stock buybacks — and, to a lesser extent, dividend payouts. Investors in the energy patch, including us at the Club, care deeply about capital returns. @CL.1 @NG.1 6M mountain Oil versus natural gas over the past six months Crude prices have been in the low-to-mid $70s per barrel since early December, a far cry from the more-than-$90 a barrel levels seen in late September. However, mounting tensions in the Middle East — amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and, more recently, shipping attacks in the Red Sea — have emerged as a key factor that could push oil higher. After falling by more than a third between the start of November and mid-December, natural gas prices have started to drift higher. On Friday, U.S. natural gas traded around $2.84 per million British thermal units, up about 20% from its recent low on Dec. 12. A warm winter so far in the Northern Hemisphere has crimped demand for natural gas needed to heat homes and other buildings, weighing on the commodity's price. To be sure, investors in exploration-and-production companies like Coterra pay attention to more than just the day-to-day fluctuations in crude and natural gas prices. Analysts, including those at Bank of America, have touted Coterra's improving well productivity as a reason to like the stock. In its upgrade, Bofa also said Coterra's strong balance sheet is a positive differentiator, making the stock a bit more defensive compared to oil-and-gas-producing peers who carry higher debt loads. Cost savings for Coterra's drilling operations could prove to be another tailwind for its stock this year. The company has estimated about 5% deflation in 2024, which, if it comes to pass, could help keep capital expenditures restrained, leaving more money available to return to shareholders. The eventual refilling of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which the Biden administration drained to combat surging energy prices tied to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and the rise in liquified natural gas exports expected in 2025 represent two additional long-term factors to consider.

The Cedar Innovation Foundation, a 501(c)(4) that was incorporated in Delaware in April, has launched advertisements against at least one powerful lawmaker who's up for reelection, and quietly hired a group of strategists to fight on its behalf, according to records uncovered by CNBC.

It's part of a broader effort by the crypto industry to influence Congress ahead of the 2024 elections and as a variety of crypto-related bills begin to weave their way through Washington.

The crypto market is trying to bounce back after a scandal-filled year that included the criminal fraud conviction of FTX founder and political megadonor Sam Bankman-Fried in November, followed by a plea deal for Binance founder Changpeng Zhao.

Crypto groups spent more than $18 million on lobbying last year, according to an analysis by Reuters. The Cedar Innovation Foundation doesn't publicly disclose its donors or say on its website who runs the organization or where it's located.

Cedar Innovation is being heavily funded by crypto industry players, with Coinbase likely to write a check for the group by the end of the year, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because discussions about financing were private. The group recently hired Mindset Advocacy, a lobbying shop that's worked for Goldman Sachs , Amazon Web Services and Barclays , according to a recent disclosure report and data from the nonpartisan organization OpenSecrets.

Dennis Kelleher, CEO of the nonprofit Better Markets, told CNBC that he predicts the industry is going to spend big this year to try to fend off lawmakers who are critical of crypto.

""What we're going to see in 2024 is a massive ramp up in crypto-funded 'dark' money campaigns against anybody who isn't a crypto shill,"" Kelleher said. ""By the end of the year, when it's all added up, I think the crypto industry is going to put hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in trying to defeat people who want to actually represent the voters, rather than represent crypto.""

Josh Vlasto, a spokesman for the foundation and a veteran Democratic strategist who worked for former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., didn't answer questions regarding the group's backers. In a statement to CNBC, he took aim at Kelleher and Better Markets.

""It's not surprising that a Washington think tank funded by the big banks and hedge fund managers is trying to destroy crypto to retain their monopoly on access to the money of all Americans,"" Vlasto said.

Kelleher fired back saying Cedar Innovation was lying about Better Markets and called his organization an ""independent nonprofit.""

A Coinbase spokesperson declined to comment about potential funding of Cedar Innovation Foundation and referred CNBC to public remarks by executives. In a post last month on X, formerly known as Twitter, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said, ""the crypto industry has a large war chest now to elect pro-crypto candidates in 2024,"" referring to a recent donation the company made to a new super PAC.",1/8/2024,0,0.002827081,0.027765417,0.00189091,0.377949953,0.586060226,0.003506409

WASHINGTON — The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Wednesday unveiled long-awaited changes to how the nation's biggest banks structure overdraft protection plans. The independent watchdog agency said the new rule closes a loophole that for decades has exempted overdraft loans from the consumer protections required by the 1968 Truth in Lending Act. Since 2000, American consumers have paid an estimated $280 billion in bank overdraft fees, according to CFPB data. During that time, the annual revenue big banks derived from overdraft fees soared, helped along by the boom in consumer debit cards tied directly to checking accounts. ""For too long, some banks have charged exorbitant overdraft fees—sometimes $30 or more—that often hit the most vulnerable Americans the hardest, all while banks pad their bottom lines,"" President Joe Biden said in a statement Wednesday on the new rules. ""Banks call it a service—I call it exploitation.""

The new regulations would apply only to banks with more than $10 billion in assets, a total of around 175 institutions nationwide, the CFPB said. Taken together, these banks typically account for the lion's share of the overdraft fees charged in any given year. CFPB officials said they expected the rule to be finalized in the coming year, and go into effect in October 2025. Banking trade groups deeply opposed to any changes in the overdraft rules have already begun to mobilize opposition, which is only expected to grow. Earlier this month, the Consumer Bankers Association launched a website to promote ""the value of overdraft services, and why government mandates are misguided."" The proposal is part of the larger Biden administration effort to crack down on what it calls ""junk fees,"" many of which are charged to consumers with little notice, and do not reflect the real cost of the service. ""This is about the companies that rip off hardworking Americans simply because they can,"" said Biden.

U.S. companies plan to give salary increases of 4%, on average, this year, down from 4.4% in 2023, according to a survey by Willis Towers Watson.

Similarly, a Mercer poll indicates companies' total salary budgets, which include money for all pay increases, such as raises and promotions, will be 3.8% in 2024, on average. That's down from the 4.1% paid out last year.

But Treasury yields kept creeping up throughout the session and the sellers pounced once the market lost its momentum. That's pushed the S & P 500 into the red. The Nasdaq Composite also is lower, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is basically flat. Meta gains : Shares of Meta Platforms rose 2% in the session. The Facebook and Instagram owner on Thursday unveiled the latest version of its large language model, called Llama 3. The social media giant also announced that its free-to-use artificial intelligence assistant, powered by Llama 3, is rolling out across its family of apps. Check it out because it's a pretty cool tool that can be used on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger for in-app search (powered by Club holding Alphabet 's Google), recommendations, and fast image generation. Meta isn't monetizing this new assistant directly, but new AI tools and services like this should enhance the user experience on Meta's social media platforms and increase engagement. Meta is also leveraging AI to improve ad targeting. Jim Cramer's chatter: We added to our position in Estee Lauder this morning after a bullish analyst call from Deutsche Bank. ""Is it time to believe that Estee Lauder CEO Fabrizio Freda is still a good operator? He navigated the downturn in U.S. department stores,"" Jim Cramer said Thursday. ""Can he fix China and duty free? Starting to think so."" Shares of Starbucks are higher for a fourth session in a row and traded around $87 each Thursday. To be sure, it follows a nine-session stretch in which the stock finished in the green just once. ""Is Starbucks bottoming? Or do you need the number cuts first before a bottom?"" Jim said, alluding to the idea on Wall Street that the coffee chain will revise its full-year guidance lower alongside its earnings report April 30. Meanwhile, the correction in semiconductor and other AI-related stocks continued Thursday. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF has fallen more than 5% so far this week and has fallen about 10% since its closing high on March 7. Zooming in, memory chipmaker Micron has had a rough April, closing higher just three times so far this month. The stock was lower again Thursday. ""Micron's decline reminds me that the strength in the stock comes from a lack of supply of manufacturing. It will be a long time before any plants come on line, but it is troubling,"" Jim said. Shares of the homebuilder D.R. Horton were higher Thursday on better-than-expected earnings and a raise to its full-year revenue outlook. ""D.R Horton should have more of a readthrough to Stanley Black & Decker but interest rates are still not behaving,"" Jim said, referring to the Club holding and parent company of DeWalt and other tool brands. Shares of Stanley Black & Decker were flat Thursday, but down more than 4% over the past five sessions. Up next: The week may be winding down, but there are still plenty of big name companies set to report. On Thursday night, we'll hear from Netflix , medical device maker Intuitive Surgical , and the chemical company PPG Industries . Club holding Procter & Gamble reports Friday morning, and we'll look to see if the volumes and margins continued to improve in the company's fiscal 2024 third quarter.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is poised to issue a final rule on Wednesday that would require companies to beef up disclosures around climate risks — a level of transparency that should help investors assess a company's value in a warming world, said experts. At a high level, the rule — initially proposed in March 2022 — would expand investors' insight into the threat that climate change poses to publicly listed companies and how businesses contribute to a warming planet. Climate disclosures would be made in annual filings companies make to the SEC, such as a Form 10-K, and in registration statements filed before an initial public offering. ""I think climate disclosures have largely become table stakes for the investment community,"" said Lindsey Stewart, director of investment stewardship research at Morningstar.

Current climate disclosures are 'uncommon'

Such data points are currently spotty. Publicly listed U.S. companies make climate disclosures on a voluntary basis, and they remain ""uncommon in all but a few sectors,"" according to S&P Global. Corporations will likely be required to disclose short- and long-term physical risks, such as the impacts of hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, extreme heat and sea level rise, Stewart said. They'd also likely report ""transition"" risks from legal or regulatory changes, new technology and business practices that aim to adapt to a hotter world, he said.

Corporations would also be required to report their total greenhouse gas emissions, both created directly by a company and indirectly along its supply chain. The depth of that carbon reporting may be diluted from the SEC's initial proposal in March 2022 due to blowback and to insulate the rule from legal challenges, experts said. Overall, transparency around climate risk may be essential for investors to gauge if a company's stock is worth holding or if its stock price is reasonable, experts said — for example, is it too expensive given high exposure to climate risk, or perhaps fairly priced considering it's well positioned? ""Investors want to be able to accurately price those risks and opportunities as they look medium and longer term at their investments,"" especially retirement investors who may have a timeline decades in the future, said Rachel Curley, director of policy and programs at the U.S. Sustainable Investment Forum.

Challenges are 'likely'

Congressional and legal challenges to the rule ""are likely,"" Jaret Seiberg, financial services and housing policy analyst at TD Cowen, wrote Thursday in a research note. Last year, a group of House and Senate Republicans sent a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler criticizing the proposal, saying it ""exceeds the [agency's] mission, expertise, and authority.""

""Congress created the SEC to carry out the mission of protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation — not to advance progressive climate policies,"" according to its three signatories, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich.

Carbon emissions accounting is contentious

One particularly contentious area involves the depth of greenhouse gas reporting, experts said. The SEC proposal outlined three tiers of emissions disclosures: Scopes 1, 2 and 3. Scope 1 emissions are direct. They're caused by operating the things a company owns or controls: for example, by running machinery to make products, driving vehicles, or heating buildings and powering computers, according to the World Economic Forum. Scope 2 emissions are indirect. They're created by the production of energy that an organization buys, the WEF said. Companies can cut Scope 2 emissions by installing solar panels or using renewable energy rather than using electricity from fossil fuels, for example, it said. Scope 3 emissions are also indirect but broader: They include emissions ""up and down [a company's] value chain,"" according to Deloitte. For example, they may ""be emitted by a company's suppliers of raw material, or when a consumer uses a company's products,"" S&P Global wrote.

Kyrsten Sinema will not run for re-election in Arizona,"U.S. Sen. Kyrtsen Sinema (D-AZ) speaks at a news conference after the Senate passed the Respect for Marriage Act at the Capitol Building on November 29, 2022 in Washington, DC.

Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema announced Tuesday that she will not run for re-election this year, leaving the Senate after one term that saw her paint Arizona blue, leave the Democratic Party and play a key role in numerous legislative negotiations in a tightly divided Senate.

""Because I choose civility, understanding, listening, working together to get stuff done, I will leave the Senate at the end of this year,"" Sinema said in a video posted on her X account.

Sinema's decision paves the way for a tough and expensive fight for her seat — though it will be more straightforward than the messy three-way contest she would have prompted by staying in. The leading Republican, 2022 gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, and the leading Democrat, Rep. Ruben Gallego, are already running hard to replace Sinema.

In her video, Sinema said partisan warfare has carried the day.

""Compromise is a dirty word. We've arrived at that crossroad, and we chose anger and division. I believe in my approach, but it's not what America wants right now,"" Sinema said.

Sinema's decision comes as her prospects of victory appeared dim if she ran. Polling on the race is sparse, but surveys have consistently shown Sinema in third place in a hypothetical three-way contest featuring Gallego and Lake. It was unclear which candidate she would have pulled more support from.

Notably, Sinema believed she was stronger with Arizona Republicans than with her former party. In a prospectus reported by NBC News last September, Sinema told donors her path to victory was to attract 10% to 20% of Democrats, 60% to 70% of independents and 25% to 35% of Republicans.

Gallego praised Sinema on news of her departure.

""As we look ahead, Arizona is at a crossroads. Protecting abortion access, tackling housing affordability, securing our water supply, defending our democracy — all of this and more is on the line,"" he said in a statement. ""I welcome all Arizonans, including Senator Sinema, to join me in that mission.""

Lake also praised Sinema in a statement: ""We may not agree on everything, but I know she shares my love for Arizona. Senator Sinema had the courage to stand tall against the far left in defense of the filibuster — despite the overwhelming pressure from the radicals in her party like Ruben Gallego who called on her to burn it all down.""

Republicans, who are hoping to flip the Senate back into their control this year, are eyeing Arizona as a potential pickup opportunity. Democrats hold a slim majority in the Senate, and the GOP needs a net gain of two seats to win the chamber outright or one seat plus the tie-breaking vice presidency.

Sinema's political arc has been extraordinary, from Green Party organizer to the GOP's erstwhile favorite Democrat in the U.S. Senate. In 2004 she became a Democrat and was elected to the Arizona Legislature. At a 2011 progressive gathering, she labeled Arizona the ""meth lab of democracy"" while criticizing legislation that state Republicans were advancing. She ran and won an election in 2012 to the U.S. House, where her voting record showed some centrist bona fides. She used that moderate approach to get elected to the Senate in 2018, ending a losing streak for Democrats statewide.

Sinema was a pivotal vote during Biden's first two years in the 50-50 Senate, using her clout to shape his signature Inflation Reduction Act and single-handedly nix provisions she opposed, like tax rate increases on corporations and the wealthy, and to pare back a provision aimed at lowering prescription drug prices. She was at the center of multiple successful bipartisan negotiations, including on infrastructure and gun safety.

Sinema left her party to become an independent in 2022, while still helping Democrats maintain control of the Senate. That came after an irreparable rift between Sinema and Arizona Democrats, as she stood in the way of some legislation proposed by Biden and voted to block Democratic efforts to undo the Senate filibuster to advance voting-rights legislation.

Previous key allies, like EMILY's List, said they would no longer support Sinema, and there was talk of Gallego challenging her in a Democratic primary. She announced in December 2022 that she would leave the Democratic Party and become an independent, but Sinema did not tip her hand about whether she'd run for re-election.

Sinema's influence has waned since Republicans took control of the House and Democrats gained one seat in the Senate in 2023. The Arizona senator negotiated a border security deal with Democrats and Republicans earlier this year, but it was blocked by Republicans.

""What I've demonstrated in my five years in the United States Senate, is that I have a proven track record of bringing disparate interests and groups together, finding common ground and moving forward with bipartisan solutions,"" Sinema told NBC News in December in the midst of the border bill negotiations.

And as she often did, she shrugged off a question then about her re-election plans, casting it as a sideshow compared to her legislative work: ""I'm 100% focused on delivering a real result,"" Sinema continued.

Arizona's tilt to becoming a purple state was confirmed in 2020, when Biden narrowly carried the state against then-President Donald Trump. In 2022, Arizona's other senator, Democrat Mark Kelly, won his re-election race by 5 percentage points, but in another statewide race, now-Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, beat Lake by less than 1 point.

Other key 2024 battleground races include Democratic Sens. Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, both running for re-election, while in West Virginia, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin is not running for another term.",3/5/2024,0,0.02755646,0.460377485,0.008792413,0.432701558,0.067579895,0.002992084

But some market watchers think things could be about to turn around. ""I think it would be an opportune time to invest in real estate especially given that we are forecasting interest rates to decline over the next 12 months,"" according to Kevin Brown, senior equities analyst at financial services firm Morningstar. He suggests that investors look to have 10% of their portfolio exposed to ""real estate in some form, as a good rule of thumb."" ""That exposure can come from REITs [real estate investment trusts] or direct ownership, or other real estate investments if you are a large investor. But REITs present a great and easy opportunity to the asset class which is otherwise difficult to invest in. With rate cuts anticipated, I expect REITs to outperform the broader U.S. market this year,"" Brown told CNBC Pro on Feb. 14. Rick Romano, Head of Global Real Estate Securities at PGIM Real Estate, agrees, saying that REITs offer investors ""a unique and fantastic"" opportunity to invest across geographies and segments right now. Commercial property pick One segment Brown likes is commercial properties occupied by tenants such as drugstores, retailers, food outlets and gas stations. The diversity — and the fact that tenants are selling necessities — mean they are not overly sensitive to economic conditions and can post gains even if a recession hits, Brown said, naming Realty Income as a REIT to consider. Realty Incomes says its portfolio includes over 13,000 commercial properties with a 98.8% occupancy rate. ""Realty Income has a triple net lease structure, which means their tenants are responsible for everything, [namely] all expenses that can be generated by the property. They are also a conservative tenant with low rents relative to the revenues generated by tenants so there's a very low risk of it not receiving rent,"" Brown said. He also flagged that the company is part of the S & P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index and has raised its dividend payout for 25 consecutive years. The REIT has a 5-year average dividend yield of 4.5% and is trading at around a 10% discount to net asset value — a key measure of a REIT's value — according to FactSet data. Boom in data centers Aside from commercial spaces, PGIM's Romano sees opportunities in data centers. He expects a shortage of supply in 2023-2024, ""in conjunction with this very severe demand spike due to AI right now."" ""It's an area that we see some of the best growth rates within the real estate space,"" he added. Among the REITs with an exposure to data centers that Romano's PGIM Global Real Estate Fund is invested in are Prologis (8.1% of the fund as of Dec. 2023) and Equinix (5.3% of the fund). Prologis — which owns almost 800 properties globally, including a number of data centers — is trading at a premium of around 4% to net asset value. Equinix, with 250 data centers, is trading at a premium of around 17% according to FactSet data. Senior housing buys? Morningstar's Brown highlighted the senior housing market as a segment to watch, particularly in the U.S. as the baby boomer generation ages. ""We're going to have very high demand growth,"" he said, highlighting that the Covid pandemic reduced building activity and, as such, supply is not keeping up with occupancy levels. REITs he likes include Ventas — which has over 1,400 properties including senior housing facilities and outpatient medical buildings across the U.S., U.K and Canada — as well as Welltower , which has exposure to senior housing, outpatient care facilities and care spaces. ""Ventas, in particular, is trading at a very big discount,"" Brown noted. ""Both names are buys into the bigger senior housing theme.""

""I suspect that the Fed will be the first to really put a cut in,"" DeAnne Julius, a founding member of the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, told CNBC on Tuesday.

Investors are closely monitoring central bank moves on the back of a considerable reduction in inflation across major economies. The expectation of reduced rates has boosted equity markets since late 2023.

So far, Switzerland was the first major economy to cut interest rates back in late March.

Market players are currently pricing in a 92.8% chance that the ECB will cut rates in June from the historically high level of 4%, according to LSEG data. The same database shows only a 53.5% chance of a cut by the Federal Reserve at their June meeting.

Julius explained her forecast was based on the Fed's dual mandate, which looks at both inflation and employment in the U.S. economy. The latest job figures pointed to a buoyant U.S. labor market, and inflation has also dropped though it is still above the Fed's 2% target.

""I think things move a little faster in the U.S., quite frankly. The labour market adjusts more quickly,"" she said.

Strong economic data out of the United States has led market players to reduce their expectations for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in 2024. Whereas at the start of the year, they were expecting about six rate cuts to take place in 2024, they are now only forecasting about three such reductions.

""The labor market adjusts more quickly. I don't think the Fed will move very much, but I suspect that there could well be a little move there, somewhere, towards the second half of the year,"" Julius added. ""And that would create a little space and maybe a little pressure even on the Bank of England ... whose economy is, of course, tied to the U.S. economy, and the European economy.""

Her comments come just ahead of a European Central Bank meeting due on Thursday. Though the central bank is unlikely to change rates at this gathering, markets are looking for some clues on whether the institution led by Christine Lagarde will be in a position to cut borrowing costs in June.

""The ECB, [it] takes them a while to reach consensus. Because the situation is, inflation is far too high in some of the countries still, and below their 2% target in others. So, you know, theirs is not really an economic analysis, it's partly a political and an internal weighting of the different economies and the different politics in the different economies,"" Julius said.

""So Christine Lagarde has a real job on her hands. And I think she does a good job. But that does mean that she's got to carefully move towards something that might be a consensus, and I don't think they're near a consensus yet for a rate cut.""

So far, Lagarde has stressed that policymakers will consider lowering interest rates at the June meeting, but she has signaled an uncertain path beyond that point. Notably, the June gathering will be the first one for which data from spring wage negotiations will be available.",4/11/2024,2,0.014634309,0.219886556,0.002712697,0.283939838,0.475779712,0.00304693

Analyst Andrew Marok downgraded the dating app to market perform from outperform. He also removed his price target after previously expecting shares to reach $15 from their Wednesday close of $11.22. Marok said dating apps may need a refresh to appeal to Gen Z, which favors slower-paced connections and spends more time being single. While he said the brand has ""good bones,"" the outlook is cloudy until a new action plan and its reception among users comes to light. ""While we believe that its brand is among the best-positioned in the space in terms of relevance with young people, we do see near-term headwinds stemming from changing user habits, which require significant rethinks among apps built in the Millennial era,"" Marok said.

The firm downgraded the bank stock to neutral from buy, but raised its price target slightly to $40 per share from $39. UBS' forecast implies nearly 7% upside ahead from Wednesday's $37.44 close. Analyst Erika Najarian defines the ""rate trap"" as a double edged sword of central bank interest rate cuts or a higher-for-longer scenario. If the Federal Reserve indeed does pivot to cuts, then ""asset sensitive BAC will be subject to downward revisions to EPS [earnings per share]"" and will hurt its market multiple. If interest rates remain elevated for longer, Najarian says, then investors may become concerned with BofA's held to maturity portfolio which could also hurt the stock's market multiple. ""After adjusting estimates upward to reflect 3 cuts in '24 and 4 cuts in '25 (vs. 6 and 2 prior) and raising our PT by $1 to $40, we find upside limited at BAC over the next 12 months,"" Najarian said. ""To be clear, there's a lot of positive momentum at the company, from strong deposit growth, a reawakened investment banking & markets business, and the prospect for accelerating buybacks, especially in 2H24,"" the analyst added.

We're no longer recording the audio, so we can get this new written feature to members as quickly as possible. Here is Friday's edition. We came across a couple of interesting notes from Bank of America research Friday afternoon as we watch to see whether the S & P 500 can closed above 5,000 for the first time ever. Inventory issues: One looked at the debacle at the Children's Place , which lost about half its market cap Friday after saying that it's working with advisors and lenders to improve liquidity and strengthen its balance sheet. The announcement comes after a big miss on margins due to higher levels of promotional activity. In order to end the year clean, the company will likely need to liquidate inventory, and Bank of America thinks off-price retailers like Burlington and Ross Stores as well as Club name TJX Companies (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods) will be natural winners from the woes facing The Children's Place. ""We see this as a good opportunity for BURL, ROST and TJX to build share in kid's and baby, particularly with a lower income consumer interested in branded goods,"" Bank of America said. TJX shares hit a new all-time high Friday and were knocking on the door of $100, which is our Club price target. We have our buy-equivalent 1 rating on TJX stock. Chip design: The other note was about the media report that said Club name Nvidia may look to enter the custom artificial intelligence chip market. Bank of America thinks this could be a ""long-term competitive risk"" for the current leaders Club name Broadcom and Bullpen name Marvell but doesn't think there's any near-term risk for them because these conversations can take years and they have the networking expertise. Sector spotlight : Consumer staples were the second worst performing group and most of the damage was concentrated in the food stocks. ""I'm very worried about any packaged goods company because of the Pepsi number. People are snacking less because they are leaving home to go back to the office."" Jim Cramer said Friday. PepsiCo was down 3% in afternoon trading. One of the few bright spots in staples this session was Estee Lauder . The stock was on pace to break a three-day losing streak that started after Monday's 12% surge in reaction to more cost cuts and CEO Fabrizio Freda declaring the company was at a positive inflection point . ""I thought the bad number from L'Oreal would have brought EL down, but I'm beginning to be a believer,"" Jim said. Next week: There are no companies in the portfolio reporting earnings next week. But there are still 61 companies in the S & P 500 and two stocks in the Dow reporting – still plenty to sink our teeth into. Some notable names are Cisco Systems , CocaCola , Airbnb , DraftKings , Applied Materials , Molson Coors , and MGM Resorts . On data the side, we'll get two key inflation reports: the consumer price index (CPI) on Tuesday and the producer price index (PPI) on Friday. Sandwiched in between Thursday is retail sales. Among the earnings on tap, Dow stock Cisco is one to watch after Reuters reported the networking equipment company plans to lay off thousands of jobs next week as part of a restructuring plan. Most stocks have rallied on layoff news, but then again if you bought Snap on its layoffs announcement you would've gotten crushed by bad earnings. ""I'm not sure if Cisco layoffs is a good omen because the stock didn't bounce when it announced had have a deal with Nvidia, the kingmaker in AI"" Cramer said.

Carnival announced on Tuesday that it would reroute cruise itineraries for a dozen ships scheduled to transit the Red Sea as tensions rise in the Middle East.

""Given recent developments and in close consultation with global security experts and government authorities, the company has made the decision to reroute itineraries for 12 ships across seven brands, which were scheduled to transit the Red Sea through May 2024,"" the cruise line said in a press release.

Repeated attacks on vessels by Iranian-backed Houthi Rebels have forced major shipping and oil companies to divert their routes, adding days to shipping times and driving up costs.

The U.S. has responded by striking the Houthis in Yemen, but U.S. President Joe Biden admitted earlier this month the retaliation was not stopping the group. A weekend attack by Iranian-backed militants killed three U.S. service members in Jordan and also heightened tensions in the region.

Carnival expects the rerouting to affect its adjusted earnings per share by 7 cents to 8 cents in 2024. The company forecast adjusted full-year earnings per share of 93 cents, according to its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings released last month. The cruise liner is expected to release its fiscal 2024 first-quarter earnings in March.

Carnival is the latest company to announce disruptions due to the conflicts in the Red Sea. Earlier this month, Royal Caribbean and Swiss-Italian operator MSC Cruises said they would cancel trips in the region.

A spokesperson for Carnival told CNBC the cruise line or a travel advisor would directly contact customers affected by the changes.

Shares of Carnival traded flat Tuesday. The stock is up more than 50% in the past year. While bookings have rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic, the stock is almost 70% off its pre-pandemic high.

U.S. forces, supported by U.S. European Command destroyers, on Saturday and Sunday destroyed more than 80 one-way attack drones and at least six ballistic missiles aimed at Israel from Iran and Yemen, the U.S. Central Command, or CENTCOM, said on Monday.

This includes a ballistic missile on its launcher vehicle and seven UAVs destroyed on the ground prior to their launch in areas controlled by Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, CENTCOM said in a post on X.

Iran launched an attack late on Saturday on Israeli territory with drones and missiles in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on its embassy compound in Syria on April 1 that killed top Revolutionary Guards commanders.

The attack by more than 300 missiles and drones, mostly launched from inside Iran, caused only modest damage as most were shot down by Israel's Iron Dome defense system and with help from the United States, Britain, France and Jordan.

Republican U.S. lawmakers on Friday criticized the Biden administration after sanctioned Chinese telecoms equipment giant Huawei unveiled a laptop this week powered by an Intel AI chip.

The United States placed Huawei on a trade restriction list in 2019 for violating Iran sanctions, part of a broader effort to hobble Beijing's technological advances. Placement on the list means the company's suppliers have to seek a special, difficult-to-obtain license before shipping to it.

One such license, issued by the Trump administration, has allowed Intel to ship central processors to Huawei for use in laptops since 2020. China hardliners had urged the Biden administration to revoke that license, but many grudgingly accepted that it would expire later this year and not be renewed.

Huawei's unveiling Thursday of its first AI-enabled laptop, the MateBook X Pro powered by Intel's new Core Ultra 9 processor, shocked and angered them, because it suggested to them that the Commerce Department had approved shipments of the new chip to Huawei.

""One of the greatest mysteries in Washington, DC is why the Department of Commerce continues to allow U.S. technology to be shipped to Huawei"" Republican Congressman Michael Gallagher, who chairs the House of Representatives select committee on China, said in a statement to Reuters.

A source familiar with the matter said the chips were shipped under a preexisting license. They are not covered by recent broad-cased restrictions on AI chip shipments to China, the source and another person said.

The Commerce Department and Intel declined to comment. Huawei did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",4/15/2024,-2,0.002221506,0.00067234,0.000266221,0.99560827,0.00101621,0.000215472

The dollar reached its highest since early November against a basket of currencies on Monday, and sent the yen to its lowest level since 1990, after U.S. retail sales increased more than expected in March.

Retail sales rose 0.7% last month and data for February was revised higher to show sales rebounding 0.9% instead 0.6% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales, which are mostly goods and are not adjusted for inflation, rising 0.3% in March.

The greenback has gained as still sticky inflation and still strong growth leads investors to push back expectations on when the Federal Reserve is likely to begin cutting rates. The U.S. central bank also now expected to make fewer cuts than previously.

""U.S. data just keeps coming better and better than expected,"" said Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies in New York.

Traders are now pricing in fewer than two 25 basis points cuts by year-end, after previously expecting three.

New York Fed President John Williams said on Monday that Fed policy was in a good place and remained restrictive, adding that his own view was that interest rate cuts would likely begin this year.

The Japanese yen in particular has suffered from U.S. dollar strength and the large interest rate differential between the two countries. Japanese monetary officials have ramped up warnings that they may intervene to shore up the currency. Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Monday he was watching currency moves closely, repeating that Tokyo is ""fully prepared"" to act.

Bechtel sees any potential intervention as more likely if the yen is underperforming, rather than during episodes of broad-based dollar strength.

""I think we still need a big day of yen really underperforming the market by 1% or more,"" he said, adding that Japanese officials might also step in at a key level such as 155.

The dollar was last up 0.62% against the Japanese currency at 154.22. The dollar index was last up 0.14% at 106.19.

Investors are also focused on escalating tensions in the middle east, which if they worsen are likely to benefit the safe haven U.S. dollar and Swiss franc.

President Joe Biden warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the U.S. would not take part in a counteroffensive against Iran, an option Netanyahu's war cabinet favors after a mass drone and missile attack on Israeli territory, according to officials.

The euro was little changed against the dollar at $1.0643. It recorded its biggest weekly percentage drop since late September 2022 last week as the European Central Bank left the door open to a rate cut in June.

The pound strengthened 0.22% to $1.248.

In 2023, the median annual wage for all U.S. workers was $48,060, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics , which means Americans in around half the states earned less than that benchmark, while workers in the other half earned more .

The Northeast and Western regions tend to have higher-earning populations compared with the South and some states in the Midwest.

Massachusetts tops the rankings with the highest median wage of $60,690 for individual workers, while Mississippi has the lowest median wage in the country at $37,500.

Local wages typically correlate with local cost of living, which means many of the states where workers earn the most are also the states that are most expensive to live in.

Massachusetts, for example, has the second-highest cost of living in the U.S., while Mississippi has the second-lowest living costs, according to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center state-by-state cost of living index, based on Council for Community and Economic Research survey data.

A few states are outliers, though. In Wyoming, workers have the 26th highest median wage, but the 18th lowest cost of living. Florida, similarly, has the 14th lowest median wage, but is only the 29th cheapest state to live in, according to MERIC.

Manuel Rocha in 2003 when he joined the firm of Steel Hector & Davis to help open doors in Latin America. Raul Rubiera | Miami Herald | Getty Images

When Carolyn Lamb saw news of Cuban spy Victor Manuel Rocha's arrest on the news last December, she recognized him immediately. It was the same man who had sat in her Omaha living room 17 years ago, trying to make a deal. On Friday, Rocha, 73, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for acting as a foreign agent on behalf of the Cuban government, pleading guilty to two counts of conspiracy. On top of his prison sentence, Rocha faces three years of supervised release, a $500,000 fine, and several other conditions. Rocha's arrest last year stunned the diplomatic community, in part because of his longevity as an agent—more than 40 years, much of it spent working for the US State Department, including a stint as US ambassador to Bolivia and another at the National Security Council. In exchange for a reduced sentence, Rocha's agreement requires him to cooperate with prosecutors and reveal what clandestine activities he performed for Cuba. Carolyn Lamb hopes that process will reveal what Rocha was up to in her living room nearly 20 years.

The claims

Lamb describes how Rocha traveled across the country in 2007, and offered to purchase the paper claims to an 80-acre farm, a 1959 Buick, and thousands of shares in the Cuban Telephone Company that belonged to Lamb's father before they were seized by the Castro regime.

Castro didn't nationalize just American property; he seized all private property. Every home and every business became the property of the government, and none of the owners were paid for them. With few exceptions, that is still true today. In 1970, the US government valued Lamb's claim at $489,208, and set an annual interest rate of 6% from the date of loss to the date of settlement. Under that formula, the Cubans owe $1.9 million on the claim today. That number gets bigger every day that goes by without a settlement. ""They told me my claim was crap,"" Lamb says of Rocha and a business partner with him that day in Omaha. They offered her $114,000 for the claim. Lamb said she was insulted and suspicious of what she saw as such a low-ball offer. There are nearly 6,000 American claims to property and land in Cuba, all of it seized by Fidel Castro's government after his 1959 coup d'etat. The value of the claims totals more than $7 billion, and many are held by major U.S. brands like Pepsi, General Electric, and Twentieth Century Fox.

This wide scale confiscation of Americans' property was one of the chief reasons the United States imposed an embargo on Cuba more than 60 years ago. Before the embargo can be lifted, the claims for those properties must be settled. ""It's still one of the biggest impediments to normalization of relations with Cuba,"" says Jason Poblete, Lamb's attorney. ""Was [Rocha] part of a scheme to help depress the value of these claims, to give an escape clause to the Cuban government?"" Poblete wondered aloud. The lower the value of the claims, the less the Cuban government would have to pay in any future negotiated settlement. Poblete also wondered if Rocha was thwarting the process. ""Did he make it harder to settle the claims issue?"" he said in an interview with CNBC. It would be helpful to the Cubans to have information from Rocha because in a negotiation on the claims ""any intelligence you could get would be useful,"" said John Kavulich, head of the US-Cuba Trade and Economic Council.

But if Rocha's participation in the claims buying business was indeed part of his covert work, that would come as news to his business partner. Timothy Ashby says he was ""astonished"" by Rocha's arrest because ""He was almost too right wing to be believed,"" and Ashby couldn't imagine Rocha working for a communist government. But looking back on it, Ashby says there were signs. ""He had a chip on his shoulder about rich people."" And that's not all. ""Once a week he would have the offices swept for bugs because he said he was concerned about the FBI listening to them,"" Ashby told CNBC in a recent interview. Ashby assumed Rocha's paranoia about eavesdropping was in response to the George W. Bush administration's opposition to the Cuba claims buying business. But according to the Justice Department, by that point Rocha was already in his third decade as a Cuban agent. Ashby says that buying up the claims was his idea, and he brought Rocha in because of his connections in the US government. The company they formed ultimately raised $10.5 million and bought nine claims including large pieces of land and some hotels. But they were forced to shutter the operation, says Ashby, when the Bush administration deemed their activities a violation of the embargo. Timothy Ashby now writes spy novels. Little did he know he'd be a character in a real-life case.

Covert career

Born in Columbia in 1950, Rocha became a naturalized US Citizen in 1978, and a State Department employee in 1981. During his long diplomatic career, he served in US embassies in the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Mexico, Argentina, and finally Bolivia where he was ambassador. In the mid-90s he did a 1-year stint on the National Security Council, where he had special responsibility for Cuba and he subsequently served in the US Interest Section in Havana. Throughout his career, the DOJ says he had unique access to nonpublic US government information. Rocha was caught when an undercover FBI agent, impersonating a Cuban spy, recorded him on camera during 3 separate meetings in Miami in 2022 and 2023. According to the Justice Department's complaint, throughout the meetings Rocha behaved as a Cuban agent, consistently referred to the United States as ""the enemy,"" and used the term ""we"" to describe himself and Cuba. ""What we have done ... it's enormous . . . More than a grand slam,"" he bragged at one point. The recordings suggest Rocha was recruited by the Cubans in Chile in the 70s and may have become a State Department employee expressly to become a covert agent. In the FBI recordings, he says his well-known right-wing persona was part of his cover.

""Iran has begun an airborne attack against Israel,"" National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a Saturday statement. ""The United States will stand with the people of Israel and support their defense against these threats from Iran.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his war cabinet in Tel Aviv, following the announcement of the missile and drone launches, according to the Prime Minister's Office. International leaders including European Council President Charles Michel, U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and France's foreign ministry publicly condemned Iran's attack on Saturday. The Biden administration is expecting Iran to target Israeli government sites, not civilian or religious sites and not U.S. assets in the area, U.S. officials told NBC News. The administration is anticipating the attack to involve 100 drones, dozens of cruise missiles and dozens of ballistic missiles, one of the officials added. Ahead of the attacks on Saturday, President Joe Biden was en route back to the White House, earlier than initially scheduled, to meet with his national security team, including Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, amid the growing prospect of an Iranian strike.

Earlier on Saturday, Iran's Revolutionary Guard seized a Portuguese-flagged cargo ship with links to Israel in the Strait of Hormuz, a key shipping route. The White House condemned the move shortly after. In anticipation of the attacks, airspaces in Israel and throughout the region were being temporarily shut down. Israel also announced that beginning on Sunday, it would close schools and limit gatherings to 1,000 people in certain areas. Strains between Iran and Israel have been heating up since the start of the war in Gaza in October, and especially over the past several weeks after Iran accused Israel of perpetrating an attack on its consulate in Damascus on April 1.

Early users of the technology are already seeing labor productivity gains. For example, Klarna, a buy now, pay later financial services provider, estimates that its AI assistant tool will increase its profit outcome by $40 million by the end of 2024.



""It basically does the job of 700 full-time agents,"" Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in an interview with CNBC. ""It basically was capable of taking care of two-thirds of all the incoming errands that we have over chat.""



Klarna's AI assistant tool is built on OpenAI's systems, which power both ChatGPT and Sora — two products that have captured the attention of both the general public and Congress.

In 2023, members of Congress convened panels, private dinners, and learning sessions with high-profile tech executives including Sam Altman, CEO at OpenAI. The White House followed up by seeking commitment from 15 private industry leaders to help lawmakers understand the best way to identify risks and make use of the new technologies. The list includes some of the biggest players in the tech sector, alongside newcomers such as Anthropic and OpenAI.



The Senate Task Force on AI, established in 2019, has passed at least 15 bills into law that focus on research and risk assessment. But when compared with measures passed by the European Union in 2024, the U.S. regulatory environment appears to be relatively relaxed.



""The folks in Brussels, they come up with a lot of bureaucratic rules that make it harder for companies to innovate,"" Erik Brynjolfsson, a senior fellow at Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI, said in an interview with CNBC. ""The entrepreneurial environment isn't there the way it is in the United States.""



Economists have worried for years that artificial intelligence could sink job prospects for white-collar workers, similar to the effects globalization has had on blue-collar workers in the past. A study from the International Monetary Fund suggests that at least 60% of work in advanced economies would be exposed to changes that stem from the wide adoption of artificial intelligence.



In 2023, lawmakers in the New York State Assembly put forward a measure to limit the expected impact of tech-driven layoffs with robot taxes. The idea is to introduce a cost for companies that use technology to displace workers within the state. As of April 2024, the bill remains in committee with an uncertain future.



Many economists have said that robot taxes, if used at all, should be set at a relatively low level. In the U.S. both employers and employees face payroll taxes of 7.65% of income. But the optimal rate for a robot tax would be between 1% and 3.7%, according to researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.



""It's good for us to have output and productivity. And so I'm not sure we want to tax those,"" said Brynjolfsson. ""Robots are part of what boost technological growth and give us that higher productivity.""

""There will be a time in the future where robots can do most of what humans currently do,"" Brynjolfsson said. ""We're not there yet.""

That number has dropped from 36 in just four years, illustrating how rising home prices have tilted the balance of homeownership toward the wealthiest Americans.

Considering that half of the country's households earn a median of $74,580 or less, these 14 states are some of the few places where middle-income earners can afford a typical home.

To calculate homeownership costs in each U.S. state, Bankrate assumes a 20% down payment, no homeowner association (HOA) fees or mortgage insurance and a 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate of 7.05%. Monthly mortgage payments for each state are based on median sale price data from online broker Redfin.

Here's a look at the 14 states where homes are most affordable, based on the annual income needed to cover homeownership costs without spending more than 28% on housing.

Mississippi: $63,043 Ohio: $64,071 Arkansas: $64,714 Indiana: $65,143 Kentucky: $65,186 Iowa: $65,314 Oklahoma: $65,443 Michigan: $66,343 Missouri: $66,986 Louisiana: $67,886 Alabama: $69,514 Kansas: $72,343 North Dakota: $73,414 West Virginia: $74,957

Median-priced homes in these states cost $300,000 or less, a significant discount compared with the U.S. median price of $402,343.

While these 14 states may have cheaper properties available, there are trade-offs to consider, like higher rates of poverty and fewer high-paying jobs compared with the rest of the country. Many of them are among the most rural in the United States, and incomes in rural areas tend to be lower than in large urban cities.

In contrast, you'd need to make $197,057 to afford a median-priced home worth $739,200 in California — the highest amongst all states.

The median income needed to afford a home in the U.S. overall is $110,871 — up from $76,191 in 2020. This is largely due to a longstanding shortage of homes that was exacerbated by supply chain constraints early in the pandemic. Since 2020, median home prices have risen by 27%, while mortgage rates have nearly doubled.

However, price gains were more dramatic in states where there has been long-running demand for homes, like California and New York. Home prices in rural or Rust Belt states like Mississippi or Michigan have not increased as much as others, making them relatively more affordable for middle-class earners.

Alex Tai | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images

U.S. consumers have been making the move to all-electric vehicles more slowly than many expected — but a growing leader in EV adoption is Hawaii. The tropical island state this year ranks fifth in overall EV adoption at 11.9% of new retail vehicles sold through February, according to J.D. Power. Hawaii also ranks third – behind only California (46.1) and Washington (37) – in J.D. Power's ""EV Adoption Score,"" which is weighted based on market, consumer preference and EV availability, among other conditions, with a score of 33.8.

""We measure adoption relative to availability, meaning shoppers need availability of EVs that meet their needs … before they can even consider adopting,"" said Elizabeth Krear, vice president of the electric vehicle practice at J.D. Power. ""In California, the quantity of EVs is much higher than in Hawaii. But when consumers are given a viable option, 33% are choosing to buy the EV."" Hawaii also is the top state for EV adoption that hasn't agreed to the California Air Resources Board's Zero-Emission Vehicle program, according to J.D. Power. Those rules promote EVs and include stricter vehicle emissions and miles per gallon standards for traditional vehicles in places that have adopted the measure, including the other top five states: California, Washington, Oregon and Colorado.

Why Hawaii?

What's going on in Hawaii that's leading to more consumers opting for EVs? It's a mix of things but mainly high fuel costs, the availability of renewable energy for charging and culture, according to Ivan Drury, director of insights at auto research firm Edmunds, who lives in Waikiki on Hawaii's Oahu Island. ""There is a higher sense of responsibility towards stewarding the land versus most mainland states. If you look up 'Aina' in Hawaiian, you see what I mean, lots of pride for the land,"" he said. Drury also said the popularity of hybrid models in the state (at 19% in 2023) has helped in the switch to EVs, and road trip concerns – a hurdle for some buyers in the U.S. – aren't really a problem in Hawaii. ""We're on an island. No one is really worried about road trips unless they live on the Big Island,"" he said. (For reference, the ""Hawaii Belt"" around the Big Island, or Hawaii Island, is only about 260 miles.) Gasoline prices also play a factor, as they do in other states, such as California. The average price for a gallon of gas in Hawaii is about $4.72, according to AAA. That's the highest in the U.S. other than California and $1.10 higher than the national average of $3.62 a gallon. J.D. Power reports the top-selling EVs in the state are the Tesla Model Y, Tesla Model 3 and Ford F-150 Lightning. ""I'm really happy. I like the car. I like not buying gas,"" said Scott Sageman, a 2021 Tesla Model 3 owner who has lived on Hawaii's Big Island since moving from California in 2020.

Russell Wong, regional vice president of Aloha Kia's seven stores in Hawaii, said customer interest in EVs continues to grow but the vehicles still remain only about 8% of the stores' sales. ""While it is a significant percentage of our current sales compared to other dealers or other markets, it's still a very, very small percentage,"" he said. ""We do see that continuing to climb."" Wong said there's been a lot of interest in Kia's new EV9 SUV that's just arriving to dealerships. The current top-selling EV at the Kia dealerships is the Niro, which also is Kia's least expensive all-electric vehicle, and Aloha Kia has priced it starting at about $36,000.

EV concerns

Although Hawaii is embracing electric vehicles more than some of its peers, it still has many of the same problems with EV adoption that the U.S. mainland does, including lack of charging infrastructure, affordability and a dearth of vehicle choices. A Gallup poll released Monday found less than half of U.S. adults, 44%, say they are either ""seriously considering or might consider"" buying an EV, which is down from 55% in 2023. The proportion not intending to buy an EV has increased from 41% to 48%. Sageman, who lives on the slope of a volcano, said he has not experienced problems charging, as he does so at home, but the estimated range of his Model 3 can be less than expected due to the state's hilly terrain. ""The one thing that I've noticed is you do not pay too much attention to the estimated range,"" he said. ""You're not going to get the same amount if you're doing a lot of uphill driving."" The average cost to a consumer buying an EV from a franchised dealer (excluding Tesla, Rivian and other direst-to-consumer brands) in Hawaii this year is more than $62,600, according to Edmunds. That's down from more than $68,500 last year and roughly $12,700 over the average price of a vehicle in Hawaii.",4/13/2024,-2,0.000833194,0.993971169,0.001281975,0.002104776,0.001208332,0.000600459

Marketed as its Full Self-Driving, or FSD, package, Tesla customers will now pay $99 per month, down from $199 previously.

The price cut is at odds with previous promises from CEO Elon Musk, who has repeatedly said that the cost of FSD would only go up as Tesla adds features and functionality to the system.

""The FSD price will continue to rise as the software gets closer to full self-driving capability with regulatory approval,"" Musk wrote on Twitter, now known as X, on May 18, 2020. He said at that point ""the value of FSD is probably somewhere in excess of $100,000"" per car.

Despite its brand name, the company's FSD option today doesn't make Tesla vehicles autonomous or functional as robotaxis.

Musk has promised shareholders and customers a robotaxi for years, and has said their existing vehicles would soon become self driving after an over-the-air software update.

He told investors on a call in 2019 that autonomous driving would transform Tesla into a company with a $500 billion market cap, up from around $42 billion at that time. (The company is worth over $500 billion today even without having developed an autonomous car.) Tesla raised over $2 billion through debt and equity after the call.

In a notice that's now shown to some drivers through the touchscreen displays in their cars, Tesla says:

""Full Self-Driving (Supervised) can drive your Tesla almost anywhere. It will make lane changes, select forks to follow your navigation route, navigate around other vehicles and objects, and make left and right turns. It must be used with additional caution and an attentive driver. It does not make your vehicle autonomous. Do not become complacent.""

The company uses sensors in the steering wheel and cabin cameras, positioned above the rearview mirror, to determine if a driver is attentive or not, and will audibly alert drivers to keep their eyes on the road or hands on the wheel.

In 2022, the California Department of Motor Vehicles formally accused Tesla of engaging in deceptive practices around the marketing of its driver assistance systems, including its standard package Autopilot and FSD in the U.S., according to filings with a state administrative agency.

Meanwhile, Alphabet -owned Waymo is now operating commercial robotaxi services in several U.S. cities. The company also recently struck a partnership with Uber Eats for driverless food delivery. In China, Didi's autonomous unit operates commercially in markets including Guangzhou. Companies including Bill Gates-backed Wayve in the U.K. and Amazon's Zoox in the U.S. are testing robotaxis as well.

In a push for end-of-quarter sales last month, Musk mandated that all sales and service staff install and demo FSD for customers before handing over the keys. He wrote in an email to employees, ""Almost no one actually realizes how well (supervised) FSD actually works. I know this will slow down the delivery process, but it is nonetheless a hard requirement.""

After that, Tesla also announced it would give away a one-month free trial of FSD to all customers in North America. Owners' responses to the latest version of FSD have been mixed with some fans impressed, and many safety-conscious drivers switching off the free FSD trial, viewing it as inconsistent and unsafe.

Musk also recently promised to ""unveil"" a new dedicated robotaxi on Aug. 8. Tesla unveilings are marketing events, and don't indicate a date for the start of production and deliveries. For example, Tesla unveiled a new version of the Roadster, and a fully electric heavy-duty truck called the Semi in 2017 and didn't begin Semi deliveries until December 2022. It still hasn't produced the new version of the Roadster.

Tesla didn't respond to a request for more information, including whether the price cut announced Friday is permanent or temporary.

494,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/08/this-oil-refiner-could-get-a-boost-as-summer-approaches-using-options-to-capitalize-on-the-gains.html,SLB,Schlumberger,This oil refiner could get a boost as summer approaches. Using options to capitalize on the gains,"It's been a good year for stocks. The S & P 500 is up more than 9% year to date. It's been a better year for energy stocks. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) , which is made up of S & P 500 companies that develop or produce energy products, is up almost 17%. The move higher for energy stocks comes as West Texas Intermediate crude oil approaches the mid-2022 highs of $88.31 per barrel. Brent , while still well below its 2022 highs of $127.98, appears poised to test the late 2023 highs of $96.55 per barrel. Theoretically, one can make bullish bets on oil using an ETF, such as the United States Oil Fund (USO) . However, I would caution against using this as an investment vehicle to make a long-term bullish bet on oil. The reason for this is that there is generally a ""roll-cost,"" as the underlying fund must continuously adjust or ""roll"" near-term oil futures contracts to longer-dated ones. Consequently, USO will not replicate the price of spot precisely and performance will be dragged down over time. So, while it can be used to speculate on short-term price action in the commodity for those who cannot access the futures market, it is wiser to make longer-term investments in companies in the sector or a specific industry within that sector. SPR decline As the chart below illustrates, the country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve declined sharply in the lead-up to the 2022 midterm elections – keeping oil prices in check. As the 2024 general election looms, investors might be concerned the Biden administration could once again access the reserves to put a cap on prices. While oil prices were somewhat kept in check in mid-2022, and the XLE did fall more than 25% between the May highs and mid-July of that year, further depleting the SPR to put a lid on crude can only work for as long as there are reserves to sell. To get exposure to the oil services industry, one could purchase Halliburton or Schlumberger . For the integrated oil companies, Kinder Morgan is a solid midstream pipeline company. For oil refining, one could choose a company such as Valero or Marathon Petroleum . Both of these have been on a tear. Chasing them here, even though summer approaches and gasoline demand should peak soon, is a bit nerve-wracking. In their defense, this is a strong period for gasoline demand. On top of that, the crack spread -- the difference between the price of a barrel of crude oil and the prices of the products it is refined into has also expanded recently. Both of these companies remain attractively priced at 9.5x earnings for Marathon and just 7.4x earnings for Valero. The trade One way to get long exposure with slightly less risk than purchasing the stock is with a diagonal call spread. Purchasing a longer-dated call option and selling higher-strike nearer-dated calls against it to offset some of the decay. The example below is the June 220, May 240 call diagonal in Marathon Petroleum. Note that MPC is expected to report first-quarter earnings on April 30. The Street is expecting $2.44 per quarter, according to FactSet. The stock popped more than 6% on Jan. 30 after Marathon posted fourth-quarter 2023 earnings, so the call I've selected as a sale in the following example is at a strike more than 9% higher than the current stock price -- in the event the stock sees a similar rally. The total cost of the spread risks just under 4.4% of the current stock price. DISCLOSURES: THE ABOVE CONTENT IS SUBJECT TO OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND PRIVACY POLICY .

More than 35 S & P 500 companies reported quarterly results this week, including streaming giant Netflix as well as credit card firm American Express on Thursday and Friday. Overall, stocks are heading for a losing week, with the S & P 500 falling on Friday for a sixth straight day. The earnings season has also been mixed. More than 73% of companies that reported thus far have beaten expectations. However, the blended earnings growth rate — a metric that considers the reports already out and the estimate for those pending — points to a year-over-year profit expansion of just 0.16%. Analysts expected growth of more than 3%, per FactSet. There are some stocks reporting next week that could outperform, however. CNBC Pro screened FactSet data for S & P 500 companies reporting next week that met the following criteria: Earnings per share estimates up 10% in past three and six months Average analyst price target up 10% or more in past three and six months Meta Platforms made the list. Shares have surged more than 40% in 2024. Analysts are also upping their forecasts ahead of the company's first-quarter results on April 24. According to FactSet data, analysts have upwardly revised their earnings estimates by more than 18% over the past three months. Analysts now forecast first-quarter earnings of $4.31 per share, respectively. META YTD mountain Meta Platforms stock. Part of Meta's underlying strength in 2024 can be attributed to higher revenue from advertising on Instagram, which helped profits rise 25% in the fourth-quarter . Investors have also cheered the company's AI push. Meta said on Thursday its artificial intelligence assistant, Meta AI, would be integrated into WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Messenger. Bank of America analyst Justin Post noted Friday that revenue strength from the fourth-quarter should carry over into next week's results, and also underpin a strong second-quarter earnings guide. ""We remain positive on Meta and reiterate our thesis that Reels, Messaging, and AI driven ad improvements are still early, and could lead to positive product surprises & revenue momentum in 2024,"" he said. Analysts are also optimistic on GE Aerospace ahead of first-quarter results on April 23. Analysts polled by FactSet have increased their earnings forecasts by nearly 18% over the past three months, and now expect earnings of 66 cents per share. GE YTD mountain GE Aerospace stock. GE Aerospace started trading on Wall Street earlier in April, after General Electric completed a split into three components compromised of GE Vernova, GE Healthcare and GE Aerospace.

Just under 10% of companies in the S & P 500 have reported their earnings so far, and the period is already off to a good start. Nearly 76% of companies that have reported have beaten earnings expectations, while 59% have come in above analysts' expectations for revenue. A diverse group of companies reports results next week, on track to be the busiest one of the season. Almost 150 companies in the S & P 500 are due to report, including more than one-third of stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . Technology dominate the field, but results will also come from industrials, defense, energy, transportation, telecommunications and pharmaceuticals. Alphabet , Microsoft , Meta Platforms and Tesla are just a few of the headliners slated to release financials. Earnings from Humana , Comcast , Chubb , Visa and Chipotle will give investors more insight on the health of U.S. consumers. A company's earnings results are, of course, integral to both its near- and long-term performance. Results that surprise to the upside often push shares higher, while stocks that miss estimates are in danger of a pullback. As a result, CNPC Pro screened stocks slated to report their earnings next week for those that have a history of beating analysts' expectations. The following stocks have all topped their earnings forecasts with at least a 75% success rate. They've also all averaged a subsequent post-earnings day gain of 2% or more, according to data from Bespoke Investment Group. Magnificent 7 cohort member Meta has topped earnings estimates 87% of the time. The Instagram parent is slated to next announce its quarterly earnings after Wednesday's stock market close. Traditionally, the company's stock has risen 2.3% on average within a day of its earnings announcement. Shares of Meta have soared 40% so far this year, through Wednesday, after almost tripling in 2023. Earlier this month, JPMorgan and Citi both reiterated Meta as a top stock pick, while Piper Sandler stood by an overweight rating on the stock. ""Bigger picture, with the broader online advertising environment strengthening and Meta's multi-year product strategy continuing to come into focus, Meta remains our Top-Pick and we are raising our projections and PT to $590,"" Citi wrote. Another name on the list is ServiceNow , also slated to release quarterly earnings after Wednesday's closing bell. The workflow automation platform beats earnings expectations 89% of the time. Shares of ServiceNow have historically risen 3.3% after posting its earnings, and have gained more than 4% this year after soaring 82% in 2023. Cloud software provider Five9 is the most consistent earnings outperformer on the list, with a record of beating estimates 98% of the time. To date, Five9 has plunged 28% this year, but the company's shares have risen an average of 4.0% following earnings. Five9 is slated to report its earnings next Thursday. Despite its underperformance, Baird in March named the stock its top pick among communications software businesses. ""FIVN remains our top [unified communications] idea, and we like the risk/reward at current levels,"" wrote analyst William Power.

On four straight down sessions, the index was down 2% for the week, as of Wednesday's close. First quarter earnings season is ramping — and so far, the results have been mostly positive. Needham says cost cuts will lead to higher profits at Amazon . The analysts hike their earnings-per-share (EPS) full-year estimate. Club name Amazon reports its quarter on April 30. Micron Technology is about to get $6.1 billion in grants for the federal government's CHIPS Act. It's surprising people, which is odd because Micron is a largely U.S. builder and should be rewarded. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company delivers a very strong quarter. It was initially viewed as positive but then it sold off. Was the EPS beat not enough? The Club's chipmakers are Nvidia and Broadcom . KeyBanc cuts CrowdStrike price target to $376 per share from $430. The analysts point to a survey that says demand may be softer. I do find this hard to believe. In cybersecurity, we own Palo Alto Networks . Piper Sandler raises Conocophillips price target to $157 per share from $145. The three most loved right now are Conoco, Chevron and Diamondback Energy for growth lovers. We like and own Coterra Energ y for the Club. Piper takes Chevron PT to $204 from $180. Two quarters ago, you couldn't give this stock away. Deutsche Bank downgrades Tesla to hold from buy on a thesis-changing pivot. The analysts say robotaxis are not the route to a higher stock price. They say their buy rating on the stock was based on a coming cheaper EV model. That's what the Chinese are doing. What a nightmare. Needham cuts Rivian Automotive price target to $13 per share from $18. The analysts say overall demand weaker and used sales not holding price either. However, they say there's good demand for used. Morgan Stanley double upgrades eBay rating to overweight from underweight (buy from sell) and hikes price target to $62 per share from $35. EBay is like PayPal , enjoying a renaissance. The analysts at Morgan Stanley also take Etsy to a sell-equivalent and cut PT to $55 from $64 on limited frequency growth. Citi hikes ServiceNow price target to $906 per share from $896.

The second quarter is off to a rough start as investors have become increasingly wary about higher-for-longer interest rates and stickier inflation. The S & P 500 is down 1.5% so far this month, while the 30-stock Dow has lost nearly 3% and the Nasdaq has shed 1.1%. Prices of most commodities, from gold to crude oil, have also increased to new highs in recent weeks, adding to investors' worries. Investors' are therefore looking to Wednesday's consumer price index release — which gauges the average change over time in the prices people pay for goods and services — for further clues on the state of inflation. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect inflation to have increased 0.3% in March on a month-over-month basis. Wall Street will also use the report to assess how many times the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. If the data points to easing price pressures, rate cut expectations will rise. Otherwise, investors will price rate reductions out of the market. Against this market backdrop, we used the CNBC Pro Stock Screener to search for stocks with the pricing power and cost controls to handle a potential inflation reacceleration. These names have also showed reliable earnings growth during the post-pandemic inflation spike. Additionally, they have low debt and strong balance sheets that should keep the company resilient if interest rates rise. Here's the criteria these stocks meet: They have among the highest gross margins in the S & P 500, at above 60%. Their annual earnings per share growth over the last three years is more than 15%. Their debt-to-equity ratio is less than 40%. Take a look at the list of companies below: At 143.2%, digital workflow company ServiceNow has the highest projected three-year earnings per share growth of the list and a fairly low debt-to-equity ratio of 19.5%. Shares have gained 10.1% this year, fueled by enthusiasm around its expanded generative AI services. Stifel analyst Brad Reback kept his buy rating ahead of ServiceNow's first-quarter earnings slated for April 24. ""Looking forward, our checks pointed to better-than-expected 2Q deal pipelines,"" Reback wrote in an April 3 note. ""Large enterprises who had historically been averse to 3rd party solutions and relied on home-grown ITSM/ITOM platforms, are beginning to make the shift to ServiceNow's product set given the reliability, sustainability, and breadth of solutions found within the platform."" Arista Networks has zero debt and a gross margin of nearly 62%, making it a favored stock during times of high inflation. Shares of the computer networking company have jumped more than 23% this year, and its earnings are expected to grow 48.8% over the next three years, per the CNBC Pro Stock Screener tool. The consensus rating on the stock is a buy, per LSEG. However, the average price target implies upside of less than 2%. Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on the stock in a March 22 note. The firm also raised its price target on Arista from $313 to $356 due to higher confidence in its consensus revised estimates for 2024/2025, citing Arista's continued growth in its AI-related products and growing capital expenditures from 'cloud titan' customers who could support the company's revenue guidance. Nvidia also made the list, even though the stock has seen a 6.2% pullback this quarter. The darling chipmaker has gross profit margin of 72.7% and high levels of earnings growth. Other stocks that made the cut are Cadence Design Systems , Intuitive Surgical and Old Dominion Freight Line .",4/9/2024,-2,0.000556368,0.000818813,0.000266621,0.003346553,0.994511843,0.00049983

The Dow Jones and S&P both hit all time highs with the Dow Jones closing over 38,000 points for the first time ever as stocks continue to rise. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)

The S&P 500 closed slightly lower Friday, but clinched weekly gains as the latest economic data added to a positive picture of the economy.

The broad market index inched down by 0.07% to 4,890.97. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.36% to 15,455.36, hurt by a post-earnings slide in Intel . The Dow Jones Industrial Average bucked the trend by adding 60.30 points, or 0.16%, to 38,109.43, an all-time closing high. All three major averages are now up more than 100% from their pandemic lows.

Despite Friday's mixed session, the major averages recorded a winning week. The S&P 500 advanced around 1.1%, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed about 0.9%. The blue-chip Dow gained approximately 0.7%.

Friday's losses ended a six-day winning streak for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Through the end of Thursday's session, the benchmark S&P 500 had closed at a record high for five straight trading days, the longest streak of its kind since November 2021.

Stocks got a boost this week from encouraging economic data.

December's core personal consumption expenditures price index came in line with economists' forecasts month over month, but was slightly lower than anticipated on an annualized basis, data released Friday shows. It's a preferred gauge of inflation for the Federal Reserve, which sets monetary policy.

Friday's PCE print came a day after gross domestic product data revealed higher-than-expected economic growth in the fourth quarter. That bolstered investors' hopes that the economy has avoided a deep recession.

""All the economic data — both the GDP and PCE — was good this week,"" said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Spouting Rock Asset Management. ""That was comforting to everybody. And I think it does show we're still in this potential 'Goldilocks' landing, where the economy softens a bit but is still positive.""

But sell-offs among some well-known stocks on the back of earnings reports restricted gains this week.

Chipmaker Intel tumbled nearly 12% on Friday after offering a disappointing fiscal first-quarter outlook. KLA slid more than 6% in the session after the semiconductor company posted light guidance for its fiscal third quarter.

On the other hand, American Express rallied more than 7% after sharing a better-than-expected forecast for full-year earnings. That helped the 30-stock Dow mitigate losses from Intel's drop.

Elsewhere, Tesla , a retail investor darling, registered its worst week since October, declining 13.6% in the period. Shares took a leg down after the electric vehicle maker posted disappointing earnings and warned of trouble in 2024.",1/25/2024,0,0.029055147,0.91609931,0.003171481,0.034592256,0.014456956,0.002624856

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Tuesday, pulling back from record-breaking highs as traders pored through the latest batch of corporate earnings.

The blue-chip Dow slid 96.36 points, or 0.25%, to 37,905.45, retreating below the 38,000 level that was crossed for the first time on Monday. Tuesday's losses ended a three-day winning streak.

The S&P 500 rose by 0.29% to 4,864.60, a fresh all-time closing high. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.43% to 15,425.94.

The 30-stock Dow was pressured by an 11% decline in 3M following disappointing guidance. Johnson & Johnson fell 1.6% after reporting earnings.

D.R. Horton dropped more than 9% after the homebuilder missed Wall Street's consensus forecast for per-share earnings. Lockheed Martin slipped more than 4% following a weak outlook for full-year earnings per share.

On the other hand, United Airlines rose more than 5% after reporting strong fourth-quarter results. However, the airline operator said it expects a first-quarter loss from the grounding of Boeing 737 Max 9 airplanes, the model involved in the Alaska Airlines emergency earlier this month.

Shares of other airline operators rose in tandem. Southwest Airlines climbed more than 3%, while American Airlines , Delta Air Lines and Alaska added more than 2%.

Elsewhere, Verizon and Procter & Gamble helped mitigate losses for the Dow. The pair gained more than 6% and 4%, respectively, as investors bought in following the companies' financial reports.

Those moves come after the S&P 500 officially entered a new bull market, topping its previous closing all-time high from January 2022.

But investors are deliberating how long the gains can persist, especially as the rally this year has centered around technology stocks such as Nvidia , lacking broader participation. This month alone, Nvidia is up 20%. In contrast, the small-cap Russell 2000 is lower by more than 2%.

""Investors definitely are taking a pause — doing some profit taking — on the heels of what was a really a two-year record high,"" said Greg Bassuk, CEO of AXS Investments, of Tuesday's moves. ""That's counterbalancing the bullishness in the markets.""

Traders are also awaiting two key data economic data releases later in the week. The preliminary fourth-quarter gross domestic product figure is due Thursday, followed by the Commerce Department's closely-watched personal consumption expenditures price index for December on Friday.

Investors will monitor Netflix earnings after the bell on Tuesday. Technology remains a focus later in the week, with IBM and Tesla slated for Wednesday and Intel expected Thursday. Outside of tech, results from American, Alaska and Southwest are also due Thursday.

Palantir CEO Alex Karp said some staffers at his software company have exited due to his public support for Israel. And he expects to see more walk out the door. ""We've lost employees. I'm sure we'll lose employees,"" Karp said in an interview Wednesday with CNBC's ""Money Movers."" ""If you have a position that does not cost you ever to lose an employee, it's not a position."" Karp was responding to a question from anchor Sara Eisen about personnel turnover at the company resulting from its controversial stances.

Palantir, known for its government contract work in defense and intelligence, has provided its technology to support the Ukrainian and Israeli militaries in their respective wars. Israel has vowed to defeat Hamas following the Palestinian militant group's rampage on Oct. 7 in southern Israel that killed nearly 1,200 people. More than 30,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the war began, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry there. Karp said on Palantir's earnings call last month he was ""exceedingly proud that after Oct. 7, within weeks, we are on the ground and we are involved in operationally crucial operations in Israel."" Palantir held its first board meeting of the year in Tel Aviv, Israel, in January, after which the company agreed to a ""strategic partnership"" with the Israeli Ministry of Defense to supply the country with technology for its military efforts. In November, Karp asserted the company's support of the U.S. government and Israel, declaring on an earnings call that ""Palantir only supplies its products to Western allies."" In Wednesday's interview, Karp reaffirmed his pro-Israel views. Eisen referenced the company's decision in October to take out a full-page ad in The New York Times, stating it ""stands with Israel.""

Mark Felix | Afp | Getty Images

HOUSTON — The crisis in the Red Sea could lead to a shortage in the global tanker fleet if disruptions persist for another six months, the CEO of Kuwait Petroleum Corporation told CNBC. Houthi militants have been striking commercial shipping in the Red Sea since November in support of Palestinians as Israel wages war in Gaza. The attacks have forced many container shipping and tanker companies to divert traffic around the Cape of Good Hope in southern Africa, adding time and cost. ""One of the things I think we may be concerned about is if this continues for another six months, that we will not have perhaps the tanker fleet available to continue to go around,"" Shaikh Nawaf al-Sabah said of the global fleet during an interview at the CERAWeek by S&P Global energy conference.

KPC has diverted a substantial amount of production around the Cape during the crisis, al-Sabah said, declining to provide specific numbers. The company is continuing to ship through the Red Sea and is making decisions on which route ships should take on a daily basis, he said. ""We maintain a strategic tanker tanker fleet for these types of reasons,"" al-Sabah said. ""We're comfortable that we can supply our customers in the quantities that are required on time without issue, but I don't know how many other producers have that strategic vision."" Al-Sabah does not see a risk of Middle East tensions leading to a conflict that could disrupt crude supplies in the wider region. The Persian Gulf has faced numerous wars but the only time Kuwait has been unable to ship was during Iraq dictator Saddam Hussein's invasion of the country in 1990, he said. ""I don't see a supply fear,"" the CEO said. ""I am confident that the industry and the system is well equipped to handle potential supply crises that might happen."" Chevron CEO Michael Wirth, however, said the security situation in the Middle East is ""tenuous"" and ""could pivot on a dime."" Wirth told CNBC that Chevron is ""not moving ships to the Red Sea."" ""Today the conflict in Israel and Gaza goes on, a resolution does not seem to be at hand and the regional risks continue to be high,"" Wirth told CNBC's Brian Sullivan at CERAWeek

Didi Global, the Chinese ride-hailing company, must face a lawsuit in a U.S. court claiming it defrauded investors by concealing and disobeying a Chinese government order to postpone its 2021 initial public offering until it resolved cybersecurity and privacy concerns.

In a 54-page decision on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan federal court said investors who brought the proposed class action sufficiently pleaded that Didi and various officials intended to defraud them in raising more than $4.4 billion in the June 30, 2021 IPO.

The offering valued all of Didi at about $67.5 billion.

Kaplan said the alleged desire to sell American depositary shares before a looming government crackdown on Chinese technology companies gave Didi and the officials a ""concrete and personal economic motive"" to go public before ""the window for high valuation Chinese IPOs in the United States"" closed.

After a pandemic-induced lull spanning more than three years, mainland Chinese are snapping up homes in Hong Kong, accounting for up to a third of new property sales weeks after the city removed all additional stamp duties on foreign buyers.

The surge of mainland Chinese buyers into one of the world's most expensive housing markets — reported by several property agents and developers — comes amid battered confidence in the mainland's housing market due to a debt crisis and an uncertain economic outlook.

Mainland Chinese now account for 20% to 30% of new home sales, according to estimates by realtors, with some buyers recently purchasing up to eight apartments at once.

Hong Kong in late February removed all additional stamp duties, including those for purchases of second properties, as well as duties on those selling flats within two years of buying them. Foreigners, who had to pay 15% tax since October, from 30% previously, now pay around 4.25%, on par with locals.

The reversal of what was deemed an unsuccessful government push during the 2010s to cool housing prices came after Hong Kong housing prices plunged more than 20% from their 2021 peak due to higher mortgage rates, an outflow of talent and a weak market outlook.",3/20/2024,0,0.068854943,0.041666888,0.00222982,0.625624895,0.258722395,0.002901033

Now they have another incentive to promote it: artificial intelligence.

While generative AI has grown at lightning speed, nuclear power projects are heavily regulated and usually advance at a plodding pace. That's raising questions about whether advances in nuclear energy can cut emissions as swiftly as energy-guzzling AI and other fast-growing technologies are adding to them.

""If you were to integrate large language models, GPT-style models into search engines, it's going to cost five times as much environmentally as standard search,"" said Sarah Myers West, managing director of the AI Now Institute, a research group focused on the social impacts of AI. At current growth rates, some new AI servers could soon gobble up more than 85 terawatt hours of electricity each year, researchers have estimated — more than some small nations' annual energy consumption.

""I want to see innovation in this country,"" Myers West said. ""I just want the scope of innovation to be determined beyond the incentive structures of these giant companies.""

Oklo is one of the nuclear startups backed by Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI who has described AI and cheap, green energy as mutually reinforcing essentials to achieving a future marked by ""abundance.""

""Fundamentally today in the world, the two limiting commodities you see everywhere are intelligence, which we're trying to work on with AI, and energy,"" he told CNBC in 2021 after investing $375 million in Helion Energy, a nuclear fusion startup that Altman chairs. Microsoft last year agreed to buy power from Helion starting in 2028. Oklo, which Altman also chairs, is focused on the opposite reaction, fission, which generates energy by splitting an atom; fusion does so by merging atomic nuclei.

Representatives for Altman, through his special acquisition company AltC, didn't respond to a request for comment.

In rural southeastern Idaho, Oklo is working to build a small-scale nuclear powerhouse that could fuel data centers like the ones OpenAI and its competitors need. But the company also wants to supply mixed-use communities and industrial facilities, and is already contracted to build two commercial plants in southern Ohio.

As the United States moves toward wide-scale electric vehicle adoption and decarbonization, ""the amount of energy we're going to need to do that is huge,"" said Oklo CEO and co-founder Jacob DeWitte. ""Also heating and cooking — if we want to electrify those processes, you're going to need even more.""

Oklo has found getting regulators on board harder than finding potential customers.

In 2022, the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees commercial nuclear power plants and materials, denied the company's application for the design of its Idaho ""Aurora"" powerhouse, saying it hadn't provided enough safety information. In October, the Air Force rescinded its intent to award a contract for a microreactor pilot program to power a base in Alaska.

""You've got new physics, you have to use new models. You have to do all sorts of stuff that's different than what they're used to,"" DeWitte said of the NRC. Oklo is now working to satisfy regulators, he said, acknowledging agency officials must ""do their independent job of ensuring this meets adequate safety requirements.""

Oklo's proposed 13,000 square-foot Aurora powerhouse, featuring a 15-megawatt fission reactor, is smaller than earlier plants and looks more like a sleek ski chalet than the Cold War-era ones with their iconic curved towers. The plant set to be built at the Idaho National Laboratory, a research facility where Oklo has been given an Energy Department grant to test recycling nuclear waste into new fuel. DeWitte says the design is safer, too, citing the use of liquid metal as a coolant rather than water.

The nuclear power industry hasn't meaningfully expanded its share of the U.S. energy mix for decades. It has chugged along despite popular opposition fueled by infrequent but devastating accidents like those in Chernobyl, Ukraine, in 1986 and in Fukushima, Japan, in 2011. But as the climate crisis accelerates, most Americans now support expanding nuclear energy — 57%, up from 43% in 2020, a Pew Research survey found last year.

Nuclear power currently makes up only 19% of the nation's overall energy generation, with 93 commercial reactors operating today, down from a peak of 112 in 1990. By one estimate, up to 800 gigawatts of new nuclear power will be needed by 2050 to meet current green energy targets.",3/7/2024,0,0.004421361,0.962127209,0.001587965,0.025599776,0.005247253,0.001016431

A federal judge's order blocking a $3.8 billion-dollar deal that would have JetBlue Airways purchase rival Spirit Airlines leaves Spirit with an uncertain future. But the ruling didn't just leave the airlines with uncertainty; it sent shudders through some of Spirit's key constituencies.

Few places will feel the impact harder than the Arnold Palmer Regional Airport (LBE) if Spirit can't keep flying. About an hour east of downtown Pittsburgh in the city of Latrobe, Pennsylvania, the airport serves the gritty coal towns east of Pittsburgh but also lures in travelers from a three-state area with free parking, short TSA lines, and low fares from Spirit. The Arnold Palmer Regional Airport has almost all the amenities of any major airport, just on a smaller scale. There's a baggage claim, car rental counters, and DeNuzio's Chophouse to feed travelers while waiting for their flight. But all the travelers in the passenger area hold boarding passes for one airline: Spirit.

That is because Spirit Airlines is the only commercial carrier to provide service to LBE.

""Being that they are the only one, they are really important; it would be devastating if they would go belly up,"" said Gabe Monzo, executive director of the airport.

Spirit has trimmed its schedule at LBE from several daily flights to one direct flight to Orlando.

But Monzo says service will likely resume to Myrtle Beach in the spring.

A 2022 study by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation put the regional economic impact of arriving and departing passengers from LBE at $213.9 million. Monzo says $100 million of that is from Spirit Airlines travelers.

Spirit's bargain-basement fare fliers

LBE won't be the only one left in the lurch if Spirit can't find a path forward.

Spirit Airlines fills a niche for leisure travelers, college students, missionaries, and others seeking bargain basement, no-frills fares.

Professor Jase Ramsey, a Florida Gulf Coast University management professor in Fort Myers, has two stakes in Spirit Airlines: he uses the airline for family vacations from service at nearby Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW), and incorporates Spirit into his courses.

From a family perspective, he said a Florida without Spirit hurts in two directions. Its absence from the market will likely raise prices for incoming tourists from the north. But it will also cut off affordable vacation options for South Florida families heading to the Caribbean.

""This will be bad for our region if something happens to Spirit from a price perspective. They are usually our low-cost leader. If you want to do a family vacation out of here, that is your go-to airline,"" Ramsey said.",1/21/2024,0,0.016739758,0.048043273,0.002038764,0.734032512,0.197559074,0.001586613

Delta forecast full-year earnings per share of $6 to $7, below its previous estimate of more than $7 per share for 2024.

Other major airlines including United , American and Southwest also fell on the new estimate, released alongside quarterly earnings. United and American were down about 10% each, while Southwest fell more than 4%.

Delta finished 2023 by doubling its quarterly profit as bookings, both for corporate and leisure travel, continued to pick up from the Covid-19 pandemic lows. The company reported $2.04 billion in net income in the fourth quarter, sharply up from the $828 million reported in the year-ago period.

Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a CNBC interview that the airline has recovered almost 90% of its travel demand from its pre-pandemic numbers. Bastian said he expects strong growth in international travel as Americans continue to set their sights on overseas destinations.

""We expect to see an inflection point in the first part of this new year, in terms of our domestic unit revenues turning positive,"" Bastian said.

Delta is coming off a strong 2023 where shares surged more than 20%, but the stock is still down from its all-time high of $63.16, notched in July 2019. The stock closed Friday at $38.47 per share.

It's another example of how Boeing's customers say the manufacturer's production problems and safety crisis are impacting their growth plans. The offer comes after United and other airlines in recent years have clamored for more pilots when the Covid-19 pandemic travel slump ended and demand surged.

""Due to recent changes to our Boeing deliveries, the remaining 2024 forecast block hours for United have been significantly reduced,"" the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association, the pilots' union, said in a note to members Friday. ""While the delivery issues surround our 787 and 737 fleets, the impact will affect other fleets as well.""

United confirmed the request for voluntary, unpaid time off. The airline previously said it would pause pilot hiring this spring because of aircraft arriving late from Boeing, CNBC reported last month.

The union said it expects United to offer more time off ""for the summer bid periods and potentially into the fall.""

United was contracted to receive 43 Boeing 737 Max 8 planes and 34 Max 9 models this year, but now expects to receive 37 and 19, respectively, according to a company filing in February. It had expected Boeing would also hand over 80 Max 10s this year and 71 next year. That model hasn't yet been certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, and the airline removed them from the delivery schedule because it is ""unable to accurately forecast the expected delivery period,"" it said in the filing.

United CEO Scott Kirby has been among the most vocal about the production problems and delivery delays at Boeing, including most recently the crisis stemming from a door plug that blew out of a nearly new Boeing 737 Max 9 operated by an Alaska Airlines flight that was at about 16,000 feet.

Other airlines bosses have also grown frustrated with the delivery delays resulting from Boeing's manufacturing issues.

Southwest Airlines last month said it was reevaluating its 2024 financial guidance, citing fewer Boeing deliveries, and has paused pilot and flight attendant hiring, while Alaska Airlines said its 2024 capacity estimates are ""in flux due to uncertainty around the timing of aircraft deliveries as a result of increased Federal Aviation Administration and Department of Justice scrutiny on Boeing and its operations.""

Boeing declined to comment.

American Airlines on Thursday posted a $19 million profit for the last three months of 2023, topping Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines. Shares of the company rose more than 10% on Thursday. Here's how American performed in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared with Wall Street estimates compiled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv: Earnings per share: 29 cents adjusted vs. 10 cents expected.

29 cents adjusted vs. 10 cents expected. Revenue: $13.06 billion vs. $13.02 billion expected. For the last three months of 2023, American Airlines reported net income of $19 million, down nearly 98% from $803 million the year prior. Earnings per share decreased to 3 cents from $1.14 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Adjusting for one-time items, including the impact of a new labor agreement with the airline's pilots, American earned 29 cents per share. In its third-quarter earnings report, the airline had estimated it would break even for the December period.

""We're really pleased with the results, we closed out the year strong,"" CEO Robert Isom told CNBC's Phil LeBeau on Thursday. ""At American, we're focused on reliability, profitability and really strengthening our balance sheet. We've done all of those ... I think that we're going to have a really busy first and second quarter, and I think the time to buy is right now for travel. It's going to be a busy year."" Looking ahead, American said it expects a net loss per share of between 15 cents and 35 cents, adjusted, for the first quarter of 2024. Costs, excluding fuel, are projected to rise between 2% and 4% for the period, with flying capacity up between 6.5% and 8.5%.

For full-year 2024, American expects adjusted earnings per share of $2.25 to $3.25 with flying capacity up mid-single digits over 2023. In a letter to American team members, Isom said the strength of the business meant all U.S. and Canada-based employees will receive a profit-sharing payment in March. The earnings report comes on a busy day for the airline industry, with Southwest and Alaska also reporting fourth-quarter earnings Thursday.

United Airlines shares rose about 5% on Tuesday after the company reported higher-than-expected earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter.

The carrier hit its full-year adjusted earnings target of between $10 and $12 a share in 2023 and said bookings so far in 2024 have been solid.

The report kicks off a busy week of airline earnings reports, with quarterly updates from American , Southwest and Alaska all due out on Thursday.

Shares of those three carriers were each up about 3% Tuesday. Shares of Delta, which reported fourth-quarter earnings earlier this month, were also up about 3%.

United forecast a first-quarter loss due to the grounding of Boeing 737 Max 9 planes this month but CEO Scott Kirby told CNBC in an interview Tuesday that the airline is seeing an increase in business travel in 2024.

""It's only two weeks into the year, but we have seen a step up in business travel. We're back now in terms of revenue, at least above where we were in 2019,"" Kirby told CNBC's Phil LeBeau.

512,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/14/heres-why-warren-buffett-calls-airline-stocks-hazardous-to-your-investment-health-.html,LUV,Southwest Airlines,Here's why Warren Buffett calls airline stocks hazardous to your investment health,"With a midair emergency, disappointing profit forecast and more aircraft groundings after only two weeks, the airline industry is already off to a turbulent 2024. That only vindicates Warren Buffett, who dumped $4 billion worth of airline stocks in the pandemic and will most likely never give the industry another chance. Buffett, chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway and renowned as the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" has long said the airline business suffers from a low-margin, capital-intensive model as well as additional risks stemming from forces outside its control, like the price of jet fuel and geopolitical uncertainty. ""It's a labor intensive, capital intensive, largely commodity-type business,"" Buffett said during the annual meeting of Berkshire shareholders in 2013. ""That's been a deathtrap for investors."" Being a leader of an airline is also a thankless, burdensome job since so many problems can arise, Buffett said. ""I mean, believe me, no joy being a CEO of an airline,"" he said in 2020. ""It's a very, very, very difficult business because you're dealing with millions of people every day and if something goes wrong for 1% of them, they are very unhappy."" Buffett, one of the world's biggest dealmakers with mountains of cash on hand, said he's been approached many times by investors wanting to start an airline business. But the entreaties only turned off Buffett. ""I've had probably a dozen proposals over the last 25 or 30 years from people that that want to get into the airline business ... and a number of them have. It's sexy for some reason,"" Buffett said in 2013. As Buffett's late business partner Charlie Munger once quipped: ""You really couldn't create another railroad, but you can create another airline. And that's what we don't like about it."" Selling airlines In 2020, Buffett revealed that Berkshire sold all of its equity holdings in the U.S. airline industry. That included stakes worth a combined $4 billion in all four legacy carriers — United Airlines , American Airlines , Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines . Buffett said at the time that the pandemic might have fundamentally changed the industry. ""The world has changed for the airlines. And I don't know how it's changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way,"" Buffett said then. ""I don't know if Americans have now changed their habits or will change their habits"" as a result of the shutdown, the prolonged Covid outbreak and canceled travel plans. Back then, many Buffett watchers were left disappointed as shares of those carriers soon staged an epic rebound, more than doubling from their 2020 lows. Even former President Donald Trump weighed in on the trade, saying that Buffett has been right ""his whole life"" but made a mistake selling airlines. However, Buffett might still get the last laugh since, despite their bounce off the lows, the carriers never fully recovered from the pandemic damage. In fact, the U.S. Global JETS ETF (JETS), which tracks 50 U.S. and international airlines, remains about 40% below pre-Covid levels in 2019. 'Bad century out of the way’ Buffett shocked many when he returned to the industry in 2016, buying 10% of the four largest U.S. airlines. By that time, he had avoided the sector for a decade and had been so opposed to investing there that he told shareholders in a 2007 letter that ""if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down."" One exception during that prior decade came when Berkshire bought NetJets, which sells fractional ownerships shares in private business jets, for $725 million in 1998 When Buffett broke his own rule to buy the airline stakes in 2016, he chose to believe that the industry had finally strengthened after being plagued by bankruptcies throughout in the 20th century. ""It's true that the airlines had a bad 20th century. They're like the Chicago Cubs. And they got that bad century out of the way, I hope,"" Buffett said i n an CNBC interview at the time. ""The hope is they will keep [aircraft] orders in reasonable relationship to potential demand."" Bumpy ride all along The legendary investor's first investing experience with the industry was buying more than $350 million of USAir convertible preferred stock in 1989 . Initially Berkshire took a bath on the USAir holding, but it eventually just about broke even. But Buffett was chastened. ""It could've been worse, but it was a mistake,"" Buffett said at Berkshire's 1995 annual meeting . In the following year's shareholder letter, in 1996 , Buffett repeated an old joke about investing in airlines: ""When Richard Branson, the wealthy owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways, was asked how to become a millionaire, he had a quick answer: 'There's really nothing to it. Start as a billionaire and then buy an airline.'""",1/14/2024,0,0.199591741,0.007743211,0.001210384,0.783496022,0.007234836,0.000723772

Here's a recap of Wednesday's key moments. 1. U.S. stocks climbed Wednesday, rebounding after the market suffered one of its worst sessions in the past year. Equities declined on Tuesday after key inflation data came in hotter than expected for January. The reaction was a surge in bond yields and a delay in when the market thought the Federal Reserve would start cutting interest rates. June is now the betting favorite. Jim Cramer said it was a ""needed sell-off"" after recent highs. Expect more important inflation data on Friday. 2. The Club is looking to buy more shares of high-quality names after early-week losses. ""I'm itching to buy some of them that have been really crushed,"" Jim said, citing Starbucks and Stanley Black & Decker. We've been sitting on a lot of cash, and waiting for stocks to pull back to capitalize on any weakness. Both companies have solid fundamentals and long-term growth prospects but are underperforming the market year-to-date. 3. Wall Street continues touting Palo Alto Networks on Wednesday. Morgan Stanley expects solid quarterly earnings from the cybersecurity leader, citing positive survey work and channel conversations. However, analysts said they would not be aggressive buyers ahead of next week's release of fiscal results. That's because estimates are unlikely to move much higher and the stock's valuation is already above its historical average. It's hard to argue with a stock up roughly 25% year to date after more than doubling in 2023. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long PANW, SWK, SBUX . See here for a full list of the stocks.)

Following the trade, Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust will own 740 shares of SWK, increasing its weighting in the portfolio to 2.27% from 2.10%. We are making a small buy of SWK, slightly violating our average cost basis of $90.22. Shares are down about 4% year to date as many of the late 2023 ""broadening out"" rally winners have taken a slide since the recent bounce in interest rates. Shares of this hand tool maker tend to have an inverse relationship with rates because of its ties to the housing market, especially existing home sales. The concept is simple: When people move into an older home, they are more likely to put more money into it and take on remodeling projects. Some of Stanley Black & Decker's leading brands are DeWalt, Black + Decker and Craftsman. Even though the stock is down slightly this year, we see more signs that the home improvement market will rebound after a tough few years. Piper Sandler reinforced this call earlier Tuesday in a detailed note when it upgraded its rating on Home Depot . The main reason for Piper Sandler's call is stabilizing home equity extraction, which is when a homeowner takes out equity from the value of their home through a loan— extra cash often used to fund a large remodeling project. As Piper points out, home equity extractions have declined because of higher interest rates. However, analysts think it will return to growth in the first quarter of this year based on improving mortgage refinance applications. And if mortgage rates stabilize at these levels, Piper thinks extractions will grow ""modestly"" this year. The real bullish trend will be if rates fall even further, creating what Piper calls a ""meaningful"" extraction cycle considering the firm's estimate of a near-record $10.6 trillion of tappable equity. All of this is very positive for the home improvement industry at large and Stanley Black & Decker, a company that has spent the past year and a half working down excess inventory which, when finished, will give its margins a clean start ahead of a potential upcycle.

Here's a recap of Thursday's key moments. 1. U.S. stocks bounced on Thursday, one day after slumping on Fed talk that an interest rate cut was unlikely in March. We worried this would happen because the market got ahead itself on the number of expected rate cuts in 2024. This is why we built up a war chest of cash throughout the month. Meanwhile, investors continue digesting quarterly earnings, with Club names Apple , Amazon and Meta Platforms set to post results after the bell. Jim Cramer said Thursday that members should be aware that the iPhone maker will likely guide down on softer China sales. But as we said earlier this week , Apple's growth prospects and solid fundamentals leave us bullish long term. 2. Stanley Black & Decker posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings per share before the opening bell Thursday. But it missed on revenue and the full-year EPS guide midpoint was below estimates. The stock was falling 4%. The Club holding, however, continues to show progress on cost initiatives as management gets rid of excess high-cost inventory. Jim said it's a perfect time to buy this industrial stock on the dip. Shares should run up once the Fed starts lowering rates — likely later this year — and mortgage rates fall. This will give people more confidence to improve their homes themselves or hire contractors, which should lead to increased demand for the tools that Stanley Black & Decker makes. 3. Honeywell shares were down nearly 4% after the industrial giant's earnings release. We took the dip as a buying opportunity , remaining upbeat because of its better-than-expected segment margin performance and cash flow generation. Although the results weren't stellar, Jim said management's full-year guidance was conservative and beatable. ""This is a major opportunity"" to buy the stock's unwarranted sell-off, Jim said.

The stock reversed higher despite conservative guidance. Lowe's is more levered to do-it-yourself projects, which continue to be soft. CEO Marvin Ellison was basically saying ""January was week,"" Jim Cramer said Tuesday. But Cramer said January is often a weak month. Cramer said Stanley Black & Decker , a holding the CNBC Investing Club portfolio, is a buy off these Lowe's numbers. Macy's : The department store chain reported better than expected quarter but offered conservative guidance that missed forecast. The company, which has Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury under its umbrella, said it's leaning into these higher-end brands and reducing the Macy's store footprint. ""Macy's, I'm really warming up to,"" Cramer said, explaining that former CEO Jeff Gennette did good things for the company and current CEO Tony Spring is continuing the work. In retail, the Club owns Costco and off-price retailer TJX , which might find it tougher to find good merchandise as the industry moves away from promotion, Cramer said.

Unity Software : The platform for video game creators issued weak guidance amid concerns about market share loss. Unity announced 1,800 cuts jobs last month as part of a corporate restructuring plan. Competitor Applovin is kind of crushing Unity, Cramer said. Workday : The provider of enterprise cloud applications for finance and human resources reported a better-than-expected quarter but its guidance was softer. Cramer said Workday, ServiceNow and Club holding Salesforce are the ""three best software-as-a-service companies in the world."" He added, ""I feel pretty good about Workday.""",2/27/2024,0,0.345384896,0.114231288,0.009468224,0.503979385,0.025458712,0.001477472

Here's a recap of Wednesday's key moments. 1. U.S. stocks edged higher Wednesday ahead of Thursday's important December consumer price index. Among the S & P 500 and the Dow , the tech-heavy Nasdaq was the best performer — helped by gains in Club names Microsoft , Amazon and Nvidia . In fact, Nvidia rose more than 2% higher Wednesday, pushing further into record-high territory. U.S. oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate added about 65 cents a barrel, to nearly $73, while natural gas futures slid more than 5% after a hot start to the year. 2. Analysts at Morgan Stanley on Wednesday doubled down on Palo Alto Networks as their top idea in cybersecurity and lifted their price target on the stock to $375 per share from $304. The firm said it expects 2024 to be a ""banner year"" for the cybersecurity industry for a host of reasons, including an elevated threat environment and the Securities and Exchange Commission's new disclosure rules . Shares of the Club holding jumped more than 4% on Wednesday and were on pace for their third straight day of gains following a seven-session skid that began in the final days of 2023. After making a small, disciplined trim last week to lock in profits on a 2023 standout, we don't envision another Palo Alto sale anytime soon. 3. In a potential readthrough to Club holding Stanley Black & Decker , Wedbush Securities upgraded Home Depot to buy with a $380-per-share price target. The research firm previously had a hold-equivalent rating and price target of $330 on the retailer. Wedbush's newfound bullishness is tied to its belief that home-improvement spending will return to growth by the second half of this year. This could bode well for Stanley Black & Decker if Home Depot customers — both on the professional and do-it-yourself sides — direct some of their dollars to the Club holding's tool brands such as DeWalt and Craftsman.

(We're no longer recording the audio, so we can get this new written feature to members as quickly as possible.) As we gear up for the CNBC Investing Club's annual meeting on Saturday, I asked Jim Cramer for some quick thoughts on some of the day's portfolio movers. "" Ford seems really interesting as the electric vehicle market slows down,"" Jim said. One of the key points from Ford's fourth quarter was a greater push into hybrid vehicle production with a pullback EV spend. "" Disney 's strategy is too much like Warner Bros. Discovery for my liking,"" Jim said. ""They need some sort of change agent there,"" he added, alluding to the proxy battle between Disney and Train's Nelson Peltz. ""Lost in all the semi talk is the continued strength of Costco . I think we can hold it,"" Jim said. ""But I think that Stanley Black & Decker has gotten too cheap versus everything else in the sector."" ""I don't want to get too excited but the way Starbucks and Estee Lauder trade it is like China has hit bottom,"" Jim said. We'll be running through many more of the stocks in the Club portfolio during Saturday's meeting, which members can watch live starting at 1:30 p.m. ET on our website . Conference call update : Coterra Energy reported earnings Thursday evening but held its conference call Friday morning. The main takeaway from the call was that the oil and natural gas producer has plenty of flexibility to shift investment to where it will generate the highest return. For 2024, that means pulling back on natural gas production and focusing on oil. While the near-term fundamentals around nat gas look bleak, management is optimistic about the outlook 12 to 18 months from now. The main reason: lots of new LNG export capacity is expected to come online toward the end of the year into early 2025. This coupled with the possibility of cold weather gives the team hope for a price recovery. Coterra plans to keep a watchful eye on the commodities market and will be ready to act when gas fundamentals improve. But in the interim, it plans to stay disciplined. After all, it is hard to predict how long downswings in commodity cycles will last. ""We will be patient and watch for recovery in the gas macro,"" CEO Tom Jorden explained. He added the company would rather wait a few months for a recovery before investing too early. We appreciate this focus on returns instead of chasing production and activity. Club earnings: Two companies in the portfolio are scheduled to report next week. Both are out Wednesday: off-price retailer TJX Companies before the opening bell and enterprise software giant Salesforce after the closing bell. Outside the portfolio, some of the more interesting earnings reports will come from Elanco Animal Health , Unity , Zoom , Lowe's , American Electric Powe r, Cava , Snowflake , Paramount Global , Best Buy and Zscaler . Economic calendar: the data point likely have the most influence on the bond market is the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge: the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index.

The Quencher H2.0 FlowState Tumbler, which has become iconic in recent years thanks to a concerted effort to rebrand it for a female audience rather than Stanley's historically male customer base, has had multiple high-profile collabs in recent months, including with country music star Lainey Wilson.

The newest offering — a pink Stanley featuring the Starbucks logo on the side — has become a social media sensation, with fans rushing into Target as soon as the doors opened to get their hands on one.

The Starbucks collab, as well as a Valentines Day collection featuring a red Quencher and a pink Quencher, were so popular that Target limited customers to two per person.

Indeed, demand for the cups is so high that the only way to get one now is on the resale market, and resellers are trying to take advantage.

521,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/19/cramer-the-feds-rate-hikes-did-little-to-slow-our-robust-economy.html,SYY,Sysco,Let's accept it: The Fed's rate hikes did little to slow this roaring economy,"Can't stop won't stop? OK, you will never confuse me for a rapper, but those are the four words that describe this economy right now. And as we walk into retail earnings hell — a period where too many retailers report all at once and the comparisons become odiously confusing, starting with Walmart and Home Depot before the bell on Tuesday — I have to marvel that there is no discernible let-up in spending across most areas. There are a couple of ways to measure things. First, we can just look at some of the companies that reported late this past week: Applied Materials, DraftKings, DoorDash, Toast, and The Trade Desk. Second, we can examine the cacophony of 52-week highs that stick out like a dazzling neon shouting ""Gangbusters."" So let's do both. Let's start with Toast , a remarkable company with a client roster of 106,000 restaurants, up 34% from a year ago, almost all providing annual recurring revenue. The cloud-based restaurant management software company is going after the big chains, like Caribou Coffee, and winning. It is also winning small- and medium-sized businesses — perhaps more than 30% of that market, although having been in this business I have no idea how that share is calculated. I have not been a fan of this company because of its losses and its inability to pivot to profit. Restaurants can also switch to a competitor pretty easily. But the company announced on Thursday that it will lay off 10% of its workforce, so the pivot is now here. Most surprising, however, is the strength of restaurant formation right now, which makes the ascent of Toast so obvious. When an economy is in full-blown retreat, this is a segment that gets decked. Now it's easy to get a read-through when you consider the earnings progression of companies that support restaurants like Ecolab , Cintas , and Sysco (Cintas CEO Todd Schneider joined me on ""Mad Money"" in late December, while Sysco CEO Kevin Hourican was on in late January). Their results can tell you how much growth there has been across a vast panoply of operations. But Toast is discretionary, and therefore a sight to be seen. I know people panned the DoorDash quarter, but from the point of view of revenues (27% growth) and not profits it shows me that people are willing to spend even more money to not go out. You have to add the DoorDash numbers to the Toast numbers to see the strength of the go-out and go-in parts of the economy. The numbers are so daunting that it's hard to see them slowing down. The Trade Desk plies its technology in the trillion-dollar ad market and its 23% sales growth in the fourth quarter demonstrates that companies are accelerating their marketing spend, something that they almost always cut back on if they are hurting. As a result, The Trade Desk can be viewed as both a barometer of e-commerce and the temperature of connected TV, which can only be described as boiling. It's not easy to read into the 64% growth in revenue from DraftKings as there are always fresh states and fresh markets for online gambling. Suffice it to say that gambling may be the most excessive spending imaginable unless, of course, you bet against the Philadelphia Eagles for the last six games of this NFL season — a painful annuity stream. Perhaps the most absurdly positive numbers came from Applied Materials , which makes the machines that make DRAM and NAND flash chips used for tons of devices not necessary if you are cutting back. The company's better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results and strong second-quarter numbers signal that the inventory glut that came from excess personal computers and other Best Buy kinds of consumer tech items is now history. Talk about things you do not need. When I say not need, I am not saying that we have become profligate, although with ""buy now, pay later"" we have discovered a hidden sense of profligacy. I am just saying that the Federal Reserve does not have a handle on how overheated this economy has become. A random walk down the new 52-week-high list confirms this, with 53 stocks in the S & P 500 hitting that milestone on Friday alone. That included Simon Property Group , the national mall company with barely any vacancies and at full-price leases, and Ralph Lauren , which jumped 30 points on an earnings surprise. That was some quarter from Ralph, but in truth so were the last two quarters — this one was just better received on the Street. Costco hit a new high last week, too: That's been the juggernaut in retail the whole way. As did Walmart. There aren't a lot of individual retailers on the new high list. We may see Rite Aid in bankruptcy. We may wonder about the liquidity of Big Lots . But neither of these chains is in a Simon Property indoor mall, where the occupancy rate is 96%-98%. But Children's Place ? It was in trouble for about a day and then Reuters reported that a Saudi family scooped in and bought 54% and that was that. The financing is now there. It wouldn't be if we were at the murderous portion of a tightening cycle. New fintech is flagging, but old fintech is zooming. We can tell this from the incredible performances of Mastercard and American Express , the latter finally silencing all doubters with its multiple-year double-digit projections. The credit card company was always capable of making those rosy forecasts but had been reluctant to do so. The fact that it did now says it all. Remember the drivers of American Express were two-fold: solvency and spending, with the latter heavily geared to dining out. Travel was almost as strong. In case you thought that Applied Materials was alone, KLA and Lam Research once again hit new highs. You need these companies for all sorts of semiconductor chips and Lam has some very good technology that goes with Nvidia's supercomputer. That group seems unstoppable. Waste Management makes the list and people may not realize this, but the biggest source of waste comes from construction, particularly home construction. The company had an excellent quarter, which means people believe we are still going to be in growth mode for new planned unit developments. We have so many scaremongers out there when it comes to commercial real estate — I keep thinking of the imprudent comments by Starwood Capital Group CEO Barry Sternlicht about $1 trillion of losses on office properties — but then how in the heck is the stock of elevator company Otis on the list. Sure, a big part of the company's business is service. There's also a China component. However, we already know that China's construction has crashed. Instead, it's a sign that smaller buildings may be using Otis. The fact is that buildings are being built, and while commercial real estate may be a danger zone, it's not for lack of demand, it may be for lack of useable supply. Meanwhile, just in case you were concerned that the trillions of dollars earmarked by the U.S. government for infrastructure are running out, you see Eaton , Emerson , Dover , Cummins, and the ubiquitous Parker-Hannifin all made new highs last week too. Over the many years working in this business, I was schooled and taught to trust the aggregate data. Here's what I learned: following the aggregate data is like being a fan. Studying the actual numbers is what a professional can do. All of the new companies make being a pro harder, so you have to work even more — even when it's a drag to monitor Toast sign-ups, Uber rides, or DoorDash deliveries. When you look at the mosaic from the bottom up, it shows that we have an economy that has not been dented by higher interest rates. That's not because auto sales haven't slowed down. They have. It's not because housing hasn't slowed down. It has. It's not because spending on goods hasn't slowed down. It has. But nothing has slowed down enough to make a difference when it comes to inflation. A home price plus a mortgage is about where it's been the whole time. Dining out, traveling, hotels — none of it has come down and some prices are still going up. Very few salaries have kept up with inflation and now we have anywhere from eight to ten million immigrants that are either part of the labor force or receiving government assistance. The former keeps wages down and the latter keeps inflation up, as housed immigrants drive up rent rates, which are in the consumer price index. So let's just cut to the chase. There is only one way to keep inflation lower and that's through layoffs. There are all sorts of stories about tech layoffs. Those are almost all one-off though and you aren't going to see those people on breadlines. We know that there have been some fintech layoffs but amazingly we have not seen large-scale shutdowns. Private companies that want to go public will be able to or will be kept on life support until they can. It's why I like Morgan Stanley now as much as I like Wells Fargo , if not more. Morgan Stanley stands to gain once the IPO market picks up. Still, so many people delude themselves into thinking about a June rate cut, as they once believed there would be a cut in March or May. I have been adamant that this economy isn't too strong, but it also isn't slowing. And if slowing is what it takes to bring rate cuts, then you know the only thing that will slow it is higher, if not much higher, unemployment. The obvious issue is the lack of any sort of rigor or even homework to justify why rate cuts should occur. What would they do other than cause inflation to flood right back in? I sure wish that the Fed had never made its statement it was done raising rates for now — even though it precipitated one heck of a rally. For now a simple ""let's wait and see"" from the central bank without mentioning cuts this year would be a better state of play than the current one. Hanging on every cutting word from the Fed is a noose for this market. I will change my mind when a company like Children's Place has no suitors and the lots of homes are empty. Until then we have to accept that the reason why earnings season has been so bountiful is that we have an amazingly robust — not just resilient — economy and rate hikes have done next to nothing to change things.

General Motors — Shares of General Motors rose 7.8% after the automaker topped Wall Street's estimates on the top and bottom lines and offered strong guidance for 2024. The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share on $42.98 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023. United Parcel Service — The package delivery company slumped 8.2% after UPS reported disappointing fourth-quarter revenue and guidance. Revenue of $24.92 billion was lower than the $25.43 billion consensus estimate from analysts polled by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv. UPS issued full-year revenue guidance between $92 billion and $94.5 billion, which was below the $95.57 billion anticipated by Wall Street. Bank of America , Citigroup — Shares rose after Morgan Stanley upgraded several large banks , saying the future is ""bright"" for the sector. Bank of America shares gained 3.5% following an upgrade to overweight from equal weight. Citigroup shares jumped 5.5% after an upgrade to overweight from underweight. JetBlue Airways — Shares of the airline fell 4.7% after JetBlue reported that it swung to a loss during the fourth quarter. The company said its capacity will decline in 2024 as it tries to return to profitability. Marathon Petroleum — Shares jumped 6%, hitting a new 52-week high after the company reported a beat on the top and bottom lines. Marathon Petroleum posted adjusted earnings of $3.98 per share on $36.82 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by FactSet had forecast earnings of $2.21 per share on revenue of $34.90 billion. While the company's operating income also beat analysts' estimates, it declined on a year-over-year basis. Whirlpool — Shares tumbled 6.6% on the back of weak full-year guidance. Late Monday, the home appliance maker said to expect adjusted earnings in a range between $13 and $15 per share on revenue of $16.9 billion. But analysts polled by LSEG forecast $15.48 per share and revenue of $17.7 billion. That distracted from a better-than-expected fourth-quarter report. Sanmina — Sanmina shares soared 28.2% after the manufacturing services provider reported better-than-expected earnings for the first fiscal quarter, as well as second-quarter guidance that topped estimates. On Monday, Sanmina reported adjusted earnings of $1.30 per share, more than analysts' estimates for earnings of $1.15 per share, according to FactSet. Revenue of $1.87 billion was in line with expectations. MSCI — MSCI shares jumped 9.3% after the finance company reported fourth-quarter results that exceeded expectations. MSCI posted adjusted earnings of $3.68 per share on revenue of $690.1 million. Analysts polled by FactSet were anticipating earnings of $3.29 per share on revenue of $662.6 million. Corning — Corning shares jumped 6.9% after the materials science company behind specialty glass and ceramics posted fourth-quarter core revenue that came in better than anticipated. Core revenue came in at $3.27 billion, more than the $3.26 billion anticipated by analysts polled by FactSet. Core earnings per share of 39 cents was in line with expectations. Management also said it expects the first quarter will be the low quarter of the year. Nucor — Shares of the steel manufacturer rose 6.9%. On Monday, the company posted earnings of $3.16 per share for the fourth quarter, which beat analysts' estimates by 29 cents per share, according to LSEG. Nucor also said it expects first-quarter earnings this year to increase and that the resilience of the U.S. economy as well as steel-intensive megatrends are driving demand for its products. Super Micro Computer — Super Micro Computer gained 3.5% after its fiscal second-quarter results exceeded expectations. Late Monday, the information technology company posted adjusted earnings of $5.59 per share on $3.66 billion of revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG expected earnings of $4.93 per share on $3.06 billion of revenue. Sysco — Sysco shares popped 7.5% after the wholesale restaurant distributor posted better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings. Adjusted earnings of 89 cents per share beat analysts' expectations for earnings of 88 cents per share, per FactSet. However, revenue of $19.29 billion was lower than the consensus estimate of $19.32 billion. A.O. Smith — The water heater manufacturer dropped nearly 2%. A.O. Smith issued full-year guidance, with the lower end of its forecast coming in below analysts' estimates, per FactSet. The company anticipates adjusted earnings for 2024 of $3.90 to $4.15 per share, while analysts called for $4.05 per share. Projected revenue for the period is ranging between $3.97 billion and $4.05 billion, compared to the Street's estimates for $3.99 billion. — CNBC's Alex Harring, Hakyung Kim, Tanaya Macheel, Jesse Pound and Samantha Subin contributed reporting.",1/30/2024,2,0.888208985,0.053339038,0.00261999,0.02135003,0.03147798,0.003004005

Here's what we want to see from each,"All three major averages posted gains for the third consecutive week, lifted by solid quarterly earnings and positive economic data. Gross domestic product data for the fourth quarter came in hotter than expected on Thursday at the headline level, but didn't little to pull down stocks thanks to softer price data. One day later, December's core personal consumption expenditures price (core PCE) index landed in line with Wall Street's expectations. In other words, the economy is growing faster than expected even as the rate of inflation continues to come down. In addition, December new home sales came in better than expected, as did December pending home sales . Within the portfolio, Procter & Gamble shares popped more than 4% on Tuesday after reporting strong quarterly results . Sales just missed estimates but profitability was solid, excluding charges related to writing down the value of Gillette and non-core restructuring measures. As a result, management was able to raise the low end of its full-year earnings forecast. Earnings season ramps up next week, with five of the Super Six mega-cap stocks delivering results. Given their weightings in the market, these releases will drive the market, for better or worse. Here's what we're keeping an eye on: 1. Jobs, jobs, jobs. Employment numbers are the most important economic data, with Friday's January nonfarm payrolls report carrying the most weight. Wall Street expects a headline reading of 178,000 jobs added. Arguably more important, however, is wage inflation data that's tucked into the report. Consumer buying power allows companies to raise prices while protecting volumes. To that end, higher wage growth equals more buying power — supports prolonged inflation. Therefore, a hot wage number hear could spook the market. As of Friday, economists expect 4.1%, which is in line with December's rate. That would still outpaces recent inflation data — core PCE price index, the Fed's preferred measure came in at 2.9% for December. If that holds, the consumer could recoup some of the buying power lost in recent years. The ADP employment report on Wednesday will give investors a bit of a read-through to Friday (though far from accurate), while the job openings and labor turnover s urvey (JOLTS) job on Tuesday will signal how tight the labor market is by analyzing the number of job openings, rate of hiring, and the rate of workers leaving their jobs. 2. Manufacturing update. The January ISM Manufacturing report on Thursday and December's factory orders report Friday are expected to show the sector still in contraction mode. Analysts are forecasting a 47.3% reading on ISM manufacturing, which measures the rate of contraction or expansion. The further below 50, the faster the contraction; the further above 50, the faster the rate of expansion. 3. Earnings. It's a big week for the portfolio with 10 companies set to report. Danaher : Management already preannounced positive results at the JPM Healthcare Conference earlier this month, but was conservative about when it expects the bioprocessing orders to pick back up. But earnings and commentary this week from peer Sartorious made us encouraged about a return to growth in 2024. Alphabet : We are looking for confirmation that the advertising market is in recovery mode and want to hear that the search giant's AI investments are helping to improve customer ROIs. Cloud will also be a key watch item as the results last time were sub-optimal, especially against what we heard from Amazon and Microsoft. This release should give us some insight into whether that was a fluke or if maybe Alphabet just can't compete with Azure and AWS. 2024 is also supposed to be the year in which cost savings and efficiency efforts really start to kick in so we want to hear what the team has to say about increased operating leverage. Finally, we'd like an update from management on how AI is improving search and helping to maintain market share, as well as any more detail on Gemini, its new multimodal AI model. Microsoft : It's all about Azure growth and AI monetization. On cloud unit Azure, we're looking for growth in the 27% to 28% range on an annual basis (26% to 27% on a constant currency basis) as enterprise spend optimization efforts wind down and budgets begin to rebound. As for AI, commentary on its Copilot feature is key as its the quickest way for the company to monetize on their massive investments in OpenAI and generative AI more broadly. Given the need for investments and uncertainty about how big will become, the Street will also look for expense guidance. We want them to invest in future growth, but management needs to ensure investors that they will be disciplined in their approach. Starbucks : We expect coffee chain will miss on sales due to a weaker China market than expected, Middle East boycotts, and a slowdown in the United States. The question is how big of a reset it will be and does the stock in the low $90s reflect these lower numbers? Some analysts argue yes, others say no. We've been waiting for this quarterly report to guide our next moves. Honeywell : Aerospace should remain strong. The bigger question is about its short-cycle markets, like in safety and productivity solutions where sales have been falling but orders looked to be finally turning a corner last quarter. We'd like an update on its M & A strategy after the company announced it will acquire Carrier's Global Access Solutions business. We thought it was a good pickup. Eaton : When this industrial announced the resignation of its CFO last week, it said it expects strong results for the fourth quarter. We'll see what the numbers show. Our focus will be on the ongoing momentum in orders for its electrical business. Stanley Black & Decker : The toolmaker will guide 2024 earnings somewhere in the $4 to $5 range as gross margins continue to recover. Watching progress on inventory reduction, reducing other costs. We're also prepared to hear that DIY demand remains soft. Apple : We're not expecting anything crazy from the reported numbers. As usual, we'll focus on services growth as this is key to further margin expansion, and would love to hear about a new record high on the installed base. The Street is expecting services will be up 12.3% from a year ago, but a decline of 2% for product sales. It's what management says outside of the reported results, however, that will move the stock. The big topic likely to come up during the Q & A is how management is addressing the recent regulatory ruling in Europe that is forcing them to open the iOS platform to other non-Apple app stores. We also expect we'll hear questions about Apple Watch demand following the removal of a blood oxygen monitoring feature on certain models to comply with a recent ruling in its battle against Masimo . Lastly, on a more positive note, we're excited to hear anything new about Vision Pro demand and perhaps any unique ways developers are looking to leverage the new ""spatial computing"" technology. Amazon : As usual, we expect AWS cloud growth and management's forward operating income guidance to be the key drivers of the stock action. We'd also like to see strong advertising growth as we think the company has a major opportunity to gain market share here, especially as they open the Prime Video platform to allow for more ads. For e-commerce, we're looking for a continued rebound in operating leverage as capacity utilization improves. Meta Platforms : We expect to see some stock action ahead of Meta's release based on Alphabet's commentary on the ad market. Specific to Meta, however, we want to hear about how AI investments are helping with user engagement, and improving targeting and ROI for ad buyers. Reels monetization is also a key focus. Last quarter, management said Reels was net neutral to overall ad revenue after a period of being a drag, as is usually the case with new mediums unfamiliar to ad buyers.

GameStop said on Tuesday it had cut an unspecified number of jobs to reduce costs and reported lower fourth-quarter revenue amid rising competition from e-commerce firms and weak consumer spending in an uncertain economy.

Shares of the Grapevine, Texas-based company tumbled 17% in extended trade after the results.

Soft consumer spending has weighed on the gaming market over the past few months, with U.S. videogame publishers Take-Two Interactive Software and Electronic Arts reporting earnings below estimates last month.

FAQs Do all banks charge for savings accounts? Not all banks have savings accounts with fees attached to them. You can easily find a savings account that doesn't charge you. When shopping around, make sure to read the terms and conditions and small print so you know before signing up. Some bank accounts have ways you can get around fees, too, like waiving a monthly service charge if you opt into paperless statements. Can I open a free savings account? You can certainly open a free savings account — and this list is a good place to start. Most savings accounts take not even 10 minutes to apply and just require a government-issued ID like a passport or driver's license, Social Security number, address, contact information, date of birth and a checking account routing number to deposit money. Can I get a high yield with a free savings account? Some free savings accounts offer higher yields than others, but all at least on this list are above the national savings average. If your priority is maximizing your savings, however, check out CNBC Select's list of interest savings accounts offering around 5% APY. Sometimes, the higher interest-bearing savings accounts require minimums. Are free savings accounts FDIC-insured? There are plenty of savings accounts — free or not — that are FDIC-insured, so don't settle for one that isn't and check to make sure your bank offers FDIC coverage. (All of the savings accounts on this list have FDIC insurance coverage.) Though the FDIC protects up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank for each type of account ownership category, some financial institutions have been increasing the amount savers can insure in a single account by spreading customer deposits across multiple FDIC-insured banks. Can I get ATM access with a free savings account? Few savings accounts — let alone free ones — offer ATM access. While you usually have to open a checking account to get ATM access, the Synchrony Bank High Yield Savings offers savers an ATM card so they can easily access their cash at any ATM displaying the Plus or Accel logos. Synchrony Bank currently doesn't charge a fee to use an ATM, but the ATM owner/operator may. For these domestic ATM fees charged by other financial institutions, Synchrony will refund up to $5 per statement cycle.

Why trust CNBC Select?

At CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money. Every savings review is based on rigorous reporting by our team of expert writers and editors with extensive knowledge of banking products. While CNBC Select earns a commission from affiliate partners on many offers and links, we create all our content without input from our commercial team or any outside third parties, and we pride ourselves on our journalistic standards and ethics.

Our methodology

To determine which savings accounts made this list, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. savings accounts offered by online and brick-and-mortar banks, including large credit unions. We narrowed down our picks by only considering those savings accounts with above-average rates that offer no fees whatsoever, including zero: Monthly maintenance fees

Excessive transactions fees

Overdraft fees

Insufficient / non-sufficient funds fees Note that we did not consider wire fees since we found that most banks charge a wire fee for outgoing transfers. We then narrowed down our picks even further by only highlighting those savings accounts that currently do not require any minimum deposits to open an account or minimum balances to earn interest. Although the accounts on this list don't require you to reach certain minimums, the respective banks may close your account if it remains unfunded for a while. All of the accounts included on this list are FDIC-insured up to $250,000 per depositor, some even more. Note that the rates and fee structures for savings accounts are not guaranteed forever; they are subject to change without notice and they often fluctuate in accordance with the Fed rate. Your earnings depend on any associated fees and the balance you have in your savings account. To open an account, most banks and institutions require a deposit of new money, meaning you can't transfer the money you already had in an account at that bank.

528,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/08/tesla-settles-wrongful-death-lawsuit-over-fatal-2018-autopilot-crash.html,TSLA,"Tesla, Inc.",Tesla settles lawsuit over Autopilot crash that killed Apple engineer,"A Tesla Model X burns after crashing on U.S. Highway 101 in Mountain View, California, U.S. on March 23, 2018.

Tesla has settled a wrongful death lawsuit brought by the family of Walter Huang, an Apple engineer and father of two who died after his Model X SUV, with Autopilot features switched on, crashed into a highway barrier near Mountain View, California, in 2018.

The settlement comes as jury selection and a trial were just beginning on Monday in a California Superior court. The settlement allows Tesla to avoid airing evidence and testimonies in a widely-followed case.

The National Transportation Safety Board investigated the fatal crash and revealed, in 2020, that it found Tesla's tech was at least partly to blame for the collision, along with possible driver distraction and problematic road construction. NTSB believed that Huang had been looking at a game on his phone at some point before the collision.

The federal agency found that Tesla's forward collision warning system did not provide an alert, and its automatic emergency braking system did not activate as Huang's Model X, with Autopilot engaged, accelerated into a barrier alongside the highway 101. Faded lane markings and the barrier — or crash attenuator — positioning also may have contributed to the collision, the NTSB said in 2020.

Huang's bereaved family sued Tesla for wrongful death and their claims focused in part on alleged safety and design defects in the company's driver assistance systems. The case was Sz Huang et al v. Tesla Inc. et al in a California Superior Court in Santa Clara County.

Huang attorneys, in court filings, also pointed to social media and marketing messages from Tesla, its CEO Elon Musk and others, suggesting that Autopilot made Tesla vehicles safe to drive without needing to stay attentive to the road at all times or without needing to keep hands on the vehicle's steering wheel.

In internal Tesla e-mails referenced in court filings, Tesla execs and engineers discussed how they had become complacent while driving their Tesla vehicles with Autopilot or related premium features switched on. They described reading emails and checking their phones while driving with these systems engaged.",4/8/2024,2,0.073876143,0.02668527,0.002428428,0.7237975,0.170648813,0.002563944

Please refresh every 20-30 minutes to view the latest posts.) Nvidia and a major electric vehicle maker were in focus as part of Wednesday's analyst chatter. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Nvidia, calling for more than 15% upside going forward. Jefferies, meanwhile, cut it 12-month forecast on Tesla. Check out the latest calls and chatter below. All times ET. 8:15 a.m.: Morgan Stanley raises price target on GM, says it could benefit from EV slowdown Morgan Stanley raised its price target on GM to $46 from $43 and said that the current slowdown in EVs could be positive for the auto maker. It has an overweight rating on the shares. Analyst Adam Jonas said a doubling of its full-year restructuring/impairment charges to $3 billion, related to electric and autonomous vehicles should ""lower the bar on big investments in EVs that will not deliver on expected volume."" The firm also trimmed its capex estimates to the low end of GM's guidance and raised its earnings estimates by 9%. He also noted that although GM has acknowledged the momentum in hybrids, it ""virtually gave up on hybrids in its push towards pure [battery electric vehicle] architectures,"" and ""may have to spool up investment in hybrids from here."" GM shares were little changed in premarket trading. –Tanaya Macheel 8:14 a.m.: Block shares could rally more than 30%, Mizuho says Mizuho sees more upside in store for shares of Block . Analysts Dan Dolev lifted the firm's price target to $106 from $99, citing the potential for gross profit to exceed 20% in 2024. The updated target implies about 33% upside from Tuesday's close. ""Reinvigorated management focus on Cash App and Square ecosystems could potentially drive meaningful upside to 2024 guide,"" he wrote. ""Management guided to 15%+ gross profit growth, but we see potential for > 20%."" Underpinning this upside potential is a bet that the company can convert 1 million cash card users to direct deposit and reach higher-income customers. Other critical components include the expansion of the company's Cash App borrow product and a recovery in point-of-sale momentum within the U.S. restaurant industry. ""We are raising our estimates to reflect more optimism around SQ's gross profit potential,"" he wrote, and ahead of the 15% guide and 16% consensus estimate. – Samantha Subin 7:44 a.m.: Truist downgrades Deckers to hold It's time to step to the sidelines on footwear company Deckers Outdoor , according to Truist. Analyst Joseph Civello downgraded Deckers to hold from buy, and lowered his price target, citing card data showing softening demand for the footwear company's popular Hoka brand. On the other hand, the analyst noted trends for UGG shoes remain strong. ""Truist Card Data indicates that HOKA's Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) growth decelerated in mid-Feb and remained softer through March. We lowered our segment growth forecast from ~40%E (where the Street currently is) to 25%E,"" Civello wrote. ""Truist Card Data for UGG looks very strong and we are raising ests for the segment."" To be sure, the analyst said he remains optimistic over Hoka's long-term potential, but noted the risk/reward for the stock ""looks balanced"" from here after its outperformance. The stock is up about 30% this year. The analyst's $864 price target, lowered from $983, is just slightly lower from Tuesday's closing price of $867.81. Shares fell 2% in premarket trading. — Sarah Min 7:42 a.m.: Goldman Sachs initiates Alcon at a buy rating, sees 21% upside ahead An attractive valuation and strong growth drivers make Alcon a good investment, according to Goldman Sachs. The bank initiated shares of the contact lens solutions maker at a buy rating. Analyst Richard Felton also set a price target of $100, which corresponds to a 21% rally for the stock. Shares of Alcon are up nearly 6% this year. ""We believe current valuation represents an attractive entry point ahead of potential upgrades and an FCF inflection,"" Felton wrote. The analyst added that additional gains are supported by attractive growth across multiple sectors. ""Alcon's core businesses are delivering solid growth, supported by what we see as strong market positions and attractive end markets. We also see multiple opportunities to drive incremental growth,"" he said. Specifically, Felton highlighted volume-based procurement in the Chinese market as one driver of incremental growth. This could increase both Alcon's procedure volume and current market share. Another factor that has yet to be fully reflected in consensus estimates is the potential for further share gains in Alcon's contact lenses market. ""Looking ahead, we see scope for further share gains in Dailies and see upside in reusable lenses, where Alcon's share is relatively underweight,"" Felton said. Finally, an opportunity also exists within the dry eye category, with Felton predicting a strong growth runway for Alcon's artificial tears brand, as it increases its penetration in the market. — Lisa Kailai Han 7:28 a.m.: Bank of America upgrades Albemarle to buy on the back of increasing lithium prices Improving lithium prices will lift up shares of Albemarle , according to Bank of America. Bank of America analyst Steve Byrne upgraded shares of the chemical manufacturer to a buy rating from neutral. He accompanied the move by lifting the stock's price target to $156 from $137. This updated forecast implies that shares could rise 21%. Albemarle stock is down 11% for the year. One major catalyst that could drive the stock upwards is the improvement in market fundamentals as the prices of lithium rise from here. ""Given recent pricing improvement in spodumene and lithium salts, we believe it is likely to see a near-term reduction in lithium inventory levels in China, which would reinforce the upward move in lithium chemical pricing,"" Byrne wrote. ""We have raised our global lithium chemical and spodumene concentrate price expectations."" He added that improving lithium prices would also drive Albemarle's near-term and future earnings. — Lisa Kailai Han 7:01 a.m.: Citi upgrades International Flavors & Fragrance to a buy rating International Flavors & Fragrance could rise as the firm re-centers its focus around a new CEO, according to Citi. The bank upgraded shares of the food, beverage and scent manufacturer to a buy rating from neutral. Citi also lifted its price target for the company to $100 from $81, implying that shares could rally nearly 16% from their current price. ""Most of the news flow is behind IFF (dividend cut, Pharma business sale), and we see a compelling pathway towards volume recovery and deleveraging, which should drive performance for shares,"" wrote analyst Patrick Cunningham. The analyst underscored new CEO Erik Fyrwald's focus on sales execution and balance sheet management. Management has also proven its commitment and ability to strengthen the capital structure by reducing debt, the analyst remarked. As another catalyst, he cited the company's potential carry over of 2023's improved volume levels. ""The cadence of volume improvements will likely carry through to FY24, with sequential volume growth in Health & Biosciences and Scent in 1H24, based on comments in 4Q23 earnings,"" Cunningham wrote. ""We think the prospects for volume recovery in the industry will be driven by improving prospects for consumer goods companies with some upside potential from restocking."" Shares of International Flavors & Fragrance are up nearly 7% this year. — Lisa Kailai Han 6:44 a.m.: Jefferies names Zillow a top pick Jefferies sees a ""one in a Zillow opportunity"" when it comes to Zillow . The investment firm named Zillow as its new top pick, a designation that was previously rewarded to DoorDash. While shares of the real estate marketplace have already slid 17% this year, Jefferies' price target of $75 means there could be more than 56% upside potential for the stock. Zillow stock has tumbled recently since the National Association of Realtors announced a settlement to potentially lower real estate commission rates on March 15. But Jefferies believes that investors have overestimated the potential drawbacks of the settlement. ""As long as buyer agents can see the commission split for a given listing before presenting a buyer, we believe sellers will remain incentivized to offer compensation,"" wrote analyst John Colantuoni. ""The pullback in Z's stock following NAR's proposed settlement creates a more attractive entry point given we expect no impact on fundamentals."" Additionally, Colantuoni also believes that Zillow's plans to expand its products and services could lead to revenue upside. Low variable costs should help drive these margins up even higher, increasing Zillow's overall profit-taking. — Lisa Kailai Han 6:26 a.m.: KeyBanc upgrades GoodRx to overweight, sees room for subscription growth KeyBanc Capital Markets sees an increasing subscriber base propelling GoodRx's stock in the future. The firm upgraded shares of the telemedicine company to overweight from sector weight. The bank also lifted its price target to $9, implying shares could rally 34% from Tuesday's close. ""We are upgrading shares of GDRX to Overweight as we get more constructive for this re-accelerating high-growth, high-margin company trading at a discount to peers and historical average given positive recent data trends,"" wrote analyst Scott Schoenhaus. Besides increased estimates, Schoenhaus also listed increased app downloads and monthly active customers as additional catalysts. Downloads of the GoodRx app accelerated in February and have proved to hold up in March as well, despite a more challenging backdrop. Additionally, the analyst noted a 2% increase in GoodRx's gold subscription customers from February to March. With the new Publix membership rollout unveiling GoodRx's gold membership across 1,200 locations, even more unique customers could be subscribed to the program going forward. ""Our favorite names into 1Q earnings are CERT, GDRX, PHR, and SDGR, where we see the biggest opportunities for beat-and-raises this quarter and throughout the year, and we support our thesis with data in the following pages."" GoodRX shares have struggled this year, rising less than 1%. GDRX YTD mountain GDRX in 2024 — Lisa Kailai Han 6 a.m.: Barclays views Chevron stock as attractive both with or without Hess deal Barclays sees a bright future ahead for Chevron . The bank initiated coverage of the oil and gas giant at overweight, setting a price target of $203. This implies that Chevron could soar another 25%. Year to date, the stock is up 9%. Analyst Betty Jiang thinks Chevron looks attractive, both with or without its potential acquisition of fellow energy company Hess . ""After a period of challenging mega-project developments over the last decade, CVX is finally shifting into a development that's lower capital intensity, lower execution risk, and more flexible short-cycle production,"" she wrote. Meanwhile, Chevron has also managed to finetune a balanced portfolio, consisting of both long- and short-cycle assets, which helps mitigate potential base production decline, Jiang said. Additionally, she sees Chevron's potential cash return of over 10% post-Hess deal as another catalyst. ""We believe CVX offers outsized cash return (second highest in our coverage universe), free cash flow inflection from start-up of the TCO expansion, and a high return legacy position in the Permian,"" she added. As an added bonus, Chevron is also actively contributing to the renewable energy transition. Jiang also viewed possible upcoming asset sales as another catalyst for the energy firm. — Lisa Kailai Han 5:53 a.m.: Jefferies lowers Tesla price target, cites 'self-inflicted' wounds Tesla's troubles may not be over yet, according to Jefferies. The investment firm kept its hold rating on the electric vehicle maker and lowered its price target to $165 from $185. The new forecast implies shares could slide nearly 7% from Tuesday's close. Tesla has already had a tough year, weighed down by waning sales in China and slowing demand for electric vehicles. The stock has lost nearly 29% in 2024, making it one of the worst performers in the S & P 500. Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois also said Tesla is plagued by shifting product priorities. He cited reports of production of the company's low-cost Model 2 being canceled . ""Most issues affecting core auto performance appear self-inflicted and should keep returns well below potential for the coming 24 months,"" he wrote. — Lisa Kailai Han 5:53 a.m.: Morgan Stanley raises Nvidia price target Nvidia has already rallied more than 72% in 2024. Morgan Stanley sees even more gains ahead. Analyst Joseph Moore raised his price target on the artificial intelligence darling to $1,000 per share from $795. The new forecast points to 17% upside from Tuesday's close. ""Preferring NVIDIA seems unimaginative, as it was the best performing stock last year ... and it has risen to market caps that we would have thought of as unfathomable a few quarters ago,"" Moore wrote. ""That said, the peers have not been undiscovered either, with stocks with direct exposure to these markets, such as AMD and MRVL, having risen to new multiple highs."" NVDA YTD mountain NVDA year to date The analyst highlighted several factors in favor of Nvidia, including strong pricing and robust orders for its semiconductors. ""We expect NVDA's Data Center business to drive much of the growth over the next 5 years, as enthusiasm for generative AI has created a strong environment for AI/ML hardware solutions - NVDA's being one of the most important,"" Moore wrote. — Fred Imbert",4/10/2024,-1,0.02231613,0.680550933,0.002691221,0.244023174,0.047503561,0.002914944
530,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/07/tesla-has-tanked-34percent-this-year-some-investors-doubt-a-recovery-.html,TSLA,"Tesla, Inc.",Tesla shares have tanked 34% this year. Investors raise doubts over whether the EV maker will return to form,"Tesla 's lost its way. The dominant U.S. manufacturer of electric vehicles once praised as an auto industry innovator has come under mounting pressure in recent months, grappling with growing China competition and waning demand, forcing the Elon Musk-led company to cut prices to lift sales. The issues have rattled investors, dragging down shares by 34% since the start of 2024 and ushering in concerns about Tesla's health and growth potential. The latest U-turn is a sharp reversal after Tesla had soared to a peak market value surpassing $1.2 trillion. Today it's worth about $525 billion. TSLA YTD mountain Tesla shares in 2024 Even the bulls have grown worried, with Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas admitting last week that Tesla's woes could temporarily drive the stock as low as $100 — his worst case scenario. Wedbush's Dan Ives called a first-quarter slump in deliveries an ""unmitigated disaster."" Wall Street is a lot less optimistic than it was. The number of analysts holding a buy-equivalent rating on Tesla is down to just 33%, versus 53% at the end of March 2023, according to FactSet. ""We view this as a seminal moment in the Tesla story for Musk to either turn this around and reverse the black eye 1Q performance,"" Ives said in a note to clients. ""Otherwise, some darker days could clearly be ahead that could disrupt the long-term Tesla narrative,"" Ives continued. While some investors expect emerging themes such as artificial intelligence, a robotaxi project or autopilot involving full self-driving cars to boost Tesla's long-term growth, even those betting on the stock are braced for a long, bumpy road to recovery. Disappointing investors Tesla's inability to meet estimates and boost demand for its models has spurrred the newfound skepticism. The stock dove 12% one day in January after missing analysts' fourth-quarter estimates and warning of slow growth. It dropped more than 6% last week after reporting those disappointing first-quarter deliveries. ""The market's not loving stocks right now that can't beat earnings,"" said Michael Sansoterra, chief investment officer at Silvant Capital Management. ""Unfortunately, [Tesla's] life cycle in this particular moment, and what the market is willing to pay for, are at odds."" He attributed Tesla's recent quarterly shortfalls to deteriorating profit margins owing to price cuts used to stir demand. CapWealth chief investment officer Tim Pagliara thinks investors and Wall Street baked in ""unrealistic expectations"" into Tesla's valuation, with a far higher multiple than incumbent manufacturers such as General Motors, Ford and Toyota. To be sure, Tesla isn't alone in its recent distress as enthusiasm for EVs has waned, partly due to a newfound love affair with hybrid vehicles instead. The EV market has suffered in recent months as companies such as Ford have been forced to rethink plans , citing the industry's higher costs relative to internal combustion engine vehicles. The industry's also been stalled by the need for hefty investments in infrastructure, such as charging stations, and technological advancements in battery storage, size and capacity, Sansoterra explained. ""It's not done, it's not mature,"" the Silvant Capital manager said. ""It's still a growing industry that's got a ways to go if you think back to the [personal computer] days."" Looking beyond electric vehicles Other investors are holding out hope for Tesla, viewing ventures beyond its bread-and-butter auto business as key to the company's recovery. During an interview with CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin this week, Ark Investment Management CEO Cathie Wood said Tesla shares could hit $2,000 over the next five years as artificial intelligence, robotics and energy storage themes play out. The comments from Wood came one day after her firm purchased nearly $40 million worth of Tesla shares. ""This reminds me very much of 2018-19,"" she said. ""We're in a bit of a trading range, and we will be until more and more analysts and investors understand how provocative the convergence of these three technologies is going to be."" Wood isn't alone in backing Tesla. Altimeter Capital's Brad Gerstner revealed last month a fresh bet on the EV maker , citing its future artificial intelligence prospects and saying the stock already reflects investor bearishness. While the stock will be volatile, he argued that backing Elon Musk and AI was a ""no-brainer."" A lack of investor understanding of the value of these alternative businesses and their future contribution to Tesla profits is plaguing Tesla shares, according to Corestone Capital's Will McDonough. TSLA 1Y mountain Tesla shares over the last year ""Valuing Tesla as a car company is akin to valuing Amazon as a book sale company,"" the investor said. ""You're just not seeing the full picture here."" But even those bullish on the stock's long-term potential expect a rough patch ahead. ""There are definitely concerns in the marketplace around demand"" for Tesla vehicles, said Robert W. Baird senior research analyst Ben Kallo. ""Some investors are willing to look out [farther] … but there are still the near-term worries. We're in for a choppy quarter or two more.""

532,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/05/elon-musk-says-tesla-will-unveil-its-robotaxi-on-aug-8-shares-pop.html,TSLA,"Tesla, Inc.",Elon Musk says Tesla will unveil its robotaxi on Aug. 8; shares pop,"Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla and owner of X, formerly known as Twitter, attends the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at the Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris, France, June 16, 2023.

Tesla will reveal its robotaxi product on Aug. 8, CEO Elon Musk said in a social media post on X.

Musk has promised shareholders a robotaxi for years, but has not yet managed to deliver on his self-driving dreams and promises. A date for the unveiling event comes as some investors grow wary of the company during a period of slowing growth.

Tesla shares rose over 3% in extended trading after Musk's tweet.

Musk shared the reveal date on Friday after Reuters earlier reported that plans for a highly anticipated low-cost electric car by Tesla had been scrapped. Musk accused Reuters of ""lying"" without specifying any incorrect detail of their story.

In 2015, Elon Musk told shareholders that Tesla's cars would achieve ""full autonomy"" within three years. In 2016, he said Tesla would able to send one of its cars on a cross-country drive without requiring any human intervention by the end of the following year.

In 2019 during a fundraising call, Musk told investors that Tesla expected to have 1 million vehicles on the road the next year that would be able to function as ""robotaxis."" Each car should be able to do 100 hours of work a week for its owner, making money as a robotaxi he told investors at that time.

Tesla still has yet to deliver a robotaxi, autonomous vehicle or technology that can turn its cars into ""level 3"" automated vehicles. However, Tesla offers advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), including a standard Autopilot option or premium Full Self-Driving ""FSD"" option, the latter of which costs $199 per month for U.S. subscribers or $12,000 upfront.

In a push for end-of-quarter sales last month, Musk mandated that all sales and service staff install and demo FSD for customers before handing over the keys. He wrote in an email to employees, ""Almost no one actually realizes how well (supervised) FSD actually works. I know this will slow down the delivery process, but it is nonetheless a hard requirement.""

Despite its name, Tesla's premium option requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any moment.

Musk has continued to bet that Tesla customers and shareholders will stick with the Tesla brand regardless of self-driving delays, and regardless of his incendiary rhetoric on X, the social network he acquired in 2022 and now runs as CTO while also running Tesla, and the rocket and satellite internet company, SpaceX.

Some autonomous vehicle competitors are gaining ground.

Alphabet's autonomous vehicle unit Waymo operates commercial, driverless ride-hailing services in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and is ramping up in Tesla's home base of Austin, Texas. Waymo also recently struck a multi-year partnership with Uber and will put its robotaxis to use delivering food for Uber Eats in Arizona. In China, Didi's autonomous unit operates commercially in markets including Guangzhou. Companies including Wayve in the U.K. and Zoox in the U.S. continue testing their robotaxis.

Other companies have had a tough time in the crowded market.

On Friday, Apple shuttered its self-driving unit and laid off about 600 people on Friday who had been associated with the project. GM's Cruise service previously offered self-driving car services in San Francisco before being wound down under regulatory scrutiny after an accident. Since the incident, Cruise's robotaxi fleet has been grounded, local and federal governments have launched their own investigations and Cruise leadership has been gutted.

At Tesla, ""unveil"" dates do not predict a near-future date for a commercial release of a new product. For example, Tesla unveiled its fully electric heavy-duty truck, the Semi, in 2017 and did not begin deliveries until December 2022. It still produces and sells very few Semis to this day.",4/5/2024,-2,0.002184048,0.974022925,0.001393071,0.014208008,0.007445666,0.000746147
533,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/07/xiaomi-breaks-into-the-china-ev-scene-in-direct-competition-with-tesla.html,TSLA,"Tesla, Inc.",A Chinese smartphone maker is breaking into EVs and challenging Tesla. How the stock rates now.,"Just as the auto industry was grappling with BYD 's rapid rise, Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi has burst into the market — undercutting Tesla and vowing to become a global player. Even as Apple this year scrapped development of an electric, self-driving car , Xiaomi's founder and CEO Lei Jun pledged that making a car will not only be his final legacy project, but a product that turns the company into one of the top five automakers in the world in the next two decades. Xiaomi's Hong Kong-listed shares soared last week to a two-year high after the company introduced its electric SU7 sedan at a price about $4,000 cheaper than Tesla's Model 3 — and with similar tech capabilities. Wider analyst attention In the last several days, Xiaomi has gained wider attention from auto and tech industry analysts beyond those who previously covered it as only a smartphone play. ""Add Xiaomi to the list of capable China auto/tech firms that may represent attractive collaboration candidates as Western legacy auto firms look for ways to achieve higher scale, improved capital discipline and lower execution risks,"" Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas said in a note Thursday. Meanwhile, Tesla last week revealed that its deliveries fell in the first quarter from a year ago . Excluding Covid, that was the first decline in Tesla deliveries since 2012, Jonas pointed out. While he still likes Tesla longer-term , he and his team will hold a client webinar on Xiaomi, Tesla and global EVs on Tuesday. ""If Xiaomi can continue to outperform peers on [driver assist] and smart cabin features, we believe it is likely to become a disruption force with large growth potential,"" Morgan Stanley's greater China tech hardware analyst, Andy Meng, said in a note Monday. Meng reiterated the bank's overweight rating on Xiaomi, and its price target of 17.50 Hong Kong dollars ($2.24). Xiaomi shares nearly reached that price during last week's surge. The stock later gave back much of those gains, and are now little changed on the year. Meanwhile, Tesla shares are down 34% year to date. On Wednesday, Xiaomi said it had received more than 100,000 orders for the SU7, more than 40,000 of which were already locked in and not subject to cancellation. The same day, it held a ceremony celebrating its first batch of car deliveries. Six-month wait times Most customers face wait times of nearly six months or longer, according to Xiaomi's online sales platform. Taylor Ogan, Shenzhen-based CEO of Snow Bull Capital, said that he's watching to see how consumers actually like driving the car before he commits to buying Xiaomi shares. ""I don't think it will do particularly well for the stock price [in] the next two quarters,"" he said in an interview Friday. ""After that, this could be a cash cow. This is something that every single avid Xiaomi ecosystem user needs."" Months ahead of the car launch, Xiaomi announced a new operating system called HyperOS and a strategy to connect consumers with their homes and cars. The company makes most of its revenue from smartphones, but a significant share also comes from a range of home appliances, many of which are controlled using an app. During the recent SU7 launch, Xiaomi CEO Lei touted that when a driver neared home, connected lights and appliances could automatically turn on to pre-determined settings. Such an ecosystem offers ""a built-in recurring revenue model that every CEO would dream of,"" Ogan said. ""On top of that, you can have subscriptions."" He said he sees low odds that the SU7 flops, but said it would be difficult for Xiaomi to recover if the car does disappoint expectations. Although Xiaomi is trying to build out its own ecosystem, the company also supports Apple's Car Play system and iPads. ""We believe the ultimate outcome [of Xiaomi's EV market entry] would be a faster BEV/NEV penetration in China, thus ICE brands or products would be the main losers,"" JPMorgan's Nick Lai, head of China equity research and head of APAC auto research, said in a note Monday. He was referring to internal combustion engines, battery electric vehicles and new energy vehicles. Recognition and cash Xiaomi's advantages include existing brand recognition in China, and 110 billion yuan ($15.7 billion) in cash on its balance sheet that can help the company weather a near-term price war, the report said. Lei has said that Xiaomi is currently producing each car at a loss, but noted the company invested in its own factory to boost production. It's not clear whether the facility is fully operational yet, but Lei claimed last month the factory could churn out an SU7 every 76 seconds in a nearly fully-automated process. ""Xiaomi also showcased its EV factory with highly automated production lines for key processes (painting, stamping, die casting, body assembly etc.), backed by its smart manufacturing expertise. We believe high degree of automation should help accelerate its EV profitability improvement in the mid to long term,"" JPMorgan technology analyst Gokul Hariharan said in a separate note. The bank has an overweight investment recommendation on Xiaomi, with a price target of 21 Hong Kong dollars. That's about 35% above where the stock closed Friday. One risk is China's ability to produce electric cars at prices far below overseas competitors has prompted warnings that trade tensions will grow. Only Friday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen emphasized concerns about China's overcapacity as she kicked off high-level meetings in the country. But while Xiaomi has hinted at overseas car plans, it has promised to focus on the China market first. Right now, it sells smartphones globally, but not in the U.S.",4/7/2024,2,0.33806935,0.543998718,0.006154488,0.104318589,0.00578682,0.001672017
534,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/05/tesla-scraps-low-cost-car-plans-amid-fierce-chinese-ev-competition-reuters.html,TSLA,"Tesla, Inc.",Tesla scraps low-cost car plans amid fierce Chinese EV competition: Reuters,"Tesla has canceled the long-promised inexpensive car that investors have been counting on to drive its growth into a mass-market automaker, according to three sources familiar with the matter and company messages seen by Reuters.

The automaker will continue developing self-driving robotaxis on the same small-vehicle platform, the sources said. The decision represents an abandonment of a longstanding goal that Tesla chief Elon Musk has often characterized as its primary mission: affordable electric cars for the masses. His first ""master plan"" for the company in 2006 called for manufacturing luxury models first, then using the profits to finance a ""low cost family car.""

Tesla shares were down by 6% in late morning trading after the Reuters report.

Musk has since repeatedly promised such a vehicle to investors and consumers. As recently as January, Musk told investors that Tesla planned to start production of the affordable model at its Texas factory in the second half of 2025, following an exclusive Reuters report detailing those plans.

Tesla's cheapest current model, the Model 3 sedan, retails for about $39,000 in the United States. The now-defunct entry-level vehicle, sometimes described as the Model 2, was expected to start at about $25,000.

Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.

The stark reversal comes as Tesla faces fierce competition globally from Chinese electric-vehicle makers flooding the market with cars priced as low as $10,000. The plan for driverless robotaxis, which could take longer to deliver, presents a stiffer engineering challenge and more regulatory risk.

Two sources said they learned of Tesla's decision to scrap the Model 2 in a meeting attended by scores of employees, with one of them saying the gathering happened in late February.

""Elon's directive is to go all in on robotaxi,"" that person said.

The third source confirmed the cancellation and said new plans call for robotaxis to be produced, but in much lower volumes than had been projected for the Model 2.

Several company messages reviewed by Reuters about the decision included one on March 1 from an unnamed program manager for the affordable car discussing the project's demise with engineering staff and advising them to hold off on telling suppliers ""about program cancellation.""

A fourth person with knowledge of Tesla's plans expressed optimism about the decision to pivot away from the cheap-car strategy in favor of robotaxis, a segment Musk has envisioned as the future of mobility. The source cautioned that Tesla's product plans could change again based on economic conditions. Squeezing profits from entry-level vehicles is a challenge for any automaker. But Tesla's delay in pursuing the car Musk once called his dream made it much tougher because it now faces far more competition in that price range.

While Tesla spent years developing its highly experimental Cybertruck, a pricey electric pickup, Chinese automakers have raced ahead on affordable EVs, grabbing market share, gaining economies of scale and offering consumers bargain prices that Western automakers are struggling to match.

As Chinese EVs surged to challenge Tesla's dominance, Musk was tending to his sprawling empire, which includes rocket-maker SpaceX, brain-chip developer Neuralink, and social media giant X, which Musk acquired in 2022. Formerly called Twitter, the platform has foundered under Musk's volatile management, shedding most of its value as the company has lost revenue and advertisers.

Plans for the affordable Tesla have been seen as key to delivering on Musk's stratospheric ambitions for sales growth. Musk said in 2020 that Tesla aspired by 2030 to sell 20 million vehicles – twice as many as the world's largest automaker, Toyota, sells today. With the death of the Model 2, it's unclear how he'll get there.

Expectations for a $25,000 vehicle have underpinned Wall Street analysts' more modest, but still ambitious, forecasts for Tesla sales. Those forecasts, according to a Tesla investor-relations document, call for vehicle sales rising to 4.2 million by 2028 from 1.8 million last year.

Musk has wavered on the project before. In a biography of the entrepreneur released last year, author Walter Issacson reported that Musk in 2022 ""put a hold on"" the entry-level EV plans, reasoning that a Tesla robotaxi would make the car irrelevant. Musk's advisors urged him to stay the course, the book said.",4/5/2024,-2,0.064301327,0.084757298,0.002021356,0.814582348,0.032751609,0.001586055

""This process may take a few more quarters to see through, over which time our $100 bear case may be 'in play',"" the analyst wrote in a report Thursday. The $100 bear case suggests that Tesla could fall more than 40% from Wednesday's close. Shares of the electric vehicle maker have come under pressure in recent months, falling 33% this year, as competition mounts in China and demand wanes. Earlier this week, Tesla reported an 8.5% decline in first-quarter deliveries compared to a year ago. These issues could hamstring Tesla near term, but Jonas expects deliveries to find a bottom in the second quarter. In fact, he views Tesla as a combination of an auto, energy, AI and robotics stock, noting that its auto business represents only 20% of Morgan Stanley's $310 price target valuation. ""At the same time, however, we believe investors should not ignore the continued developments of Tesla's other plays, many of which are auto-related (i.e. the recurring revenue opportunity from the Tesla fleet – embedded in our Tesla Network Services valuation) and other areas that we do not include within our $310 target,"" he said.

Russia is still obtaining large volumes of Western technology critical to its war in Ukraine, even as sanctions show some sign of taking hold, new analysis shows. China, Hong Kong, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates have been increasingly important in funneling critical components to Russia, according to new research, as supply chains have adapted in response to export controls aimed at choking off Moscow's military machine. In response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, a Western coalition of allies including Japan and South Korea imposed a series of sanctions restricting the sale of certain goods to Russia, including advanced technologies for use in the military. Yet Western-origin technologies still accounted for almost half of all Russian imports of critical components and ""high-priority"" battlefield goods in the first three quarters of 2023, according to research from Ukrainian think tank KSE Institute and the Yermak-McFaul International Working Group, which promotes sanctions against Russia. Such products are typically designed by companies headquartered in Western coalition countries, but manufactured and distributed abroad — often making their supply chains harder to police. Earlier CNBC investigations indicated that these third-country intermediaries are generally based in countries without direct sanctions on Russia — primarily China, as well as Turkey and the UAE. Moscow imported more than $22 billion worth of critical components between January and October 2023, Russian trade data shows. Over the same period, it also imported almost $9 billion worth of ""high-priority"" battlefield components, which Western authorities have specifically sanctioned. Such goods include microchips, communications equipment, computer components, bearings and transmission shafts, and navigation and sensor devices — which can be used in a range of military equipment including drones, radios, missiles and armored vehicles.

The trade flows mark an uptick from the first six months of the Russia-Ukraine war, when Russian imports dropped off dramatically. When compared to pre-war levels, however, the figures point to a downward trend, with Russian imports of critical components and battlefield goods down 29% and 10%, respectively. The report's authors said the data suggests that some export controls are working, and that Russia has been unable to find reliable substitutes for many Western components. They noted that more needs to be done to bolster enforcement and clamp down on remaining loopholes. ""We are finally starting to see this slow but somewhat positive trend,"" Olena Bilousova, senior research lead at KSE Institute and one of the report's authors, told CNBC. ""Sanctions are not a measure you can enforce and expect to see the effects tomorrow."" The findings mirror comments made Tuesday by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said that there were ""clear signs of a slowdown"" in Russia's defense industry. Zelenskyy did not provide evidence for his assertion, and Russia has separately said that its production of military equipment has stepped up.

U.S. tech continues to enter Russia

According to the new research, products originating from U.S.-headquartered companies accounted for the second-largest share of Russian imported battlefield goods (27%) and critical components (19%) after China. The U.S. products originated from companies including tech giants Intel, Analog Devices, Advanced Micro Devices and Texas Instruments — all of whose equipment has been found in Russian weaponry on the battlefield in Ukraine, according to KSE. While the data points to a slowdown in the supply of products from some companies in 2023 versus 2022, including Intel and AMD, it also suggests an increase for others, namely Analog and Texas.

These upticks can't go unnoticed by internal controls. Olena Bilousova senior research lead at KSE Institute

Bilousova said the trends indicate that such products are still finding their way to Russia, ""and, moreover, their volumes are increasing"" over time. ""These upticks can't go unnoticed by internal controls,"" she added. CNBC reached out to the companies cited and all of them said that they had ceased trading with Russia in the wake of the war and that their operations were in compliance with sanctions. In a statement, Analog Devices said that any post-sanctions shipments to Russia were a ""direct violation of our policy and the result of an unauthorized resale or diversion."" Meanwhile, Intel said that it is actively working to ""track and mitigate potential distributor issues."" Texas Instruments said that it ""strongly oppose(s) our chips' use in Russian military equipment and the illicit diversion of our products to Russia,"" and that it takes action if it learns that its distributors do not comply with export controls. AMD similarly said it ""does not condone and works to disrupt the malign use of our products in Russian military equipment"" and that it operates compliance and monitoring programs to prevent such use. The report's findings highlight the continued challenges faced by the industry in monitoring its complex supply chains. In a January 2023 blogpost, the Semiconductor Industry Association, which represents around 99% of the U.S. semiconductor industry and around two-thirds of non-U.S. chip firms, highlighted the issue, but said the industry was ""deeply committed"" to working with the U.S. and allied governments to address the ""illicit diversion"" of its technology.

Russia's advanced machine tool imports soar

Elsewhere, the report also highlighted a significant increase in Russian imports of a class of advanced machine tools critical to Moscow's military production since the start of the war. Russia imported $189 million of ""computer numerical control"" machinery between January and October 2023, according to KSE analysis. It marks an 88% increase versus pre-war levels, with the majority of these tools coming from Western coalition countries.

CNC machines are automated industrial tools widely used in the aerospace, automotive and defense industries. Their applications can include the production of weapon hulls, aircraft parts, missile and drone components, and microelectronics. Such goods became the target of U.S. and EU sanctions in late 2023, making it more complicated and expensive for Russia to obtain them. However, new indications suggest that China may be stepping in to plug that gap. Chinese shipments to Russia of CNC tools have increased tenfold since the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, according to an FT analysis of Russian trade data released last week.

Reinforcing economic sanctions

Given the potential impact of sanctions — and their clear failure in some cases — Western authorities must now do more to improve enforcement, the report's authors said. Elina Ribakova, director at KSE Institute, said policymakers must demand greater corporate responsibility, while closing policy gaps in Russian export controls, including tackling circumvention via third countries. ""Without the private sector piece, we're just not going to move forward,"" Ribakova said. ""And from the policy side, there is no signal what that policy would be so they don't want to stick their heads above the parapet."" Additionally, she called for greater cooperation between enforcement agencies in coalition countries to improve the robustness of the sanctions regime more broadly.

It's not just about the effectiveness of the Russian sanctions. It is also about the credibility of the entire sanctions regime. Benjamin Hilgenstock senior economist at KSE Institute

Closing the gaps in sanctions enforcement could prove critical not only to Ukraine's victory but also to the integrity of export controls more broadly. ""It's not just about the effectiveness of the Russian sanctions. It is also about the credibility of the entire sanctions regime,"" KSE's senior economist Benjamin Hilgenstock said. ""Technology sanctions are rightfully seen as a new frontier in economic statecraft."" That is something Western policymakers will need to keep front of mind as they confront other geopolitical tensions, including with an increasingly assertive Beijing, Ribakova added. ""If they cannot even limit Russia, it is really not clear how they plan to do foreign direct policy on China,"" she said.

The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.51 per share on $4.97 billion of revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting $1.54 per share on $4.98 billion of revenue. Kimberly-Clark's operating margin fell year over year, due in part to currency exchange costs. Elevance Health — Shares inched higher after Elevance Health topped Wall Street's expectations even as health insurance memberships came in below expectations. The company hiked its dividend by 10% and offered strong full-year guidance. Abbott Laboratories — The health-care stock slipped 2.8% on the heels of the company's earnings report.

Managing director John Baumgartner listed the pair as his two top picks among large food stocks for the new year. Both have buy ratings from the company. Mondelez, the maker of Oreo and Ritz, is Baumgartner's growth pick. His $83 price target implies a 13.8% upside. The company was able to advance what Baumgartner called a ""very under-appreciated global revenue growth story"" in 2023. For the 2024 fiscal year, he said the company's revenue and earnings per share growth should once again outperform the long-term algorithm. ""Although MDLZ's growth in developing markets is unlikely to sustain +20% again in FY24, we believe new distribution growth and associated market share gains help to limit downside risks should category growth slow more than expected,"" he said. ""Further, we expect ongoing contribution from cost efficiencies to fund reinvestment and provide incremental support for EPS growth."" Baumgartner selected Kraft Heinz as his best large-cap growth idea. He has a $43 target for the stock, reflecting an upside of 16.2%. More active and profitable retail merchandising can boost Kraft Heinz's North American market, the analyst said, while international markets could see 5% growth. He's also watching for any information about new overhead cost efficiencies. Both stocks have inched higher since 2024 kicked off, but the pair diverged in 2023. While Mondelez jumped more than 8% last year, Kraft Heinz slid more than 9%. — Alex Harring 8:21 a.m.: Evercore ISI upgraded IBM, cites 'underappreciated AI tailwinds' Investors may be overlooking IBM's AI opportunities, according to Evercore ISI. Analyst Amit Daryanani upgraded the technology company to an outperform rating, citing ""underappreciated AI tailwinds"" that should boost the company's consulting and software businesses. ""We think as Enterprises look to deploy AI tools to enhance productivity – the process will be complicated and messy, furthermore we think data security and not running enterprise data on public LLM models will be a key focus – IBM with their unique set of consulting and software assets can help solve this bottleneck and enable enterprise customers to deploy AI tools on and off premise more seamlessly,"" he said in a Friday note. Looking ahead, the analyst expects IBM to benefit from enhanced enterprise IT spending to improve productivity, anticipating a lift in demand for its Watsonx software suite. Demand for AI could also bring its consulting practice to a $1 billion business. Given this outlook, Daryanani lifted the firm's price target to $200 from $165 a share, reflecting 20% upside from Thursday's close. Shares gained more than 2% before the bell. — Samantha Subin 8:19 a.m.: Bank of America downgrades Celsius, citing stronger energy drink competition Energy drink stock Celsius may be close to hitting a wall, according to Bank of America. Analyst Jonathan Keypour downgraded the beverage stock to neutral from buy, saying in a note to clients that the company's recent sales slowdown could be a sign that renewed competition is hurting momentum for Celsius. ""CELH US sales continue to be very strong with considerable opportunity supported by rising consumer awareness. However, it remains unclear if recent market share and velocity (dollar sales per points of distribution) declines are merely seasonal or not. With Monster (MNST) pushing to expand Reign Storm and reclaim lost Bang distribution, and Red Bull maintaining strong marketing, competition could weigh on growth this year,"" the note said. Shares of Celsius have nearly doubled over the past 12 months, but the stock peaked in September and has struggled since then. Bank of America has a price target of $65 per share on Celsius, which is less than 10% above where the stock closed on Thursday. The price would still put Celsius at a valuation premium compared to Monster, the note said. — Jesse Pound 8:03 a.m.: Block is on track for 'best-in-class' EPS growth, BMO Capital Markets says BMO Capital Markets thinks Block could be on pace for exceptional earnings growth moving forward.

BMO's forecast implies more than 30% upside from Thursday's $64.47 close. The stock has slipped nearly 17% from the start of the year. ""We continue to expect SQ to deliver best-in-class EPS growth (doubling through 2025E, with further meaningful growth in 2026E) and sequential improvement in SQ's adjusted operating margin throughout 2024E (reaching 13% by 4Q24E),"" analyst Rufus Hone said. — Brian Evans 7:53 a.m.: Buy beat-down AT & T, Oppenheimer recommends Oppenheimer sees multiple reasons for optimism on AT & T despite underperformance.

""We like the stock setup in 2024 on continued AI optics growth, layering of custom ASIC AI project sales, and bottoming out of noncloud markets like enterprise networking and carrier,"" he told clients in a Friday note. Meanwhile, he bumped Nvidia, an artificial intelligence darling and member of the ""Magnificent 7,"" down to the second-favorite stock slot. His downgrade follows a run of more than 20% in shares heading into a popular trade show and the expiration of the firm's positive catalyst watch. Both stocks have performed well recently. Marvell has climbed more than 13% so far in the new year, building on 2023's advance of nearly 63%. Nvidia has added more than 15% in 2024, adding to last year's whopping return of almost 239%. Marvell shares rose 1.7% before the bell on Friday. NVDA MRVL 1Y mountain MRVL and NVDA in past year — Alex Harring 7:03 a.m.: 2024 is the 'Year of the Temu', Bernstein says Bernstein reiterated PDD Holdings as its top Chinese internet stock pick for the new quarter while shouting out its increasingly popular e-commerce brand. Analyst Robin Zhu raised his price target on U.S. shares of the Chinese company by $10 to $180, now implying an upside of 26.7% over Thursday's close. He also has an outperform rating on the stock. Zhu called 2024 the ""Year of the Temu,"" a reference to PDD's online marketplace. He said Temu continues to grow above expectations in China and can outperform Wall Street estimates for 2024. The analyst said there's a case to make for expecting more upside to shares in the new year, even after the stock climbed more than 79% in 2023. To be sure, shares have pulled back almost 3% in the new year. ""Even amid a challenging environment for China top-down, we don't think it's ambitious to call for PDD valuation to go from a low teens multiple of domestic 2024E profits to a similar multiple of 2025E profit,"" Zhu wrote to clients. When looking at Temu specifically, Zhu said 2024 can be the year the business ""grows beyond brown envelopes sent via air"" and expands in new markets. But Zhu said aggregate user subsidy levels should fall as markets mature. And the analyst said he may reexamine Temu's valuation if quarterly losses peak or if embattled retailer Shein goes public. — Alex Harring 6:59 a.m.: Loop Capital hikes Netflix price target, says 'dominance is becoming even clearer' Loop Capital sees even more upside ahead for Netflix as its leadership in the streaming space crystalizes. Managing director Alan Gould raised his price target by $35 to $535, now reflecting the potential for shares to rally 10.2% from where they ended Thursday's session. Gould also reiterated his buy rating on the streaming giant. ""The rationalization of the streaming industry is starting and NFLX's dominance is becoming even clearer,"" he wrote to clients Friday. ""As the traditional studios pivot their strategy from profit to growth, not only is the competition raising subscription prices and reducing content spend, but they are again licensing content to NFLX — even DIS and HBO."" Gould noted the stock's recent outperformance, with Netflix shares up about 42% from the company's last earnings report. By comparison, the Magnificent 7 and S & P 500 have climbed around 7% and 11%, respectively, in the same period. Looking ahead, Gould said that the fourth quarter should be the first since 2021 that Netflix reports double-digital revenue growth, a feat he said is largely due to subscriber gains instead of an increase in annual revenue per user. This comes as Netflix has cracked down on password sharing. Gould is also expecting strong guidance for the first quarter, citing quality shows. ""We continue to recommend NFLX despite the strong stock move,"" he said. That's because of ""our view that the competitive environment is improving, consolidation should eliminate some competition, and these factors should lead to upside bias in future estimates."" Gould is more bullish than many on Wall Street, as the average price target of analysts polled by LSEG is $484.42. The highest price target for Netflix is $600, per LSEG. — Alex Harring 6:50 a.m.: Near-term upside hindered for Hertz by EV repair and depreciation challenges, Jefferies says Troubles with electric vehicles is just one of many challenges for Hertz , according to Jefferies. Analyst Harold Antor downgraded the stock to hold from buy and slashed his price target by $4 to $8. Antor's new target price implies a downside of 11%, while his old forecast reflected an upside of 33.5%. ""EV repair issues, higher opex and DPU will limit near-term profitability,"" he wrote to clients, using acronyms for electric vehicle and depreciation per unit. ""Given the remediation of these issues are neither simple nor quick, we don't have a ton of conviction in even our reduced 2024 EBTIDA estimate, limiting near-term upside."" Antor lowered his 2024 EBITDA estimate by 35% to around $500 million. While he said that valuation appears cheap for the stock, he has ""limited confidence"" in estimates for 2024 and 2025 after two consecutive quarters of major misses to Wall Street expectations There's also a ""lack of visibility"" on when elevated expenses tied to electric vehicles, operating expenditures and depreciation will start moderating, the analyst added. Notably, the company announced earlier this month that it would sell about one third of its electric vehicle fleet amid a strategy shift. He said 2024 will be a ""transition year"" for the company as it battles headwinds. Shares slipped 1.5% before the bell on Friday. The stock has dropped about 13.5% in January, taking another leg down after tumbling 32.5% in 2023. — Alex Harring 6:06 a.m.: HSBC becomes less bullish on Discover as earnings forecast sours HSBC moved to the sidelines on Discover as the earnings outlook became less optimistic. Saul Martinez, the firm's head of U.S. financials research, downgraded the bank to hold from buy and cut his price target by $14 to $107. Martinez's new target reflects the potential for upside of 10.3%, down from 24.7% with the previously expected level. His downgrade came Thursday, when Discover posted $1.54 in GAAP EPS, down from $3.74 a year prior. Discover's stock finished the session down more than 10%. Following the report, Martinez reduced his 2024 and 2024 forecasts for EPS by 9% and 15%, respectively. He anticipates deterioration in the loan growth outlook that should weigh on net interest income, while also noting that credit losses should peak in the first half of 2024 at a high rate. ""The reductions largely reflect a softer outlook for loan growth, driving a sharp reduction to our net interest income (NII) estimates,"" he said. ""We also expect much higher net charge offs (NCOs) and some uncertainty persists about the extent to which compliance and risk costs pressure total expenses."" Ultimately, he said the new rating reflects a challenging environment with slower loan growth, higher credit losses and increasing expense levels. But he noted the sale of Discover's student loan portfolio, a return to share buybacks and the eventual easing of credit pressures can all help the stock. — Alex Harring 5:42 a.m.: Buy DraftKings amid correction, Stifel says Stifel doesn't want investors to miss an ongoing opportunity to buy into DraftKings . Analyst Jeffrey Stantial upgrade the sports betting stock to buy from hold and raised his price target by $5 to $45. Stantial's new price target implies shares can jump 19.9% over the next year from Thursday's close. While admitting others may not agree, Stantial said to take advantage of a slight pullback from the late 2023 highs. With near-term headwinds such as seasonality as ESPNBet promotions fading, he said investors can now focus attention on fundamentals such as healthy same-state growth rates, marketing and promotional discipline and efficiencies in fixed costs. Taken together, he said these fundaments can drive up what he deemed an ""already impressive"" path for guided EBITDA. ""Our timing here is not without controversy, as we approach a potential hold-driven Q4 miss & Flutter U.S. listing,"" he wrote to clients. ""However, we prefer to own into forthcoming market share stabilization/inflection vs. waiting to de-risk these catalysts, while valuation appears attractive on our fine-tuned estimates."" Shares popped 1.6% in Friday premarket trading following Stantial's Thursday upgrade. Despite the recent correction, the stock has gained about 6.5% since the start of 2024. That builds on 2023's rally of more than 200%.

During the call, Zuckerberg shared plans to have about 350,000 H100 graphics processing units, which Nvidia makes, by the end of 2024. Alternatively, he said the fellow Big Tech company could seek around 600,000 equivalent processors to the H100. Zuckerberg's update comes as Nvidia, a member of the ""Magnificent 7,"" continues to rally. Shares have climbed more than 15% so far in January, extending gains after surging almost 239% in 2023. More broadly, he called the Meta chief's update a sign of ""continued positive validation that the AI infrastructure buildout remains in its early innings."" — Alex Harring 5:37 a.m.: UBS upgrades Texas Instruments Texas Instruments investors should see a better performance from the stock this year after a lackluster 2023, according to UBS. UBS raised its rating on Texas Instruments to buy and increased its price target to $195 from $170. The new forecast implies upside of nearly 17% from Thursday's close. ""We believe it should be among the first to see orders inflect higher given less reliance on distribution (i.e. for TXN there is very little lag time between orders and revenue turning higher) and TXN also has cleaner comps and fundamentals as it was one of the few companies not to employ supply agreements during the peak,"" wrote analyst Timothy Arcuri. ""The stock trades on orders and FCF – both of which look set to inflect positively,"" he added. The analyst also raised its revenue forecast for 2024 and 2025.

Please refresh every 20-30 minutes to view the latest posts.) An industrial giant and Chinese electric vehicle play were in focus among Friday's analyst calls. JPMorgan upgraded shares of General Electric to overweight. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank initiated Li Auto with a buy rating. Check out the latest calls and chatter below. All times ET. 8:30 a.m.: Melius ups estimates on Advanced Micro Devices, calls stock the 'Nvidia-Mini' Melius Research upped its price target on shares of Advanced Micro Devices to $265 from $192, citing improving data center prospects. ""With a chip optimized for the inferencing explosion, AMD is just getting going as AI models move into production,"" wrote analyst Ben Reitzes. ""While our rapid revisions look like misprints – it shouldn't be all that surprising since you saw what happened with Nvidia last year when buying picked up."" Shares of Advanced Micro Devices have surged 43% so far in 2024, with the firm's price target implying another 25% upside. He anticipates the company's MI300X product to benefit as AI enters its inferencing phases. Reitzes likened AMD's chart to a ""mini-Nvidia on a delay,"" but said that its progress shouldn't have an ""adverse impact"" on Nvidia's momentum given the AI darling's dominant position in the market and the large total addressable market. ""Nvidia continues to do AMD and everyone else a favor by expanding the market and driving awareness,"" he said. — Samantha Subin 8:18 a.m.: Citi hikes price target for Instacart Instacart has the runway to continue its hot start to the year, according to Citi. Analyst Ronald Josey reiterated a buy rating on Instacart and raised the price target to $42 per share from $36, citing improved visibility into orders. The new target is more than 20% above where the stock closed Thursday. ""While we acknowledge competition is ramping across the online grocery sector, we believe Instacart's longstanding partner relationships, its deep technology integrations, and order history create significant competitive advantages,"" Josey said in a note to clients. The valuation for instacart remains attractive even if its growth profile is not eye-popping, according to Citi. ""Growth remains below that of its online grocery peers, but with shares trading at ~10x our '25 EV/EBITDA, we believe the risk-reward is favorable as execution continues to improve,"" the note said. The stock has already jumped more than 40% year to date. — Jesse Pound 7:34 a.m.: Bank of America downgrades Vail Resorts on weak visitation Despite improving snow conditions, Vail Resorts isn't seeing a strong rebound in visitation, Bank of America said. The bank downgraded the ski resort to neutral from buy, citing a more challenging setup from here. Analyst Shaun Kelley sees a risk to Vail's full-year guidance due to the weak visitation and a risk to its 2025 estimates as its year-over-year organic growth is slower than anticipated. Vail had already narrowed its guidance to the lower half of its original guidance after the season got off to a weak start. ""We think this was predicated on trends improving through the season, which now seems optimistic given 1) Placer visitation to domestic resorts is -8% Y/Y since the early season update, and 2) recent Inntopia mountain lodging data shows winter (Nov-April) occupancy -6% Y/Y,"" Kelley said. He also lowered his price target to $250 from $285, suggesting nearly 11% upside from Thursday's close. — Michelle Fox 7:31 a.m.: Bank of America upgrades aircraft manufacturer Textron to a buy rating Textron has room to fly higher, according to Bank of America. The bank upgraded shares of the aircraft manufacturer to a buy rating from neutral. Textron stock has popped 12% this year, but the bank's updated price target of $105, up from $85, implies that there is still room for a further 16% upside. ""Textron has been one of our better performing large caps YTD, up 12.31% (vs. S & P 500 +8.17%). However, concerns around Industrials, falling bizjet demand, and poor defense sentiment have peaked, translating into a multiple that is roughly one standard deviation below the historical average,"" wrote analyst Ronald Epstein. ""Our higher multiple accounts for 1) stronger Aviation performance despite the post-COVID demand decline, 2) efforts to consolidate costs at Industrial, and 3) a robust Systems pipeline that should materialize in stronger outyear growth,"" Epstein said. Due to the company's aging portfolio and possible future budgetary cuts, Epstein provided the caveat that his relative multiple remains below Textron's historical average. One catalyst the analyst cited was a strong outlook this year for the aviation industry. And although industrials remain underappreciated by the market, Textron is making the right moves to cut costs and unlock underlaying business value such as through reducing headcount, Epstein said. ""Fundamental conditions remain strong, and demand and utilization remain above historical norms,"" he wrote. ""Near-term revenues are buffered by an already robust backlog. We now expect 2024 revenue growth of 13.6% Y/Y."" Meanwhile, the company plans to prioritize share buybacks through 2024, an approach which should be well-received by investors, the analyst added. — Lisa Kailai Han 7:08 a.m.: Goldman Sachs upgrades Coinbase, pointing to crypto tailwinds Shares of Coinbase could continue to rally alongside the crypto market, according to Goldman Sachs. The investment bank upgraded shares of the cryptocurrency exchange platform to a neutral rating from sell, citing bitcoin's moves to all-time highs as a catalyst. Increased retail participation has pushed Coinbase's daily volumes to between $3 billion to $5 billion, levels not seen since 2021, analyst Will Nance said. Shares of Coinbase have rallied 40% this year, alongside the broader cryptocurrency market. Nance's 12-month price target of $282, up from $170, implies that there could be another 16% to go. ""We attribute the outperformance in shares to the significant increase in crypto prices, as well as the company's commitment to managing towards more consistent profitability over time, which we had underestimated,"" the analyst wrote. ""While we still see limited use cases for crypto at present, the 'beta' to the price action has significantly outweighed any alpha from not seeing an acceleration in retail adoption over time."" The company's renewed commitment to increasing profitability while controlling expenses presents another tailwind. Coinbase could also benefit from higher interest rates, due to the firm's revenue shares in interest income. Nance also attributed Coinbase's outperformance to more focused regulation in the crypto market. ""Ultimately this regulatory crackdown has benefited Coinbase given its historical focus on regulatory compliance, manifested in trading market share gains over this timeframe (despite a dramatically smaller market),"" he wrote. — Lisa Kailai Han 6:58 a.m.: D.A. Davidson upgrades MongoDB, sees room to rally D.A. Davidson sees positive upside ahead for MongoDB . The firm upgraded shares of the database stock to a buy rating from neutral. Analyst Rudy Kessinger accompanied this move by raising his price target to $430 from $405. Shares of MongoDB are fractionally higher this year. Kessinger's updated price target indicates that they could edge 4% higher from here. ""We are buyers on the weakness as the FY25 guide is very conservative, particularly on implied Atlas growth,"" the analyst wrote. ""We see significant upside to estimates as likely throughout the year & find shares attractive at 13x EV/CY25 Rev with that in mind."" Kessinger noted that the firm's first-quarter and full-year guidance for the year 2025 remain on the lower end. ""This seems very, very conservative, particularly as consumption growth in FY25 is expected to be similar to FY24, newer products such as Relational Migrator will likely drive stronger new workload acquisition, and mgmt. is accelerating sales capacity additions,"" he wrote. Furthermore, Kessinger believes that artificial intelligence could be a long-term growth driver for the firm. ""Mgmt. noted that it's going to take AI applications being deployed at scale for it to really positively impact their business, which is expected to be 'at least another year' out,"" he added. — Lisa Kailai Han 6:56 a.m.: Victoria's Secret gets double downgraded by Bank of America Underwhelming comparable sales and weaker-than-expected guidance have Bank of America throwing in the towel on Victoria's Secret . Analyst Alice Xiao downgraded the stock to underperform from buy. She also slashed her price target to $15 from $34. The new target calls for a 16.7% decline. The stock this week has lost more than 36% after the company reported full-year operating income guidance that was well below what the Street expected. VSCO mountain 2024-03-01 VSCO this week ""We see risk to F24 sales guidance, as it assumes the broader lingerie market will stabilize in 2H after declining MSD in 1H, as well as the impact of initiatives in sport and technology materializing,"" Xiao wrote. ""We see downside risk to these assumptions should the broader lingerie market continue its secular decline throughout the year given the deflationary shift to less structured, more casual, and multi-functional bras."" 6:36 a.m.: Citi cuts Apple price target, moves stock down from top picks Apple's woes aren't likely to evaporate anytime soon, according to Citi. The bank lowered its price target for the tech titan to $220 from $225, implying that shares still have a potential 33% upside from their Thursday closing price of $169. The ""Magnificent Seven"" member is down 12% so far in 2024, weighed down by weak iPhone sales in the Chinese market. At least in the near term, analyst Atif Malik expects this trend to continue. ""We lower our Mar-Q China unit estimates modestly down by 0.4M, or -21% Y/Y from prior -17% on continued weak consumer confidence and Huawei patriotism,"" he wrote. ""We now model total iPhone units flat in CY24 at 231M."" However, Malik underscored that premiumization supported by services growth and AI smartphones is enough to justify his buy rating on the stock. Citi also moved Apple down from its previous status as its number-two communications stock pick, ""as the upside case of AI adoption in smartphones appears more of a 2025 event,"" Malik wrote. — Lisa Kailai Han 6:23 a.m.: RBC upgrades Carvana to sector perform from underperform RBC Capital Markets is betting that a bright outlook could push Carvana higher from here. The firm upgraded shares of the automobile e-commerce platform to sector perform from underperform. Analyst Brad Erickson more than doubled his price forecast for the stock to $90 from $45, implying that shares could rise 13% from here. Carvana has already rallied an eye-watering 50% this year. CVNA YTD mountain CVNA year to date ""We believe CVNA's recent run has the potential to trade even higher before reasonable valuations may matter again making risk/reward on an Underperform rating infeasible for the foreseeable future,"" Erickson wrote. The analyst added that an ""extremely favorable"" setup in Carvana's unit acceleration could push the stock ""well above"" $100. Meanwhile, he believes that analysts may be underestimating the company's amount of cash generation per car. ""Investors routinely note the company burns significant cash/ car when normalizing for quarterly fluctuations in inventory and timing differences between finance receivable originations and sales,"" he noted. ""After spending time with the company, it appears further adjustment below the operating cash flows is necessary to reflect steady state operations and points to modest cash burn in Q3 and cash generation/car in Q4 steady state,"" the analyst added. Although Carvana owes an estimated $7.4 billion in the next seven years, Erickson believes the company's improvements in per car profitability could provide some leeway to cover future debt costs. ""This, combined with any further rise in the stock would become self-reinforcing, enable improving access to refinancing and reduces any lingering future liquidity concerns even further,"" he added. — Lisa Kailai Han 5:56 a.m.: Oppenheimer downgrades Figs as near-term challenges linger Time to move to the sidelines on Figs , according to Oppenheimer. The firm downgraded shares of the health care apparel company to perform from outperform. Analyst Brian Nagel accompanied this change by removing his price target for the stock, which was previously set to $9. Figs is down 23% this year, but Nagel still doesn't believe the stock has presented an attractive enough entry point for investors to buy in. ""While the valuation of FIGS tracks well below recent highs, multiples for shares are not necessarily 'washed out' and still somewhat susceptible to further unfavorable rerating amid prospects for ongoing, nearer-term fundamental malaise,"" he wrote. While Nagel remains constructive in the long term on Figs, he said the company faces too many internal and external challenges in the near term to ignore. ""2024 is shaping up as another post-pandemic, transitional year for FIGS, impacted by stepped up, somewhat 'catch up' related, outsized investment spending, and still sluggish purchasing activity, on the part of core consumers,"" he wrote. ""While we are optimistic that sub-algo trends in 2024 are likely to give way to strengthening dynamics in subsequent periods, we are hard-pressed, at least at this juncture, to envision meaningful upside to current subdued, nearer-term forecasts and guidance for FIGS,"" Nagel added Nagel thinks these concerns will translate to EBITDA margins slowing to 11-12% in 2024, down from 15.8% in 2023. Additionally, he also expects the company's top-line expansion to be depressed. — Lisa Kailai Han 5:48 a.m.: Morgan Stanley upgrades UBS to overweight, cites pickup in investment banking activity A pickup in investment banking activity could lead to big windfalls for UBS , according to Morgan Stanley. Analyst Giulia Aurora Miotto upgraded the bank stock to overweight from equal weight. U.S.-listed shares of UBS have edged nearly 4% lower this year, but Miotto thinks they could recover as the bank finally realizes the tailwinds from its acquisition of rival Credit Suisse. UBS YTD mountain UBS year to date ""2024 and 2025 will be transitional years as UBS executes on the merger with CS,"" she wrote. ""But our analysis suggests that cyclically the stars are aligned for IB and WM to outperform, leading UBS to beat rebased estimates."" Miotto expects a strong comeback of the investment banking pipeline in 2024 and 2025, and predicts that cash will flow away from the money market into fixed income first and then equities. ""We think these trends are very supportive to UBS's business model and are not captured in consensus yet (we are 20% higher on IBD revenues for UBS),"" she added. Meanwhile, UBS' wealth management business is a fantastic driver over the long run. ""Long-term, we like the exposure to Wealth management, where we see structural growth coming from global wealth creation, vs a more muted outlook for European banks,"" the analyst said. — Lisa Kailai Han 5:41 a.m.: Deutsche Bank initiates Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Li Auto as buy Li Auto looks primed to capitalize on the growing Chinese electric vehicle market, according to Deutsche Bank. The bank initiated coverage of the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer at a buy rating. Analyst Bin Wang cited the company's market positioning as one of its greatest catalysts and called it a top pick. ""Li Auto is the largest 6 / 7 seater vehicles manufacturer in China with a 13.8% market share in 2023, which is the sweet spot of the automobile electrification mega-trend in China,"" he wrote. Wang noted that the firm is slated to enter the pure electric vehicle market this month with the Mega MPV, its new flagship vehicle. Li Auto also plans to strengthen its position as the second-largest plug-in hybrid electric vehicle maker through the launch of its L6 large-size SUV next month. Li Auto is also emerging as an industry leader in the AI-powered autonomous driving field, Wang added. Additionally, the company had the highest gross margin among China new energy vehicle manufacturers, with the figure coming out to 21.2% in the first half of last year. ""This is a result of Li Auto garnering a higher average selling price (ASP) from its 6 / 7 seater vehicle segment exposure and best-of-breed execution efficiency, which leads to a lower-per-unit fixed cost than peers,"" Wang said. U.S.-listed shares of Li Auto have slipped close to 3% this year. — Lisa Kailai Han 5:41 a.m.: JPMorgan upgrades GE to overweight General Electric has been on a roll recently, and JPMorgan expects the outperformance to continue. The bank upgraded the conglomerate to overweight from neutral. It also hiked its price target to $180 from $166, implying upside of 13%. ""It is clear that GE is the premier large cap name in Comml Aero with regard to 1) the business, 2) where that business is in the cycle, 3) the balance sheet, and 4) the mgmt team,"" analyst Seth Seifman wrote. ""Some of this is priced in and valuation is an obstacle ... but it is the only obstacle for us right now and with upside remaining, we think the companys fundamental strength wins out,"" Seifman added. ""Vernova looks promising as well based on rebounding margins and cash flow, as well as diversified exposure to the long-term energy transition.""

Here's what else to expect,"A model of Comac's C919 aircraft at the Singapore Airshow on Feb. 6, 2018. SeongJoon Cho / Bloomberg / Getty Images

SINGAPORE — China is gearing up to showcase its narrow-body passenger jet to a global audience for the first time at the Singapore Airshow. Touted as a competitor to Boeing's 737 and the Airbus 320, the Comac C919 is quickly turning out to be one of the most anticipated features at this year's event. The commercial aircraft was developed by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or Comac, and certified by the Civil Aviation Administration of China in September 2022. ""Flying for the first time at the Singapore Airshow, is the C919, a narrow-body airliner developed by Chinese aircraft manufacturer Comac,"" Singapore Airshow organizer and manager Experia Events said in a statement. The air show, held from Feb. 20 to 25 this year, is typically attended by tens of thousands, including military delegations and aviation enthusiasts, and will be open to the public. Aerospace and aviation industry bellwethers including Airbus , Boeing , Comac and defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin , Dassault , SAAB , Leonardo , Thales are among those participating at this year's event.

""Generally what to look for is a focus on China with the C919 making its international debut. The Singapore Airshow is a fantastic opportunity for Comac particularly given the current situation with Boeing,"" Brendan Sobie of Sobie Aviation told CNBC. Sobie noted that this year's air show could be significant as it can be seen as ""a symbol of Asia's recovery.""

Aerial acrobatics and more

The Singapore Airshow will feature the largest number of foreign flying teams this year, according to organizer Experia. The first edition of the exhibition, one of Asia's biggest aerospace events, was first held in 2008. The Indian Air Force's Sarang aerial display team, which flies modified helicopters, will be performing aerial acrobatics. Others include the Royal Australian Air Force's Roulettes, the Indonesian Air Force's Jupiter and the Republic of Korea Air Force's Black Eagles. The United States Air Force's B-52 Stratofortress will make a flypast on Feb. 22, according to the organizer. Among commercial aircrafts, Airbus will be showcasing its large widebody A350-1000 model at the air show. The French manufacturer will also have static displays of helicopters, military aircraft as well as its wide-body commercial jet, the A330neo. Its key rival Boeing will not be featuring any passenger jets at the air show. There won't be many announcements of big commercial plane orders by airlines this year, as the focus will mostly be on defense aviation and private jets, analysts told CNBC. ""On a global level, the gap with the Dubai Airshow, which has really grown and become big for order announcements, has widened over the last several years, thwarting Singapore's earlier aspirations to become the third major global show after Paris and Farnborough,"" Sobie told CNBC. The event will also host private jet makers including Cessna maker Textron , Gulfstream, Jet Aviation. It will also feature ""advanced air mobility,"" an emerging mode of air transportation which can be in the form of air taxi services, cargo delivery, medical and emergency response transportation and private vehicles. Air taxis are small planes that can land and take off vertically, and are mostly used for short distances. Companies such as Hyundai-owned Supernal, Boeing-owned Wisk and Beta Technologies will be among those featuring their flying taxis.

Here is Jim Cramer's remedy,"Every weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer releases the Homestretch — an actionable afternoon update, just in time for the last hour of trading on Wall Street. (We're no longer recording the audio, so we can get this new written feature to members as quickly as possible.) Markets drop: There was another attempt to lift the market at the beginning of Friday's session, but it failed once again, putting the S & P 500 on track for a six-day losing streak. We keep pointing out that the rallies are happening too early in the session, leading the initial buyers to get caught by scalpers looking to make a quick trade. Volatile markets like this are when patience matters. We're still waiting for that truly ugly open before stepping up our buys. Until we see that crescendo, the oversold market means stay opportunistic but be gradual. That's been our approach this week, with our most-recent trade being a small buy of Estee Lauder on Thursday morning. Bad week for tech : Tech is getting hit hard again Friday, capping off a week in which the Nasdaq 100 fell by more than 5%. The biggest drag in the sector, by far, is Super Micro Computer . Shares of the artificial intelligence server maker were down as much as 20% Friday for a reason you don't see too often: The company hasn't preannounced earnings yet. Super Micro's stock has been one of the biggest winners in the market over the past couple of years due to the rapid construction of data centers around the world. Heavy investments in AI accelerated this trend. As demand for its rack-scale solutions and liquid-cooled systems surged, Super Micro's quarters kept getting better and better, resulting in earnings preannouncements in seven of the past eight quarters, including in January. Last month, the stock was added to the S & P 500. Entering this week, Super Micro was up more than 200% year to date. With earnings getting close on April 30, the fact Super Micro has yet to give a positive preannouncement is being viewed as negative, according to analysts at Wells Fargo. That doesn't mean Super Micro's quarter won't be good — we can't possibly know. But the recent fall in SMCI on no actual announcement is a reminder of a lesson that we shared earlier this year when markets were steadily making new highs: Always be fearful of parabolic moves and make sure you are taking gains on the way up because those kinds of moves are unstainable. Pockets of green: It's not all negative Friday. There's some pretty good strength in energy stocks, financials, consumer staples, health care, and real estate — a sign of money rotating out of hot momentum names and into other areas in the market. Shares of Club holding Coterra Energy rose nearly 2% on Friday, among the best performers in the portfolio. Do the work: Wells Fargo made a new 52-week high Friday, extending its weekly gains to more than 7%. Wells Fargo's strength follows a negative reaction to its first-quarter earnings report last week , even though the results were quite good. That's a theme we've noticed so far this earnings season. There's so much information coming out that sometimes the market gets sloppy and focuses on the wrong things, leading to misread results and ridiculous stock reactions. Fellow Club holdings Constellation Brands and Abbott Laboratories belong in this group, too. The lesson? Don't let the tape be the judge of a quarter. Instead, read the earnings materials and conference calls yourself because doing the work will help you spot opportunities. ""It's important to have confidence in investing. But confidence comes from doing the homework,"" Jim Cramer said Friday. Next week: Rest up over the weekend for an earnings barrage. Roughly 30% of the S & P 500 and 11 Dow components report earnings next week. Among the headliners are a trio of portfolio stocks — Alphabet , Microsoft and Meta Platforms — and beaten-up Tesla . But there are plenty of other big reports to sink our teeth into. Club holdings Danaher , Ford Motor , and Honeywell International are scheduled to report along with Verizon , Cadence Design , Nucor , UPS , GE Aerospace , PepsiCo, RTX , Halliburton , Thermo Fisher Scientific , ServiceNow and Chipotle , among others.

To determine the best car insurance companies in Texas, CNBC Select analyzed several insurance companies offering car insurance coverage in the state.

We focused on premiums for a single male driver who: Is 30 years old

Drives 18,000 miles per year, mostly for work

Has no violations or accidents on their record

548,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/10/india-boycott-of-maldives-may-cost-country-millions-in-tourism-dollars.html,TRV,Travelers Companies (The),"Social media uproar may cost the Maldives millions, as feud with India intensifies","Social media posts by Maldivian officials may cost the country millions in tourism revenue, as calls by Indian travelers to boycott the island nation intensify.

""We are seeing a 40% drop in bookings over the last two days,"" Ankit Chaturvedi, vice president and global head of marketing at the India-based travel software company Rategain, said Tuesday.

""Most people book on weekends, and therefore the drop seems more significant because ideally [bookings] should have gone up,"" he told CNBC Travel.

Travel bookings to the Maldives tumbled following a diplomatic row that erupted last week after a series of posts appeared on X, formerly known as Twitter, on India Prime Minister Narendra Modi's account.

The posts showed him snorkeling, sitting by the water and meeting people in Lakshadweep, which some viewed as a veiled attempt to siphon visitors away from the island nation.

Amid reports that thousands of Indian travelers have canceled trips to the Maldives, one prominent Indian travel booking website, EaseMyTrip, announced it is suspending flight bookings from India to the Maldives.

Some travel agents in India say they are canceling bookings to the Maldives, scrubbing their websites of its photos, and recommending travelers go to the Indian archipelago of Lakshadweep, the Andaman Islands, Nicobar Islands or Sri Lanka instead, according to The India Express.

The dispute has thrust a global spotlight on the little-known Lakshadweep, which like the Maldives, is a scenic chain of sandy atolls, coral reefs and crystalline water.

The Maldives, located some 340 miles to the south, is the preferred playground for India, however. In 2023, more than one in 10 arrivals were from India, making it the country's largest source market, followed by Russia and China, according to Maldives tourism statistics.

But more British travelers — and nearly twice as many Italians — have visited the Maldives in the first week of January, compared to those from India, which fell to fourth place in terms of visitor arrivals.",1/10/2024,1,0.076649733,0.005536141,0.000857117,0.913442969,0.002899099,0.000614913

Japan's Aozora Bank became the second lender in a span of hours to surprise investors with losses tied to US commercial property, sending shares down by the limit and heightening concern over global banks' exposure to souring real estate bets.

The bank's Tokyo-listed shares fell for a second day, tracking losses in U.S. regional lenders overnight.

Aozora, which had earlier forecast a profit, saw its shares plunge by as much as 18.5% to their lowest levels since February 2021 in early Friday Tokyo trade — the Nikkei 225 benchmark was up 0.5%.

Aozora Bank shares hit near three-year lows Friday, as investors continued to hammer the Japanese commercial lender after it downgraded its annual outlook to a loss on bad U.S. commercial real estate loans.

The commercial lender said Thursday it expects to post a net loss of 28 billion Japanese yen ($191 million) for the fiscal year ending March 31, compared with its previous outlook for a net profit of 24 billion yen. The bank forecast a net profit of 17 billion yen for the next fiscal year.

""Aozora is a major mid-tier lender whose strength lies in its relationships with real estate/business revitalization financing companies and regional financial institutions,"" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a Friday note.

They retained their sell rating on Aozora's shares with a price target of about 2,460 yen per share, mainly due to the short to medium outlook for the bank's profits.

Aozora said Thursday it expects its Common Equity Tier 1 ratio, which compares a bank's capital against its assets, to fall to 6.6% by the end of the current fiscal year, temporarily dipping below its 7% target.

""There have been some concerns in recent years over a decline in the CET1 ratio due to deterioration in U.S. commercial real estate credit costs and valuation losses on available-for-sale securities,"" Masahiko Sato, a senior analyst with SMBC Nikko Securities, wrote in a Thursday note to clients.

""How this will impact other banks is another question,"" Sato added. ""U.S. real estate lending for around 10% of (its) total lending with a CET1 ratio of below 7% due to unrealized losses on securities has no precedent.""

Aozora's update came shortly after U.S. regional bank New York Community Bancorp announced a surprise net loss of $252 million for the fourth quarter.

NYCB also slashed its dividend and said it had ""[built] reserves during the quarter to address weakness in the office sector"" — renewing some fears over the strength of U.S. regional banks, which were embroiled in a liquidity crisis last year.

The lender said this was in response to its purchase of the assets of Signature Bank, one of the regional banks that collapsed in last year's crisis. That purchase raised their total assets to $100 billion, placing them in a category that subjects the bank to more stringent liquidity standards.

Bank of America analysts said in a Wednesday note that the sell-off in U.S. regional banking shares on contagion fears is ""likely overdone given idiosyncratic factors tied to NYCB.""

""However, higher losses tied to commercial real estate office exposure, increase in criticized loans tied to multi-family CRE [commercial real estate] are a reminder of ongoing credit normalization that we are likely to witness across the industry,"" Bank of America U.S. banking analysts wrote.

""It is worth pointing out that the credit/liquidity build at NYCB are mostly the bank playing catch-up to actions taken by larger regional peers over the last year,"" they added.

So far, more than 14% of S & P 500 companies have reported. Of those companies, 73.6% have beaten earnings expectations, FactSet data shows. Here's a look at some of the biggest reports of the week and what analysts think — along with a look at potential implications for the broader market. Investment banks doing well, BofA not so much The major banks that posted results this week — Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and Bank of America — beat earnings expectations. Nonetheless, that didn't translate into a positive stock reaction for all three of them. Bank of America shares fell more than 3% despite the company beating on both top and bottom lines. Net interest income, a key metric of how much money a bank makes from loans, was $14.19 billion, above the $13.93 billion StreetAccount estimate. However, net interest income was lower on a yearly basis. Finance chief Alastair Borthwick also told analysts during a post-earnings conference call that net interest income will likely decline in the second quarter due to drops in wealth management, before potentially rebounding later in 2024. To be sure, Wells Fargo's Mike Mayo said Bank of America's first-quarter results were ""not too surprising"" and benefited from improved capital market conditions. He remains confident in the bank's reputation, deposits and credit quality in relation to its big bank peers. ""Overall, BAC is a Goliath at a time when Goliath is winning,"" Mayo wrote in a Tuesday note. Mayo has an overweight rating on Bank of America. BAC 5D mountain BAC 5-day chart Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley shares climbed around 3% and 2.5% each following their earnings announcements. For the week, they are up 3.7% and 6%, respectively. Analysts from JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo all raised their price targets on Goldman following its positive results. Wells Fargo's Mayo said the firm is ""likely best-of-breed"" among its peers. The bank's pivot away from commercial banking into a renewed emphasis on its asset and wealth management segments is a positive for Goldman, per Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala. He named Goldman as one of the best names to own thanks to its exposure to a broader uptick in investment banking activity, as well as secular trends including more financing opportunities for artificial intelligence projects and a growth in private credit. Mayo prefers Goldman over Morgan Stanley, for which he holds an equal weight rating on shares. The company posted a growth in wealth inflows and revenue. However, Mayo remains concerned about the flat NII in the wealth segment, keeping him on the sidelines. UnitedHealth crushes estimates, but cyberattack still an overhang UnitedHealth's results easily exceeded analyst expectations, sending shares soaring more than 14%. That would be its biggest weekly gain since April 2020, when it rallied 15%. However, management noted the ongoing fallout of the cyberattack on its subsidiary Change Healthcare will result in an impact on full-year earnings of between $1.15 and $1.35 per share. ""So while core MLR [medical loss ratio] in Q1 was slightly higher than expected, the outlook for the year seems largely inline with expectations, alleviating investor concerns around runaway medical cost trends and the risk from that to EPS,"" Deutsche analyst George Hill said in a Thursday note. He reiterated his buy rating on the stock, and slightly increased his price target to $562 from $545. UNH 5D mountain UNH 5-day chart Netflix concerns Netflix had a strong start to 2024 across the board, but its weaker-than-expected full-year revenue outlook weighed on sentiment. The streaming service also announced it would stop reporting quarterly subscriber numbers — a key metric watched by traders ahead of the report — and average revenue per membership starting next year. Shares fell on Friday more than 8% and were headed for their worst day since July 2023. ""Overall, NFLX's 1Q was very clean, but we'd expect pushback from the 2024 revenue growth outlook, ongoing concerns about slowdown of Paid Sharing benefits & advertising monetization, & valuation,"" JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth wrote in a Friday note. He reiterated his overweight rating and $650 price target on shares. Bank of America also remains bullish on shares. Analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich kept her buy rating and $700 price target, which she said is supported by its increased visibility in growth drivers and strength in innovation. Not all firms were as optimistic, however. Goldman Sachs retained its neutral rating on the stock, while Canaccord Genuity downgraded shares to hold from buy on slower forecasted growth. The reduced subscriber disclosures ""add to uncertainty,"" the firm said. Mixed earnings picture Although nearly three-quarters of the reported earnings so far have topped expectations, the broader picture is more muddled. Profit growth is on track to disappoint, according to FactSet data. The blended earnings growth rate, which considers the reports already out and the estimates from those still pending, sits at just 0.16%. Analysts expected year-over-year profit expansion of more than 3% heading into the season, per FactSet.

Monzo raised the money in a new funding round led by CapitalG, the independent venture arm of Google parent company Alphabet .

HongShan, the Chinese venture capital firm that split from Sequoia Capital last year, also backed the round, alongside existing backers Tencent and Passion Capital.

Monzo, which is one of the U.K.'s most popular app-only banks, said the fresh cash would be used to accelerate its expansion plans. The bank's CEO, TS Anil, told the Financial Times the capital would allow Monzo to crack the U.S. market after its previous foray was curtailed by U.S. regulators.

""With backing from global investors, we have the rocket fuel to go after our ambitions harder and faster, building Monzo into the one app that sits at the centre of our customers' financial lives,"" Monzo CEO TS Anil said in a statement.

The Indian central bank's key interest rate was kept unchanged for a seventh straight policy meeting on Friday as growth in the economy is expected to remain robust while inflation stays above the 4% target. The six-member monetary policy committee kept the main lending rate at 6.5%, in line with expectations. The repo rate was raised by a total of 250 basis points between May 2022 and February 2023. ""Robust growth prospects provide the policy space to remain focused on inflation and ensure its descent to the target of 4%,"" RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said in his prepared statement. Monetary policy must remain actively disinflationary at this stage, Das said. Inflation was the ""elephant in the room"" for the Indian economy two years ago, Das said.

""The elephant has now gone out for a walk and appears to be returning to the forest. We would like the elephant to return to the forest and remain there on a durable basis."" But Das flagged that food price volatility remains a concern, although core inflation has fallen sharply in recent months to below 4%. ""While low core inflation provides comfort, the uncertainty on food inflation remains a worry,"" said Upasna Bhardwaj, chief economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank. ""We do not see much scope for any rate easing until the second quarter of 2024-25,"" she said, referring to the July-September quarter this year. Five out of six members of the rate setting committee voted in favor of the rate decision while the monetary policy stance of 'withdrawal of accommodation' was retained with a majority of five votes. The status quo policy left markets unmoved.

The Indian rupee INR=IN gained slightly against the U.S. dollar at 83.4050, just above a record low hit on Thursday, while bond yields were unchanged at 7.10%. The NSE Nifty 50 .NSEI index as well as the BSE Sensex .BSESN traded flat. The central bank said the Indian economy is expected to expand by 7% in the fiscal year 2025, which began on April 1, unchanged from its earlier forecast. Strengthening rural demand, improving employment conditions, moderating inflation pressures and a sustained pick up in the manufacturing and services sectors should boost consumer demand, Das said. India's GDP growth is seen at 7.6% in the year ended March 31, 2024, but consumption, which forms nearly 60% of the economy, is likely to grow at just 3% - the lowest in two decades barring the pandemic period. ""We expect monetary easing either through a rate cut or change in stance to begin from October 2024,"" said Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist at India Ratings & Research.

But he added that the economy's strong growth momentum may limit rate cuts in this cycle to 50 to 75 basis points. Retail inflation for 2024-25 is seen at 4.5%, Das said. The committee believes that durable price stability would set strong foundations for a period of high growth, it said. However volatile food prices could change the outlook. ""The increasing incidence of climate shocks remains a key upside risk to food prices,"" the rate setting panel said in its monetary policy statement. India is likely to experience more heat-wave days than normal between April and June, the country's weather office said earlier this week.

The rise in power demand for data centers — which are booming from the need to support a new world of AI technologies — is also fueling demand for the providers of data center parts. According to the firm, that includes power producers, grid equipment makers, providers of grid technology, as well as commodity companies tied to uranium and copper, used for cabling and electricity network serving the data center. ""Expected power usage for U.S. data centers under construction is equivalent to more than 50% of the power currently used by U.S. data centers. Several years out, even after these data centers are constructed, some expect data center power consumption to double again,"" analyst Thomas Thornton wrote in a Wednesday note. ""Demand continues to remain robust for 'traditional' data center space, pricing power is real, and AI demand remains in its early innings,"" Thornton said, noting that AI workloads' power usage is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of between 25% and 33% between 2023 and 2028. He added that AI processing tends to happen on graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are more power intensive, and that the power consumption of GPUs themselves has been increasing — favoring newer data centers designed for AI. According to Bank of America analysts, several companies stand to benefit from the rapidly growing power needs of data centers, including Caterpillar and Equinix. Take a look at the buy-rated names below: Caterpillar is an ""underrated"" play in this theme, as it has a deep legacy of providing engines for back-up power generation, according to the firm. Analysts pointed out that data centers continue to be a bright spot in Caterpillar's earnings even as other end markets slow down, as its power generation unit has outpaced the company's overall growth in the past four quarters. The company is a leading manufacturer of diesel generator sets with more than 450,000 kilowatts installed in data centers and hospitals in a single year, the firm said. Management is raising its own capital expenditures for the first time in a decade to meet the power demand for data centers, BofA added. Caterpillar stock has 7.6% potential upside, according to BofA's price target of $385. Shares have added nearly 20% this year, but are down 3% over the past week. Buy-rated REITs Digital Realty Trust and Equinix are ""starting to capture the very early beginnings of AI demand, but ... the vast majority of the total opportunity is yet to come,"" according to analyst David Barden. Both companies are anticipating strong top-line revenue growth this year, but the companies diverge when it comes to their bottom line, or net income. ""Strong bottom-line growth at EQIX underpins our Top Pick thesis, while DLR is more of a 'show me story' in this respect. DLR has long been a slower growth story than EQIX due to dilutive M & A, equity issuance, etc,"" Barden said in the note. ""This said, investors have shown they are able to look past this in anticipation of better growth in the future given top-line trends."" BofA anticipates shares of Digital Realty and Equinix to jump roughly 24% and 33%, respectively. Digital Realty shares are up 1.7% this year, while Equinix has slumped 7.1%. Software company Aspen Tech and electrical components maker Eaton are a couple other companies BofA is bullish on when it comes to data center infrastructure and power suppliers. The firm thinks Eaton shares could climb another 12.2% after gaining more than 25% this year, saying ""we argue a premium valuation is warranted due to expected upside from cyclical operating leverage, strong margin performance, and Eaton's less cyclical portfolio mix."" Other beneficiaries, from both the growth of data centers and associated power needs, that were mentioned by BofA analysts include energy companies such as Constellation Energy and Dominion Energy . To be sure, analysts mentioned that data center demand will likely exceed supply. As the demand for generative AI piles onto otherwise traditional data center demand, AI-related demand will emerge in two phases — training and inference — where training new AI models will require power and cooling while new data centers will need to be built to accommodate those needs, they said.",4/20/2024,0,0.002095175,0.990753293,0.000786718,0.004081002,0.00146497,0.00081887

Market watchers are expecting the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in June.

The key Fed inflation gauge for February climbed 2.8% year on year, according to data released Friday — likely to keep the U.S. central bank on hold before it can start considering rate cuts.

The dollar drifted higher on Thursday as a mixed batch of U.S. data did little to shake views that the economy is still on solid ground, suggesting the Federal Reserve will likely delay the timing of its first rate cut since 2020 to later this year.

Comments from New York Fed President John Williams saying he does not ""feel the urgency to cut interest rates,"" given the strength of the economy also helped lift the dollar. The New York Fed president is always a voter on the central bank's policy-setting committee.

A warning by the finance chiefs of the United States, Japan and Korea over the sharp decline in other currencies weighed on the dollar overnight and offered the yen some rare respite. But the impact has since dissipated.

The yen had risen modestly on Wednesday after Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda said finance leaders of the G7 reaffirmed their stance that excessive currency volatility was undesirable.

But strong U.S. economic data and persistent inflation have prompted investors to drastically rethink the chances of the Federal Reserve cutting rates any time soon. On Thursday, that strength was on display once again.

Manufacturing activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region expanded by the most in two years in April on the strength of new orders and shipments of finished goods, although factory employment continued to fall.

The Philadelphia Fed's monthly business conditions index rose to 15.5 from 3.2 in March, exceeding the median estimate among economists in a Reuters poll for a reading of 2.3 and overshooting even the most optimistic forecast among 34 economists surveyed.

""You saw the pullback yesterday and now the dollar is firmer. This goes to show that people are buying on dips and so sentiment has not changed,"" said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist, at Bannockburn Forex in New York. ""We saw the Philadelphia Fed survey, which came out stronger than expected. So the market is still making an adjustment toward what looks like an re-acceleration of the economy,"" he added.

Other economic reports were neutral to weak. U.S. initial jobless claims were unchanged at a seasonally adjusted 212,000 for the week ended April 13, data showed, still higher than the forecast of 215,000. Claims have been bouncing around in a 194,000-225,000 range this year.

In the housing sector, U.S. existing home sales fell in March as higher interest rates and house prices sidelined buyers. Home sales dropped 4.3% last month to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 4.19 million units.

The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six others, was up 0.2% at 106.16, still within reach of this week's 5-1/2-month high of 106.51 hit on Tuesday. The index was so far up 4.5% this year.

The Japanese currency slipped against the dollar, pushing the greenback up 0.1% at 154.64 yen, within sight of Tuesday's 34-year low of 154.79.

Market participants have raised the bar on possible intervention by Japanese authorities to prop up the yen, now pinpointing the 155 level even though they believe Japan could step in at any time. Still, given the dollar's broad strength, Wei Liang Chang, a currency and credit strategist at DBS, said their models suggest the risk of intervention may even have shifted to the 156 range, as Japanese authorities consider the yen's performance against a handful of other currencies that have depreciated.

In other currencies, the euro dipped 0.1% against the dollar to $1.0661 after Wednesday's gain, pulling away from a five-month low touched on Tuesday. Sterling was last flat at $1.2452.

Markets are pricing about 39 basis of Fed cuts for 2024, compared with an expectation of around six quarter-point easing at the start of the year. Traders see September as the most likely starting point, versus June just a couple of weeks ago, based on the CME FedWatch Tool.

Oil prices rose in early Asian trade on Thursday on concerns of lower supply as major producers are keeping output cuts in place and on signs of stronger economic growth in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer.

Brent futures for June rose 15 cents, or 0.2%, to settle at $89.51 a barrel at 0037 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures for May rose 15 cents, or 0.2%, to $85.59 a barrel.

Both the June Brent contract and the May WTI contract have risen for the past four days and closed on Wednesday at the highest since the end of October.

Oil has gained as Ukraine's attacks on Russian refineries have cut fuel supply and amid concerns that the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza may spread to include Iran, possibly disrupting supplies in the key Middle East region.

A meeting of top ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and its allies including Russia, kept oil supply policy unchanged on Wednesday and pressed some countries to boost compliance with output cuts.

The group said some members would compensate for oversupply in the first quarter. It also said Russia would switch to output rather than export curbs.

Also on Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was cautious about future interest rate cuts because of recent data showing higher-than-expected job growth and inflation.

The comments were positive for oil because they indicated solid U.S. economic growth, said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist for U.S. Bank's asset management group.

Who's this for? If you are looking for a broad network of ATMs to avoid any out-of-network fees and want a chance to earn a slightly higher APY, consider the savings accounts offered by Chase. Chase Bank has nearly 4,900 branches and 16,000 ATMs. Like Wells Fargo, Chase offers two brick-and-mortar savings accounts: the standard Chase Savings℠ and the Chase Premier Savings℠. CNBC Select ranked the latter as one of the best because you can earn better interest rates (what Chase calls ""relationship rates"") on higher balances by linking your savings to a Chase Premier Plus Checking℠ or Chase Sapphire℠ Checking and making at least five transactions in a month using your linked checking account. If you don't link your Chase Premier Savings account to a Chase checking account, the APY is 0.01%. But the APY creeps up slightly if you do have a linked account. For example, you can earn 0.02% APY if you also have a Premier Plus Checking or Chase Sapphire Checking account. By linking to a checking account, you also avoid the monthly $25 service fee that comes with the Chase Premier Savings. Otherwise, there's a daily minimum balance of $15,000 required. There is no minimum deposit required to open an account. If you choose to link a Chase Sapphire Checking account, you can take advantage of Sapphire℠ Banking perks, which include special access to sports and entertainment events and early ticket sales. Chase also has an automatic savings program where customers can get help reaching their set savings goals in the bank's mobile app. There is a $5 savings withdrawal limit fee when you make over six withdrawals in a month, including those made at a branch or at an ATM. This fee is waived with a balance of $15,000 or more in the account at the time of withdrawal.

Potential savers can open an account with a $25 minimum deposit. The monthly maintenance fee is $4 a month. The fee is waived for account holders who have a $300 minimum daily balance, a $1,000 average monthly collected balance or are under 18.

There is no minimum deposit required to open an account. Customers can avoid paying the low monthly fee by maintaining a minimum daily balance of at least $500 or linking their savings account to their checking account and either making one enhanced direct deposit and one qualifying bill payment per statement period or maintaining a $1,500 average monthly collected balance.

Who's this for? PNC Bank is a large brick-and-mortar bank with approximately 2,300 branch locations and nearly 18,000 PNC and PNC Partner ATMs. It stands out on our list for its savings account option called Virtual Wallet®, which uses innovative online tools to make it easy to see how you're managing your money day to day. The account is best for those who want to do all their banking in one place as it rewards you for combining your savings and checking into one. New account holders can earn a welcome bonus of up to $400 depending on what type of Virtual Wallet they open. The three choices include Virtual Wallet, Virtual Wallet with Performance Spend and Virtual Wallet with Performance Select. The simple Virtual Wallet has basic account features while the two other options offer more premium rewards. For those enrolled in school, there is also a Virtual Wallet Student option. All of the above Virtual Wallet options include individual accounts that work together: Spend, Reserve and Growth. Spend is your everyday checking account, Reserve your interest-bearing checking account / primary overdraft protection account and Growth is your long-term savings account / secondary overdraft protection account. Higher ""relationship"" interest rates are available on your Growth savings account. The monthly service charges range from $7 to $25, depending on the type of Virtual Wallet you have and can be waived depending on minimum balances in your Spend + Reserve checking accounts (required balances and minimum deposits vary according to the type of Virtual Wallet you have). Virtual Wallet account holders can make free transactions at approximately 9,000 PNC-owned ATMs, and if you end up using a non-PNC ATM, some fees are reimbursed. Through the PNC Purchase Payback® program, customers can also earn cash back or points on purchases made using their PNC Bank Visa® Debit Card which is automatically issued when they sign up for Virtual Wallet. The customized rewards program has offers available from participating merchants depending on your shopping habits. Though you can open a Virtual Wallet account online, being a brick-and-mortar bank, PNC also welcomes customers to visit their local branch to open an account and offers a coupon printout of the welcome bonus that savers can bring with them to redeem. For current APY information, call 1-888-PNC-BANK (1-888-762-2265). If you're looking for a more straightforward account, PNC Bank also offers a Standard Savings Account.

Why trust CNBC Select?

At CNBC Select, our mission is to provide our readers with high-quality service journalism and comprehensive consumer advice so they can make informed decisions with their money. Every brick-and-mortar savings account review is based on rigorous reporting by our team of expert writers and editors with extensive knowledge of banking products. While CNBC Select earns a commission from affiliate partners on many offers and links, we create all our content without input from our commercial team or any outside third parties, and we pride ourselves on our journalistic standards and ethics. See our methodology for more information on how we choose the best big bank savings accounts.

Our methodology

To determine which big bank savings accounts are best, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of U.S. savings accounts offered by the largest national banks and credit unions. We narrowed down our ranking by only considering those savings accounts that come from big banks with broad availability, offering access to at least 700 physical branches and over 4,000 non-fee ATMs in the U.S. While the accounts we chose in this article are from the largest banks, we compared each savings account on a range of features, including its fees, opportunities to earn higher interest rates, customer service and any other special offerings or programs. We also considered factors such as insurance policies, users' deposit options, other savings accounts being offered by the same bank and customer reviews when available. All of the accounts included on this list are FDIC-insured up to $250,000. Note that the interest rates and fee structures for brick-and-mortar savings accounts are subject to change without notice. Product and feature availability vary by market so they may not be offered depending on where you live. Most brick-and-mortar banks require you to enter your zip code online for the correct account offerings. Any return on your savings depends on the associated fees and the balance you have in your brick-and-mortar savings account. To open a savings account, most banks and institutions require a deposit of new money, meaning you can't transfer money you already had in an account at that bank.

561,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/13/healthy-returns-higher-medical-costs-are-pinching-cvs-unitedhealth.html,UNH,UnitedHealth Group,Healthy Returns: Higher medical costs are pinching insurers,"Good afternoon! Health insurers are feeling the squeeze as older patients head to the doctor more than expected.

CVS, which owns health insurer Aetna, on Wednesday slashed its full-year profit outlook, citing the potential for higher medical costs to bite into its profits. That warning came two weeks after insurance giant Humana cited the same factor as it issued a dismal 2024 earnings guidance.

Medical costs from Medicare Advantage patients have spiked over the last year as more older adults return to hospitals to undergo procedures they had delayed during the Covid pandemic, such as joint and hip replacements.

Medicare Advantage, a type of privately run health insurance plan contracted by Medicare, has long been a key source of growth and profits for the insurance industry. More than half of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in such plans, enticed by lower monthly premiums and extra benefits not covered by traditional Medicare, according to health policy research firm KFF.

But investors have become more concerned about the runaway costs, which insurance companies say may not come down anytime soon. Other companies in the Medicare Advantage space are UnitedHealth Group and Elevance Health.

CVS executives said on an earnings call Wednesday that the company's insurance division saw slightly higher rates of outpatient care, including hip and knee surgeries, in the fourth quarter. They also saw more use of supplemental benefits such as dental and vision care, and ""some pressure"" from RSV vaccinations.

The executives said inpatient care, or formal hospital admissions, was in line with the company's expectations for the period.

The insurance segment's medical benefit ratio — a measure of total medical expenses paid relative to premiums collected — increased to 88.5% for the fourth quarter from 85.8% during the year-ago period. A lower ratio typically indicates that the company collected more in premiums than it paid out in benefits, resulting in higher profitability.

Last month, Humana said it saw an even bigger jump in medical costs in the fourth quarter. The company said the increase came partly from higher outpatient activity, but the company largely blamed it on an unexpected increase in inpatient care in November and December.

That pushed its medical benefit ratio in its insurance segment to a whopping 91.4% for the quarter, up from 87.4% for the same period a year ago.

Higher medical costs may be a larger problem for Humana than they are for CVS and other insurers. That's because Humana is more dependent on its Medicare Advantage business than its rivals, as it accounts for more than 80% of its earnings, UBS analysts said in a Jan. 25 note.

They added that there is no other part of Humana's business that could meaningfully dampen the hit from higher medical costs on the insurance side. Humana has a specialty pharmacy segment called CenterWell, but it only brought in roughly a fifth of the revenue that the company's insurance division booked for the fourth quarter.

Meanwhile, CVS has a retail pharmacy business and a health services segment, both of which posted stronger-than-expected revenue for the quarter.

Another insurance giant that has been seeing higher medical costs, UnitedHealth Group, also has large health-care services and pharmacy operations that diversify its earnings streams.

The bigger question for all three companies is how exactly a new policy called the ""two-midnight rule"" will impact their insurance businesses.

Starting this year, Medicare Advantage plans have to cover their members' hospitalizations at the higher inpatient rate if their doctors predict they'll have to stay beyond two midnights. That policy has applied to traditional Medicare plans for nearly a decade.",2/13/2024,-2,0.978378534,0.001782281,0.00044058,0.017234707,0.001819228,0.00034461

Monday's declines come after the S & P 500 gained more than 1% last week and closed at a new all-time high. PANW surges: We added to our position in Palo Alto Networks Monday morning following our big push last week and at Saturday's Annual Meeting , and the stock has instantly rewarded those who caught it with a double-digit percent move at one point. We don't see any specific catalyst behind this surge, other than investors realizing its platformization strategy will accelerate market share gains. The recent cybersecurity attack on UnitedHealth Group-owned Change Healthcare was further proof that even the largest companies in the world are vulnerable to outside threats. With Monday's gains, Palo Alto Networks has recovered almost half of its post-earnings selloff. Alphabet struggles: But Google's parent company weighed on the portfolio, with shares down more than 4% at one point on concerns about its AI offerings. It always seems like Alphabet 's AI initiatives keep taking one step forward and two steps back, with the latest blunder involving image generation for its Gemini AI model, the company's answer to OpenAI's ChatGPT. In a note from Melius Research, analyst Ben Reitzes argued the stock at 21 times earnings is ""cheap for a reason."" Adds Jim Cramer: ""Ben Reitzes at Melius raises lots of negatives about Google that can be summed up as a lack of discipline, which is why it is the worst of the Super Six."" The Super Six are Amazon , Apple , Alphabet, Meta Platforms , Microsoft , and Nvidia . Wells Fargo speaks: Shares of Wells Fargo made a new 52-week high earlier before giving back its gains as part of the broader market dip. Still, the bank's shares fared much better than the broader financials sector Monday. The bank's CFO Michael Santomassimo spoke at the UBS Financial Services Conference, and one of his more closely watched updates was a reiteration of the company's outlook that net interest income will decline 7% to 9% in 2024. We think there's room for upside to this guide since it incorporates six rate cuts and it's highly likely we'll see less than that. However, Santomassimo reminded the room that there are a lot of factors that go into the guide. Quick hits: ""Broadcom is all about selling things they got with VMware that they don't need. This is just one,"" Cramer said. Broadcom struck a deal Monday to sell its End—User Computing division to KKR for $4 billion. ""Buffett's cash hoard may be a factor of an unwillingness to get involved in anything that's still down. I wonder if he is selling Apple right here"" Cramer added. ""His lack of discussion of it made me feel that's the case."" Later: The big earnings reports after the closing bell are Unity , Zoom Video , and Workday . One report before the opening bell on Tuesday that we'll be closely monitoring is Lowe's . While we already got a glimpse into the home improvement landscape last week with Home Depot , Lowe's will provide a slightly different view due to its higher exposure to the do-it-yourself (DIY) customer. ""Lowe's could be a catalyst that makes it worth buying Stanley Black & Decker with that yield protection,"" Jim said. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

563,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/21/walgreens-earns-a-unwanted-title-as-its-booted-from-the-dow-whats-behind-the-decision.html,UNH,UnitedHealth Group,Walgreens earns an unwanted title as it's booted from the Dow for Amazon. How it happened,"Well, that didn't last long. Walgreens has the dubious distinction of being one of the stocks that has had the shortest duration in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The announcement Tuesday that Amazon would replace Walgreens Boots Alliance in the 30-stock index on Monday following Walmart's decision to split its stock 3-for-1 was not entirely unexpected. At $22, Walgreens has the lowest stock price in the index, which traditionally would make it a target for replacement. And Amazon had been speculated to be an add for several years, following its decision in 2022 to split its stock 20-for-1 . Unclear criteria In case you're wondering, both the Dow Jones and S & P indexes have a committee that meets regularly to decide on any changes. What criteria do they use to add or delete a stock? It's pretty fuzzy. The Dow Jones Average Methodology paper says that, ""While stock selection is not governed by quantitative rules, a stock typically is added only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors."" That's pretty fuzzy. Even less clear: ""Changes to the indices are made on an as-needed basis,"" the methodology paper says. ""There is no annual or semi-annual reconstitution."" The criteria gets a big firmer here: ""Rather, changes in response to corporate actions and market developments can be made at any time."" There seems to be two issues that were sufficient ""changes in corporate actions"" that allowed the index committee to take action. First was price. Since the Dow indices are distinguished from the S & P indices because the Dow is price weighted, the price criteria gets a bit more specific. ""Since the indexes are price weighted, the Index Committee evaluates stock price when considering a company for inclusion. The Index Committee monitors whether the highest-priced stock in the index has a price more than 10 times that of the lowest,"" it says. That's interesting. Right now, the highest priced stock, UnitedHealth Group , is more than 23 times the value of the lowest priced stock, Walgreens. So it certainly seems like it's time to make a change. And the decision by Walmart to split its stock 3-for-1 would certainly make the index committee more comfortable adding Amazon, since the stock split would mean Walmart would have less weighting in the Dow and it would give the committee room to increase retail exposure. Sector representation is also a factor: ""Maintaining adequate sector representation within the index is also a consideration in the selection process for the Dow Jones Industrial Average,"" the methodology paper states. S & P made a nod to this requirement in its press release, saying that adding Amazon would reflect ""the evolving nature of the American economy,"" and that ""this change will increase consumer retail exposure as well as other business areas in the DJIA."" Walgreens' short tenure This is another in a string of setbacks for Walgreens. The stock was in the $60s when it was added to the Dow in 2018 . Removal after only six years would make Walgreens one of the companies with the shortest stay in the Dow Industrials. Though it is not stated explicitly, removing stocks after a short period in the indexes goes against the grain of the indexes. As they make clear, changes are made on an as-needed basis, and the Dow Industrials, at least, has always tried to keep change at the minimal. There has only been a little over 60 changes since 1896. WBA 5Y mountain Walgreens stock over the past five years To give you an idea of the aversion to change, there were no changes from March 1939 until July 1956. Index watchers have told me for years that to some degree you need a reason to be removed, compared to significantly larger justification to be put in. Having your stock trade for 23 times less than the highest priced stock in the index is certainly some justification. By the way, in case you're wondering, the record for shortest time in the Dow Industrials appears to be U.S. Rubber. That stock was in the Dow for six months in 1896, then was added back two years later – replacing General Electric. Talk about a convuluted history. In the early days, General Electric was an original in 1896. U.S Rubber replaced GE in 1898. GE was added back in 1899. It was taken out again in 1901. It was added back in 1907. And taken out again in 2018. Guess what replaced GE? Walgreens. Is Uber a transportation stock? Finally, one wonders how Uber executives feel about the decision to put them into the Dow Jones Transportation Index. Uber is replacing JetBlue , which like Walgreens in the Industrials, is now the cheapest stock in the Transports, at $7.01. CNBC's Robert Hum noted that the company specifically identifies as a tech company in its mission statement: ""We are a tech company that connects the physical and digital worlds to help make movement happen at the tap of a button."" S & P, of course, did not consult Uber prior to adding them. Still, the only other ""ground"" company in the Transports is Avis, which no one would argue is a ""tech"" company.",2/21/2024,-1,0.005944807,0.010110284,0.000558064,0.91763258,0.061999418,0.003754922

JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America are all slated to post their fourth-quarter results. UnitedHealth and Delta Airlines numbers are also on deck. Overall, S & P 500 earnings are expected to have grown by 1.3% during the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, according to FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters. That would be the second straight quarter of earnings expansion. However, Butters noted that analysts made ""larger cuts than average"" to earnings per share estimates heading into this reporting period. ""Given concerns in the market about a possible economic slowdown or recession, have analysts lowered EPS estimates more than normal for S & P 500 companies for the fourth quarter?"" Butters wrote Friday. ""The answer is yes."" Take a look at CNBC Pro's breakdown of what's expected from some of this week's key reports. Friday UnitedHealth is set to report earnings before the bell, with a conference call scheduled for 8:45 a.m. ET. Last quarter: UNH posted earnings and revenue that beat analyst expectations. The company also hiked its full-year guidance. This quarter: Analysts polled by LSEG expect UnitedHealth to report double-digit earnings and revenue growth from the year-earlier period. What CNBC is watching: UnitedHealth's stock posted its first annual loss in 15 years in 2023, losing 0.7%, while the S & P 500 soared more than 20%. Can the health insurance giant recover its mojo? The fourth-quarter may hold some clues. Specifically, investors will keep an eye on guidance around Medicare Advantage enrollment. Shares fell on Friday after CVS said it sees membership growing to at least 800,000 this year. That's up from a forecast for 600,000 additional members. What history shows: Bespoke Investment Group data shows UnitedHealth beats earnings expectations 93% of the time. Shares also average a 0.9% gain on earnings day. JPMorgan Chase is set to report earnings before the market opens. A call is also scheduled for 8:30 a.m. ET. Last quarter: JPM topped earnings expectations thanks to higher rates and lower credit costs. This quarter: JPMorgan earnings are expected to have fallen slightly year over year, but revenue is seen as growing by more than 10%, LSEG data shows. What CNBC banks reporter Hugh Son is watching: ""JPMorgan Chase distanced itself from its big bank peers last year, both in share performance and winning the First Republic auction. Investors who wonder if the party can continue will seek guidance on net interest income, expenses and loan losses for 2024."" What history shows: JPMorgan Chase beats earnings estimates 82% of the time, according to Bespoke. The stock has also risen in five straight earnings days. Citigroup is set to report earnings in the premarket. Management is slated to hold a call at noon ET. Last quarter: C posted revenue that beat estimates , boosted by strong growth in the bank's institutional client and personal banking businesses. This quarter: The bank's earnings are forecast to have dropped by more than 15% on a year-over-year basis, according to LSEG. What CNBC banks reporter Hugh Son is watching: ""The greatest scrutiny this quarter falls on Citigroup, which is in the middle of CEO Jane Fraser's corporate overhaul. Management has said it will disclose severance costs and job cuts along with fourth quarter earnings."" What history shows: Citigroup's stock typically struggles on earnings days, losing an average of 0.25%. Shares also fell in the last two earnings days. However, the bank beats earnings expectations 76% of the time, according to Bespoke. Delta Air Lines is set to report earnings before the bell, followed by a call at 10 a.m. ET. Last quarter: DAL reported a nearly 60% year-over-year profit jump , citing a strong summer travel season. This quarter: The airline is expected to report a sharp year-over-year earnings decline but also a 10% revenue increase, per LSEG. What CNBC CNBC airlines reporter Leslie Josephs is watching: ""Delta will be first out of the gate with U.S. airline earnings this quarter and we'll be looking for clues whether 2023's robust demand could continue to grow this year, or whether consumers are spent out after the last holiday season. Delta last month reiterated its earnings and revenue forecasts for the fourth quarter and the industry is coming off of a strong and smooth holiday season, so there might not be many surprises there. But executives will face questions about where costs — and fares cover them — are headed this year. Look for clues on Delta's growth and hiring plans for the spring and summer, when carriers make the bulk of their money and high-revenue international travel picks up."" What history shows: Bespoke data shows Delta beats earnings estimates 68% of the time. However, shares have fallen on the last four earnings days. Bank of America is set to report earnings in the premarket, with a call slated for 11 a.m. ET. Last quarter: BAC earnings beat expectations thanks to strong interest income . This quarter: LSEG data shows analysts see a 21% year-over-year drop in earnings. What CNBC banks reporter Hugh Son is watching: ""For Bank of America, the biggest questions remain its exposure to underwater bonds purchased when interest rates were low. A related question is what to expect from net interest income and expenses this year."" What history shows: Bank of America beats earnings estimates 79% of the time, per Bespoke. The stock rose after the last nine reports were released.",1/7/2024,-2,0.010456773,0.926676452,0.002414772,0.030927319,0.027677203,0.001847605
565,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/27/quality-stocks-are-dominating-the-market-up-25percent-in-the-past-year.html,UNH,UnitedHealth Group,"Quality stocks are dominating the market, up 25% in the past year","Investors have grown a bit snobbish, insisting on buying the highest quality and willing to pay up lavishly to own and flaunt the best. Among the most broadly played investment ""factors"" — including value, momentum, low volatility, dividend yield — quality has dominated the market, the representative iShares MSCI USA Quality ETF (QUAL) up 25% in the past year, compared to 13% for S & P 500 value and less than 5% for the equal-weighted S & P 500. Even within industry sectors, the stocks with higher quality scores have sped ahead ( Costco in retail, WW Grainger in industrials, etc.). The quality label is based on strong balance sheets, high and steady profit margins, consistency of earnings growth and the like. The category is adjacent to and inclusive of the small group of enormous growth stocks that have led the market for a year, but it's more than just the giants of the Nasdaq. Yes, Nvidia , Microsoft and Apple are top holdings in the QUAL ETF (and numerous similar ones) but so are Visa , Mastercard , Nike and UnitedHealth . As this flavor of stock has gained favor, the S & P 500 itself has taken on more of a quality character over time, something that strategists at Bank of America and Citi have been noting for a while, as they argue index earnings are less cyclical than decades ago and perhaps deserve a higher valuation than used to be the norm. Over the past five years, note the QUAL ETF has been almost indistinguishable from the S & P 500 and from Berkshire Hathaway, a company that exemplifies financial sturdiness and quality business traits. Even this year, with investor risk appetites flowing a bit faster again, large-cap quality as a whole is ahead of the broader market, and in the first four weeks of trading has outperformed the ARK Invest strategy – a proxy for more aggressive, lower-quality stocks – by 15 percentage points. True, ARK and its ilk raced ahead in the 2023 all-in fourth-quarter rally, a tough setup into the year. But the action so far in 2024 is noteworthy as being a near-total inversion of last January, when ARK whistled higher by 25% in a massive short-covering rebound move that was roundly lamented even if it fit with how the market typically acts right after a bear-market bottom. Too much of a good thing? It might seem twisted to ask whether investors collectively are overdoing it on quality, privileging the clear fundamental long-term winners over the less advantaged. But it's worth pointing out that the premium on quality is arguably becoming extreme, as both bullish economic optimists and bearish recession heralds cluster in the proven growers protected by the widest competitive moats. The quality basket's forward price/earnings ratio is not breaking new ground in absolute terms, near 22 now, but its relative multiple is at a decade high. Something similar applies to Berkshire Hathaway, with its $157 billion in cash on hand, near-6% stake in Apple, multi-generational management team and an array of wholly owned businesses exploiting profitable niches. Enviable all around, though also near the very upper end of the stock's price-to-book-value range of the past 15 years. None of this is irrational, though even rational trends can get overdone at times. Carrying the earnings load The narrowness of the S & P 500's performance – which gave way to a two-month broadening pattern heading into 2024 that has not persisted in a clear way in recent weeks – is best explained not by AI enthusiasm or technology worship but by the contribution of the Magnificent Seven companies to overall earnings. Goldman Sachs calculates that those seven companies as a group had profit-growth forecasts for the fourth quarter revised higher by four percentage points since Sept. 30. The other 493 companies in the index together saw fourth-quarter earnings cut by 16 percentage points. And for the first quarter, FactSet says Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Nvidia are projected as a group to report 80% earnings growth, all other companies almost no growth. All of this is about what the quality leaders have done lately, not what sorts of companies represent a better risk-reward equation now. Some disciplined investors are playing for a market less beholden to the acknowledged mega-cap winners. Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock's Target Allocation ETF model portfolio group, initiated a rebalancing away from the QUAL ETF and other growth vehicles areas toward value funds ""to reflect a bullish view on the economy and a soft landing."" This gets at the fact that the premium on quality is in large part the cost of predictability, which is essentially defensive — a way to pay up for insulation against a tough economic trajectory. Sure, there are multi-year secular growth stories animating the AI innovators and weight-loss-drug developers, but most quality stocks stand out for steadiness. For sure, there have been prior market cycles that peaked spectacularly while saturated with a blind belief that no price was too high to pay for the elite corporate winners. The Nifty Fifty period half a century ago most conspicuously, when a few dozen stocks surpassed 40-times earnings in otherwise weak market. And the late-'90s was infused with blue chip fever too in the final stretch to the year-2000 peak. Yet today, the quality trade seems favored less because investors are overconfident in the companies' eternal growth than as a default choice against a large majority of cheaper cyclical stocks in a period when a recession is always feared as imminent but has yet to arrive. Bubble yet? Last week much attention was paid to Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research, who is bullish on stocks yet expressed a fear of irrational exuberance and a late-'90s-style bubble-like melt-up potentially emerging. Yet while the Nasdaq 100 is up almost 50% in a year, it's gained only 5% in the last 26 months. In the 18 months leading into the March 2000 peak, the Nasdaq more than tripled. In 1999 alone, there were nearly 500 IPOs, and their average first-day price gain exceeded 90%. We are now in a prolonged IPO drought and the small-cap growth indexes are flat versus three years ago. The simplest explanation for the market holding near the record highs with the S & P 500 up nearly 20% from the low exactly three months ago is that the market is priced for a pretty benign economic backdrop and we keep getting evidence of a very benign one. Big upside surprise to fourth-quarter GDP with further downside momentum in core inflation adds to the well-earned investor confidence in a macroeconomic cushion. Whether the Federal Reserve clearly signals an interest-rate cut in March next Wednesday or not, everything we know about the Fed's policy decision tree and the path of current data leads to at least modest pruning of rates into a solid economy. For sure, stocks have come a good distance and there are some signs of a short-term ""mission accomplished"" moment. The S & P 500 clicked exactly to 20-times forward earnings last week. Microsoft surmounted the $3 trillion market-cap threshold. Several stubborn Wall Street bears have capitulated with raised index targets to start 2024, sometimes cause for tactical concern. Any give-back of the leading quality growth names wouldn't be easily absorbed by the broader market. We could surely get a sell-the-news response on some of the Mag7 earnings reports in coming days. Or traders might overread some Jerome Powell comments as changing the premise of a friendlier Fed. And February often brings some turbulence to the tape. Yet the crowd's zeal for ""quality"" stocks, the impressive technical caliber of the rally, the upturn in earnings from last year's trough, overall strategist consensus calling for minimal upside from here and investor sentiment held short of hubris by constant doubt about the durability of the expansion, it's unlikely that the next wobble in the indexes would prove to be the Big One.",1/27/2024,1,0.000589388,0.000753265,0.000434575,0.997200012,0.000786729,0.000236126

Here is Jim Cramer's remedy,"Every weekday, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer releases the Homestretch — an actionable afternoon update, just in time for the last hour of trading on Wall Street. (We're no longer recording the audio, so we can get this new written feature to members as quickly as possible.) Markets drop: There was another attempt to lift the market at the beginning of Friday's session, but it failed once again, putting the S & P 500 on track for a six-day losing streak. We keep pointing out that the rallies are happening too early in the session, leading the initial buyers to get caught by scalpers looking to make a quick trade. Volatile markets like this are when patience matters. We're still waiting for that truly ugly open before stepping up our buys. Until we see that crescendo, the oversold market means stay opportunistic but be gradual. That's been our approach this week, with our most-recent trade being a small buy of Estee Lauder on Thursday morning. Bad week for tech : Tech is getting hit hard again Friday, capping off a week in which the Nasdaq 100 fell by more than 5%. The biggest drag in the sector, by far, is Super Micro Computer . Shares of the artificial intelligence server maker were down as much as 20% Friday for a reason you don't see too often: The company hasn't preannounced earnings yet. Super Micro's stock has been one of the biggest winners in the market over the past couple of years due to the rapid construction of data centers around the world. Heavy investments in AI accelerated this trend. As demand for its rack-scale solutions and liquid-cooled systems surged, Super Micro's quarters kept getting better and better, resulting in earnings preannouncements in seven of the past eight quarters, including in January. Last month, the stock was added to the S & P 500. Entering this week, Super Micro was up more than 200% year to date. With earnings getting close on April 30, the fact Super Micro has yet to give a positive preannouncement is being viewed as negative, according to analysts at Wells Fargo. That doesn't mean Super Micro's quarter won't be good — we can't possibly know. But the recent fall in SMCI on no actual announcement is a reminder of a lesson that we shared earlier this year when markets were steadily making new highs: Always be fearful of parabolic moves and make sure you are taking gains on the way up because those kinds of moves are unstainable. Pockets of green: It's not all negative Friday. There's some pretty good strength in energy stocks, financials, consumer staples, health care, and real estate — a sign of money rotating out of hot momentum names and into other areas in the market. Shares of Club holding Coterra Energy rose nearly 2% on Friday, among the best performers in the portfolio. Do the work: Wells Fargo made a new 52-week high Friday, extending its weekly gains to more than 7%. Wells Fargo's strength follows a negative reaction to its first-quarter earnings report last week , even though the results were quite good. That's a theme we've noticed so far this earnings season. There's so much information coming out that sometimes the market gets sloppy and focuses on the wrong things, leading to misread results and ridiculous stock reactions. Fellow Club holdings Constellation Brands and Abbott Laboratories belong in this group, too. The lesson? Don't let the tape be the judge of a quarter. Instead, read the earnings materials and conference calls yourself because doing the work will help you spot opportunities. ""It's important to have confidence in investing. But confidence comes from doing the homework,"" Jim Cramer said Friday. Next week: Rest up over the weekend for an earnings barrage. Roughly 30% of the S & P 500 and 11 Dow components report earnings next week. Among the headliners are a trio of portfolio stocks — Alphabet , Microsoft and Meta Platforms — and beaten-up Tesla . But there are plenty of other big reports to sink our teeth into. Club holdings Danaher , Ford Motor , and Honeywell International are scheduled to report along with Verizon , Cadence Design , Nucor , UPS , GE Aerospace , PepsiCo, RTX , Halliburton , Thermo Fisher Scientific , ServiceNow and Chipotle , among others.

Next week will spotlight the bulk of the Magnificent Seven names, which had a strong start to the year, but have been in a slump as of late. Tesla reports Tuesday, Meta Platforms is out Wednesday. Thursday serves a double whammy with Google-parent Alphabet and Microsoft . But those results are coming at a time when investors are on edge, uncertain where markets are heading after a pushback in rate cut expectations, a recent rise in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, as well as a spike in Treasury yields. On Friday, the S & P 500 was more than 5% off its 52-week high; it also dipped below 5,000, a level the broader index had only reached for the first time ever in February. Wall Street is hoping next week's megacap tech results will give investors insight into where the artificial intelligence trade is going from here, as a bounce in tech could lift the indexes. They're also hoping a slew consumer commentary will give investors insight into the state of the economy. ""Every week of earnings is the most pivotal one, but I really think this one is the most pivotal one,"" said Kim Forrest, founder at Bokeh Capital, adding, ""I think everybody is like me looking to next week thinking, 'This will be the time where we can figure out the direction of the market.'"" On Friday, the S & P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite registered losing weeks. Further gains, or buying opportunity? As a whole, the bar is high for the Magnificent Seven, even as there are increasing divergences between the names. Tesla, for example, will be in the spotlight next week. Investors are hoping for some positive news out of electric vehicle maker, which is the second-worst performer in the S & P 500 this year as it contends with slowing sales and rising competition from China. This week, Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock to hold from buy following a Reuters report of the possible scrapping of a low-cost car. In response, CEO Elon Musk said Reuters was ""lying."" Shares were down 14% this week. Investors a sense of how artificial intelligence will be monetized, seeking insight into growing Google's cloud business , as well as Microsoft's Copilot chatbot. ""These will give us some of the best indications of AI demand,"" said Emily Leveille, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management, adding, ""We expect earnings, I think, to be pretty good for at least for Microsoft and for Meta, just considering sort of recent momentum in earnings growth."" Horizon Investments' Scott Ladner urged caution ahead of the reports given the high expectations swirling around the megacaps. However, he said any pullback in the tech names could give investors an opening to start ""nibbling away"" at additional exposure. While the investment chief anticipates further volatility over the next several weeks, he said he anticipates stocks can again rise over the intermediate term, and gain another 10% from here. ""Especially with the AI trade, those expectations have been ramped up. And so, we would probably be a little bit cautious in terms of getting exposure to those names ahead of earnings releases because that bar is quite high,"" Ladner said. ""But if we do get a sell-off associated with those releases that don't hit up on those raised expectations, it probably is, we think, a better buying opportunity than a selling opportunity at that point,"" Ladner added. He also advised investors to start adding exposure to other interesting assets such as in Europe, or in small caps, which could jump after the central bank cuts rates later this year. Consumer focus Wall Street is also anticipating commentary from consumer-facing companies next week that could give insight into the state of the economy. Investors are hoping that consumer spending, which has thus far held up the economy in the face of higher prices, remains robust. Earnings results from Visa, for example, will be on deck. ""From a sentiment standpoint, consumers don't feel very good, but they haven't acted like that for the better part of years,"" Horizon's Ladner said. ""So, the bigger thing that we've been looking for and look for this quarter, is, are the consumers still acting like they're in good shape? Even if they feel a little bit down in the dumps because they don't like the price that they're paying for things, are they are they still paying those prices? Are they still borrowing? Are they still consuming?"" ""So long as that is continues to be the case, which we expect it to be, we think this consumer-facing company is probably going to have a pretty good rebound in the second half of the year,"" Ladner added. On the economic front, next week will also bring the first-quarter gross domestic product number. Economists polled by FactSet are anticipating the U.S. economy will have expanded by 3.1%, in line with the prior reading. Week ahead calendar All times ET.

They'll be able to offer no-cost advice and may suggest options your servicer doesn't.

Mortgage assistance

There are private, state and federal programs to help homeowners with their mortgage payments. The Treasury Department's $9.96 billion Homeowner Assistance Fund was launched during the pandemic, but it's not limited to households impacted by COVID-19. There are income requirements, however, and the program is scheduled to sunset in 2026.



You'll have to check if your state is still accepting applications. Most states have additional assistance programs, as do federal agencies like the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Veteran Affairs. Keep an eye out for mortgage relief scammers, who may promise to change the terms of your loan or guarantee that you'll keep your house. According to the Federal Trade Commission, asking for payment upfront, a retainer fee or for the deed to your house to be transferred are all red flags.

Mortgage forbearance

Your servicer may agree to temporarily pause or reduce payments while you get your finances in order. A mortgage forbearance agreement lays out the terms of this arrangement, including how much time you'll have to bring your payments current.



As part of the agreement, a lender agrees to hold off foreclosure proceedings. Forbearance periods can last up to 18 months, according to the CFPB, which can help with a short-term setback like a job loss or medical emergency. It's not a permanent solution, though, and your credit score may still take a hit.

Loan modification

While forbearance offers a temporary respite, modification can change the terms of your loan, the interest rate you pay or both. Borrowers typically request loan modification after a forbearance period, according to the CFPB, so you'll have to prove you're not at risk of defaulting again.



You'll also need to provide pay stubs, bank statements, tax returns and other financial documents, as well as a hardship letter explaining your circumstances.



According to Fannie Mae, borrowers may also request a modification if they've repeatedly been denied refinancing. If your loan is at least 115% of the value of your home, you may qualify for the Principal Reduction Alternative program, which can lower your monthly payment and interest rate. Like forbearance, loan modifications are reported to credit agencies and may affect your credit score.

Repayment plan

If your forbearance period is ending, your mortgage servicer might allow you to break up the missed payments into smaller amounts and repay them over months, rather than all at once. Unlike a loan modification, the terms and interest rate wouldn't change. This type of mortgage relief is available to borrowers after they've missed a payment or more, according to Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae's mortgage repayment calculator shows you what your repayment plan could look like.

Mortgage refinance

If you can refinance your home loan to a lower interest rate, it may lower your monthly payments. The largest mortgage lender in the U.S., Rocket Mortgage considers applicants with credit scores as low as 580 and offers no-closing-cost refinances. In 2023, J.D. Power ranked Rocket number one for client satisfaction for the ninth year in a row.

Sell your home

If other options aren't available, you may need to sell your home and either downsize or rent to keep your financial woes from compounding.



In a short sale, you would sell the house for less than what remains on the mortgage. If your lender agrees, they would forgive the remainder of the loan. A short sale can significantly impact your credit score, but it might be the best choice if you can't wait for a good offer or if your mortgage is underwater.

Deed-in-lieu of foreclosure

Although you'd have to give up your house, a deed in lieu agreement enables you to avoid foreclosure, which can knock your credit score down by more than 100 points and make it difficult to buy another home. In exchange for surrendering the property, your lender would forgive the remainder of your mortgage, according to the CFPB. Some borrowers request a deed-in-lieu agreement when their mortgage is underwater. You'll lose any existing equity on the property and may have to pay tax on the forgiven loan balance.

569,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/10/rich-americans-get-second-passports-citing-risk-of-instability.html,V,Visa Inc.,"The rich are getting second passports, citing risk of instability","Recent high-profile examples of second citizenships include billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel, who added a citizenship in New Zealand, and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who applied for citizenship in Cyprus.

""The U.S. is still a great country, it's still an amazing passport,"" said Dominic Volek, group head of private clients at Henley & Partners. ""But if I'm wealthy, I would like to hedge against levels of volatility and uncertainty. The idea of diversification is well understood by wealthy individuals around what they invest. It makes no sense to have one country of citizenship and residence when I have the ability to actually diversify that aspect of my life as well.""

The wealthy are building these ""passport portfolios"" — collections of second, and even third or fourth, citizenships — in case they need to flee their home country. Henley & Partners, a law firm that specializes in high-net-worth citizenships, said Americans now outnumber every other nationality when it comes to securing alternative residences or added citizenships.

Wealthy U.S. families are increasingly applying for second citizenships and national residences as a way to hedge their financial risk, according to a leading law firm.

A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.

Of course, the wealthy aren't packing up en masse and ditching their American citizenship. While a relatively small number of Americans do renounce their citizenship every year to declare a new home country, mainly due to tax-filing requirements, the so-called ""exit tax"" required to renounce citizenship makes it financially prohibitive for most except the ultra-wealthy to simply renounce and declare a new citizenship.

Instead, many wealthy Americans are shopping around for an added visa or citizenship program to supplement their U.S. passport.

According to Henley, the top destinations for supplemental passports among Americans are Portugal, Malta, Greece and Italy. Portugal's ""Golden Visa"" program is especially popular since it provides a path to residency and citizenship — with visa-free travel in Europe — in exchange for an investment of 500,000 euros (roughly $541,000) in a fund or private equity. Malta offers a Golden Visa for 300,000 euros invested in real estate, which Volek said has become ""especially popular with Americans.""

""With Malta you become a European citizen, with complete settlement rights across Europe,"" he said. ""So you can live in Germany, your kids can go and study in France and you have the right to live, work and study throughout Europe.""

There are three main reasons for the rise of American passport portfolios, or ""domicile diversification."" An alternative passport makes travel easier for Americans venturing to parts of the world that are less friendly to the U.S.

""For American, British, and Israeli citizens suddenly unsure of their welcome abroad, supplementary passports provide vital flexibility,"" according to a Henley report. ""With rising global instability, holding citizenship in another country, particularly one that is considered more neutral or politically benign, now provides a valuable back-up or alternative option.""

Another reason is business travel, which can be safer and less conspicuous with a non-U.S. passport in many countries. U.S. business leaders could be targets for ""resentment, hostage-taking, or random terrorism in the chaos of collapsed states or high-risk countries they need to travel to for business purposes,"" according to the report, which says interested parties range from hedge-fund managers who meet with global clients to mining company executives who visit operations sites.

Using a secondary passport can also help cross-border financial transfers or deals within the new country.

Finally, some wealthy Americans simply want a back-up residency for possible retirement, to be closer to their families who live abroad or for lifestyle reasons in the new age of remote work. For others, U.S. politics is the driver.

""We all live in uncertain times, not just in the U.S., but in all nations globally,"" Volek said. ""Who knows what's going to happen next. It's really about having not only a Plan B but Plan C and D in place as well.""",4/10/2024,0,0.000613131,0.9965204,0.000430727,0.000603395,0.000600708,0.001231621

New additions to the S & P 500 since 1990 have returned 4.3%, or 8.7% annualized, on average, in the six months after they've joined the broad market index, according to Bank of America's investment and exchange-traded funds strategist Jared Woodard. Stocks cycle on and off the major averages, with the most recent example being Walgreens Boots Alliance 's deletion from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and its replacement by Amazon on Monday. Woodard noted that changes to the S & P 500 typically occur following a period of strong growth. The S & P 500 has gained more than 24% in the past year and has climbed more than 4% from the start of 2024. There are two main criteria for adding a stock to the S & P 500, the strategist said. First, a company's prior four quarters of earnings on generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, basis must be positive. Second, the stock's market capitalization must be in the 85th percentile of the S & P 1500. Here's a look at some of the stocks Bank of America thinks are in contention for entry to the S & P 500.

Four of the 17 analysts covering the stock say it's a buy or strong buy, and average price targets suggest downside of 20%, according to FactSet.

So far, more than 14% of S & P 500 companies have reported. Of those companies, 73.6% have beaten earnings expectations, FactSet data shows. Here's a look at some of the biggest reports of the week and what analysts think — along with a look at potential implications for the broader market. Investment banks doing well, BofA not so much The major banks that posted results this week — Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley and Bank of America — beat earnings expectations. Nonetheless, that didn't translate into a positive stock reaction for all three of them. Bank of America shares fell more than 3% despite the company beating on both top and bottom lines. Net interest income, a key metric of how much money a bank makes from loans, was $14.19 billion, above the $13.93 billion StreetAccount estimate. However, net interest income was lower on a yearly basis. Finance chief Alastair Borthwick also told analysts during a post-earnings conference call that net interest income will likely decline in the second quarter due to drops in wealth management, before potentially rebounding later in 2024. To be sure, Wells Fargo's Mike Mayo said Bank of America's first-quarter results were ""not too surprising"" and benefited from improved capital market conditions. He remains confident in the bank's reputation, deposits and credit quality in relation to its big bank peers. ""Overall, BAC is a Goliath at a time when Goliath is winning,"" Mayo wrote in a Tuesday note. Mayo has an overweight rating on Bank of America. BAC 5D mountain BAC 5-day chart Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley shares climbed around 3% and 2.5% each following their earnings announcements. For the week, they are up 3.7% and 6%, respectively. Analysts from JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo all raised their price targets on Goldman following its positive results. Wells Fargo's Mayo said the firm is ""likely best-of-breed"" among its peers. The bank's pivot away from commercial banking into a renewed emphasis on its asset and wealth management segments is a positive for Goldman, per Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala. He named Goldman as one of the best names to own thanks to its exposure to a broader uptick in investment banking activity, as well as secular trends including more financing opportunities for artificial intelligence projects and a growth in private credit. Mayo prefers Goldman over Morgan Stanley, for which he holds an equal weight rating on shares. The company posted a growth in wealth inflows and revenue. However, Mayo remains concerned about the flat NII in the wealth segment, keeping him on the sidelines. UnitedHealth crushes estimates, but cyberattack still an overhang UnitedHealth's results easily exceeded analyst expectations, sending shares soaring more than 14%. That would be its biggest weekly gain since April 2020, when it rallied 15%. However, management noted the ongoing fallout of the cyberattack on its subsidiary Change Healthcare will result in an impact on full-year earnings of between $1.15 and $1.35 per share. ""So while core MLR [medical loss ratio] in Q1 was slightly higher than expected, the outlook for the year seems largely inline with expectations, alleviating investor concerns around runaway medical cost trends and the risk from that to EPS,"" Deutsche analyst George Hill said in a Thursday note. He reiterated his buy rating on the stock, and slightly increased his price target to $562 from $545. UNH 5D mountain UNH 5-day chart Netflix concerns Netflix had a strong start to 2024 across the board, but its weaker-than-expected full-year revenue outlook weighed on sentiment. The streaming service also announced it would stop reporting quarterly subscriber numbers — a key metric watched by traders ahead of the report — and average revenue per membership starting next year. Shares fell on Friday more than 8% and were headed for their worst day since July 2023. ""Overall, NFLX's 1Q was very clean, but we'd expect pushback from the 2024 revenue growth outlook, ongoing concerns about slowdown of Paid Sharing benefits & advertising monetization, & valuation,"" JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth wrote in a Friday note. He reiterated his overweight rating and $650 price target on shares. Bank of America also remains bullish on shares. Analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich kept her buy rating and $700 price target, which she said is supported by its increased visibility in growth drivers and strength in innovation. Not all firms were as optimistic, however. Goldman Sachs retained its neutral rating on the stock, while Canaccord Genuity downgraded shares to hold from buy on slower forecasted growth. The reduced subscriber disclosures ""add to uncertainty,"" the firm said. Mixed earnings picture Although nearly three-quarters of the reported earnings so far have topped expectations, the broader picture is more muddled. Profit growth is on track to disappoint, according to FactSet data. The blended earnings growth rate, which considers the reports already out and the estimates from those still pending, sits at just 0.16%. Analysts expected year-over-year profit expansion of more than 3% heading into the season, per FactSet. Revenue beats have also lagged earnings, with just 61% of companies exceeding top-line expectations. First-quarter results ""have been a mostly negative catalyst for large caps, with below-typical sales beat rates. Demand has come in lighter than expected, though 'higher-end' consumers remain resilient with record household wealth and cash balances,"" wrote Wells Fargo strategist Chris Harvey. He forecasts more downward revisions to forward guidance, versus raises, from the companies scheduled to report going forward. Next week, about 150 S & P 500 names are slated to report, including Microsoft, Exxon Mobil, Alphabet and Tesla.",4/19/2024,1,0.716014981,0.186127946,0.003281608,0.077712826,0.013753512,0.003109205

Credit score needed for the Wells Fargo Active Cash Card

To be eligible for the Wells Fargo Active Cash Card, a credit score within the good to excellent range is typically needed — at least 670 or higher according to the FICO® Score range — for the best chance of approval. However, even if your credit score is up to par, you may still get rejected for the card due to specific factors that the issuer looks at. For example, Wells Fargo may restrict application approval if you've previously opened a Wells Fargo credit card within the last six months. Additionally, Wells Fargo may limit the amount of credit cards you have with them. While there's no clear limit on the number of cards that you're allowed to have with Wells Fargo, they do impose restrictions. To qualify for the $200 cash rewards bonus, you must also meet certain criteria, including spending at least $500 on purchases within three months of opening the card.

How to improve your credit score

If you find your credit score doesn't quite cut it for the Wells Fargo Active Cash Card, you may want to work on raising your number before applying. Two of the most important factors that make up your score are your payment history and credit utilization ratio. The general rule of thumb is to maintain a credit utilization ratio below 30%. So, if your credit limit is $1,000, aim to spend under $300. Also, be sure to make your monthly payments on time and in full. Another way you could boost your score is with a service like *Experian Boost™, which allows you to add payment activity that's usually not reported to the credit bureau (such as utility, telecom and streaming service bills) to your credit file.

During this period, you can also qualify for the intro balance transfer fee of either $5 or 3% of the transferred amount (whichever is greater). The regular balance transfer fee on the card is 5% (with a minimum of $5). Note that your balance transfer won't earn you rewards. The Wells Fargo Active Cash offers 2% cash rewards on purchases, but balance transfers are considered a different transaction category. Still, this is a generous offer. For example, let's say you want to transfer a $1,000 balance from a card with a 20% APR. If you pay $75 per month, you'll pay it off in 15 months, losing $138 to interest. But if you transfer the balance to the Wells Fargo Active Cash, you'll pay it off in under 14 months if you make the same monthly payment. Moreover, you'll save $108 after subtracting the 3% balance transfer fee. But if you have a higher credit card balance, 15 months might not be enough time to pay it all off. If that's the case, consider applying for a different balance transfer card. For example, Wells Fargo also offers the Wells Fargo Reflect® Card that gives you 0% intro APR for 21 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers (18.24%, 24.74% or 29.99% variable APR thereafter). There's an intro balance transfer fee of 5% for each balance transfer, with a minimum of $5 completed within 120 days from account opening qualify for the introductory rate. The card has a $0 annual fee.

How to transfer a balance to the Wells Fargo Active Cash

If you've done the math and decided that the Wells Fargo Active Cash is the right card for your balance transfer, there are several steps you'll need to complete. Get approved for the card. You'll most likely need good or excellent credit to qualify. Request a balance transfer within 120 days. You can do so by logging in to your online account or calling the issuer. Note that not all accounts are eligible for balance transfers, although Wells Fargo doesn't specify how that's determined. Provide the required information, including account numbers for your creditors and the amounts you want to transfer. Your balance transfer limit is typically your credit limit, unless the issuer indicates otherwise. Wait for your balance transfer to go through. Your request may take up to two weeks to reflect in your account. In the meantime, make sure to continue paying your old card on time.

What to do after you transfer the balance

Once you complete the balance transfer, the real work begins. For the transfer to save you money and help you ditch the debt, you'll need plenty of patience and dedication. Here are some tips on how to make it all work. Stay disciplined You want to ensure you pay off the transferred balance before the intro period expires. This way, you can avoid hefty interest charges. Additionally, if you still have some leftover balance on your old card, make your monthly payments on time and stay committed to your debt payoff goal. Avoid making new purchases A balance transfer frees up the credit limit on your old card. This might tempt you to spend and add to that card's low balance. Resist — it's too easy to slip into even more debt if you don't. Commit to healthy credit habits A balance transfer might be a convenient debt consolidation tool. But ideally want to avoid taking on so much debt in the first place. Practice living within your means and beef up your savings so that an emergency won't put you in the red. If you haven't yet, start building an emergency fund and keep it in a high-yield savings account. CNBC Select recommends LendingClub which consistently advertises a high APY. You'll need an initial $100 deposit to open the account, but afterward, there's no minimum balance required.

The Wells Fargo Active Cash is a flat-rate cash-rewards credit card with a $0 annual fee. It offers unlimited 2% cash rewards on purchases — a simple rewards system that allows you to earn bonus cash rewards on most of your credit card spending. The card's welcome bonus also comes with spending requirements that should be easy to meet. Currently, you can get $200 in cash rewards when you spend $500 on purchases in your first three months with the card. Additionally, the Wells Fargo Active Cash offers 0% intro APR for 15 months from account opening on purchases and qualifying balance transfers. After that, a variable APR of 20.24%, 25.24% or 29.99% kicks in. Note, only balance transfers you make within 120 days qualify for the intro rate. As you can see, the Wells Fargo Active Cash requires little effort on your part while providing consistent value. For that reason, it can be worth considering in the following situations: You want a simple rewards credit card. Some cardholders are great at keeping track of rotating cash-back categories and decoding the best travel card's redemptions. But it's not for everyone — and there's nothing wrong with that. If you want a simple but rewarding cash-back system, the Wells Fargo Active Cash can give you just that.

Many of the best rewards credit cards charge annual fees. If you'd rather avoid those, the Wells Fargo Active Cash can be a good choice. You want a 0% APR card that offers ongoing value. You can find cards with longer intro 0% APR periods, but they're less likely to earn rewards. Of course, no card is perfect for every scenario. For example, if you want to focus on travel rewards, you might spread your spending too thin if you add a cash-back card into the mix. The Wells Fargo Active Cash also might not be worth it if you're looking for a card with premium benefits. You're more likely to find those on annual-fee cards.

Ulta — The beauty chain slipped more than 1% following a downgrade to hold from buy at Jefferies. Analyst Ashley Helgans cited mounting pressure from competitor Sephora as well as a ""lack of newness"" as two reasons for the change. Netflix — Shares slid nearly 6% after the video streaming platform shared a weaker full-year revenue growth outlook than consensus had expected and said it would no longer report quarterly subscriber gains going forward. Despite this, Netflix posted a first-quarter earnings and revenue beat . Shopify — The Canada-based e-commerce stock jumped 3%. Morgan Stanley upgraded Shopify to an overweight rating, citing confidence in the company's growth potential and operating leverage upside. First Solar — Shares gained 1.5% after Wells Fargo upgraded shares to overweight. The firm cited several upside catalysts, including the expectation that the Biden Administration will revoke tariff exemptions and potential trade restrictions on Chinese panels. Sunnova Energy — The stock slipped nearly 4% after a Wells Fargo downgrade to equal weight. The bank thinks that a higher-for-longer rate environment will be particularly detrimental for Sunnova's upcoming debt maturities and tight liquidity. SLB — The energy stock dipped 1.7% despite a first-quarter report that was largely in line with expectations. SLB reported 75 cents in adjusted earnings per share on $8.71 billion of revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG were expected 75 cents per share on $8.69 billion of revenue. The company did say that revenue fell in North America. Intuitive Surgical — Shares of the robotic surgery firm popped 3% after posting a first quarter earnings and revenue beat. Intuitive Surgical reported adjusted earnings of $1.50 per share last quarter, while analysts polled by LSEG had estimated $1.41. Western Alliance — Shares slipped 2% after the firm missed earnings expectations in its latest quarter. Western Alliance reported earnings of $1.60 per share, while FactSet had estimated this at $1.64 per share. KB Home — The homebuilding stock climbed 1.6% after announcing a share repurchase plan amounting up to $1 billion . KB Home also said that it would raise its quarterly cash dividend by 25% to 25 cents per share, payable on May 23. Paramount — The media stock soared 10% after the New York Times and Bloomberg reported that Sony Pictures Entertainment and Apollo Global Management have been discussing the possibility of teaming up to acquire Paramount in a joint bid . This comes amid Paramount's talks to merge with production firm Skydance Media. Bentley Systems — French energy management and automation firm Schneider Electric confirmed that it was currently in preliminary talks regarding a potential strategic transaction of Bentley Systems, sending the software stock up less than 1%. Proctor & Gamble — The consumer products maker reported mixed results for its latest quarter, with earnings of $1.52 per share beating analysts' estimates of $1.41 per share, according to LSEG. The company slightly missed revenue expectations, however, posting $20.20 billion, while analysts expected $20.41 billion. Shares were little changed in premarket trading. American Express — Shares slid 1.5% despite the financial services company posting a first-quarter earnings and revenue beat above FactSet estimates.

All times ET. 7:38 a.m.: Edward Jones downgrades Hershey, cites record-high cocoa prices Edward Jones is moving to the sidelines on Hershey despite its leading brand position. ""Hershey is facing headwinds from record-high cocoa prices, which we expect to limit near-term earnings growth,"" wrote analyst Brittany Quatrochi as she downgraded shares to a hold rating. To be sure, Quatrochi expects Hershey to partially offset elevated cocoa prices by hiking prices and downsizing sizes. New product innovations and international growth should also drive sales growth. ""These long-term positives are balanced by our belief that it will take several years for Hershey to offset higher cocoa costs, which we expect to weigh on earnings growth in the near term,"" she wrote. Hershey shares have dipped less than 1% this year. – Samantha Subin 7:03 a.m.: Loop Capital says buy this 'category killer' with more than 30% upside It's time to take a look at this food delivery platform and ""category killer,"" according to Loop Capital. Analyst Rob Sanderson initiated coverage of DoorDash with a buy rating and $170 price target, citing strong execution. ""We think that years of debate over viability and earnings potential of on-demand gig platforms has been settled,"" he wrote. ""Industry leaders like DoorDash have demonstrated continued momentum postpandemic and the ramp in free cash generation is undeniable."" DoorDash shares have rallied more than 31% so far this year, with the firm's $170 price target suggesting that shares can rally another 31% from here. ""While DoorDash carries a valuation premium vs. many peers, it is justified by a higher growth rate, best-in-class execution and earnings power that we think is meaningfully understated by investment in new categories, new regions and new products,"" Sanderson said. – Samantha Subin 6:48 a.m.: Wolfe Research upgrades Bank of America as net interest income reaches an 'inflection' Now is the time to buy shares of Bank of America, according to Wolfe Research. Analyst Steven Chubak upgraded Bank of America to an outperform rating, citing expectations for a net interest income turnaround and a discounted valuation. ""While some of these NII pressures should persist in a higher-for-longer rate backdrop, with BAC's 1Q24 results reflecting better asset repricing trends … we believe that we're now approaching the point of NII inflection where ""under-earning"" banks including both BAC and SCHW should post stronger gains following multiple years of underperformance,"" he wrote. Shares of Bank of America have added 6% this year, with the firm's $42 price targets suggesting that shares can rally another 17%. Along with improving net interest income, Chubak also noted that Bank of America appears to be gaining market share in trading and investment banking, which should bode well for fee growth. ""Combined with a discounted valuation and the capacity to repurchase ~16% of market capitalization through YE25 (by our estimates), we are more confident in BAC's ability to drive durable EPS growth over the next few years,"" he wrote. – Samantha Subin 6:28 a.m.: Wells Fargo upgrades First Solar to overweight, says shares can surge more than 40% Investors should consider snatching up ""port in the storm"" stock First Solar, according to Wells Fargo.

""While it's hard to predict which of the following regulations will pass, at a minimum, we see many ways in which FSLR could maintain [average selling prices] through the end of the decade (implies a $340/sh stock price) and a few scenarios in which [average sales prices] increase further from here (implies at least a $390/sh stock price),"" he wrote. Blum cites a slew of catalysts for the upgrade, including the expectation that The Biden Administration will revoke tariff exemption of bifacial modules used in solar and potential trade restrictions on Chinese panels. New proposals would also bar solar companies based in China from obtaining Inflation Reduction Act credits. Blum's adjusted $250 price target implies that shares can rally 43% from Thursday's close. The stock added 1% before the bell and is up 1% this year. Alongside the upgrade, Blum downgraded Sunnova Energy to an equal weight rating and slashed his price target to $6 from $11, citing a higher-for-longer rate environment. The stock lost nearly 4% before the bell. ""While some companies can afford to wait for rates to fall & the [residential] solar market to rebound, NOVA has upcoming debt maturities & tight liquidity,"" he wrote.

""A disciplined view on headcount provides room for further operating leverage against more measured expectations, supporting our upgrade to Overweight.""

SHOP YTD mountain SHOP year to date Underpinning the firm's overweight rating is a bet that Shopify will expand its international traction and hold onto 20% growth even as consumer expectations moderate. Weiss also estimates that advertising can add 100 basis points to the company's take rate by 2030, while a ""largely flat headcount"" should benefit 2024 operating margins. The take rate refers to the fees collected on a sale. ""Despite questions around the durability of Shopify's operating margin expansion following Q4 results, we believe investor expectations have over corrected and commentary pointing to modest headcount expansion in FY24 still leaves room for further realization of operating leverage and FCF growth in the business,"" Weiss wrote. — Samantha Subin 5:53 a.m.: Canaccord Genuity downgrades Netflix, cites slower growth ahead Beware of slower growth ahead for Netflix , according to Canaccord Genuity. Analyst Maria Ripps downgraded the media giant to hold from buy after its first-quarter print, saying the company's paid sharing initiative ""meaningfully pulled forward member growth."" ""Despite these mostly solid results and outlook, we see limited growth catalysts for the next few quarters and with the stock up ~90% over the last 12 months and up ~25% YTD, we think investors may be well served to look elsewhere for upside and are downgrading the stock to hold,"" she wrote. Shares slumped nearly 6% before the bell even after Netflix topped first-quarter results and reported a 16% rise in total memberships in extended trading Thursday. NFLX 1D mountain NFLX falls Along with the results, Netflix also said it plans to stop reporting quarterly membership numbers and average revenue per member, which Ripps views as further contributing to this ""uncertainty."" ""We think this decision and the timing of when the company plans to sunset the disclosure indicates that member growth may become challenged in FY25, as paid sharing likely pulled forward member additions, although that benefit could still continue for another few quarters,"" she said. Despite the news, some Wall Street majors retained their overweight rating on the stock. Although net additions will likely subside in 2025, Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall expects average revenue per user to accelerate as Netflix's advertising program rolls out across the U.S. and Canada. Price hikes later this year in other countries and the continued build-out of Netflix's advertising tier should also help offset some pressures on average revenue per user, added JPMorgan's Doug Anmuth. Elsewhere, Morgan Stanley's Benjamin Swinburne viewed the results and outlook as a sign that the company can support 25% to 30% EPS growth. ""The business model transition put into place two years ago, when growth stalled, appears well on track,"" he wrote.

""As we look forward, our business performance remains sensitive to interest rates and the health of the U.S. economy, but we are confident that the actions we are taking will drive stronger returns over the cycle,"" said CEO Charlie Scharf in the earnings release. ""We are closely monitoring credit and while we see modest deterioration, it remains consistent with our expectations.""

Scharf said earnings in the latest period were helped by a strong economy and higher interest rates as well as cost-cutting efforts put in place by the bank. Still, Wells Fargo's stock fell 3.3%.

Here's what the bank reported versus what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: $1.29, adjusted vs. $1.17 expected.

$1.29, adjusted vs. $1.17 expected. Revenue: $20.48 billion vs. $20.30 billion expected.

In the quarter ending Dec. 31, 2023, Wells Fargo posted net income of $3.45 billion, or 86 cents per share, up slightly from $3.16 billion, or 75 cents a share, a year ago.

Earnings were lowered by a $1.9 billion charge from a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation special assessment tied to the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and a $969 million charge from severance expenses. Wells Fargo also recorded a $621 million, or 17 cents per share, tax benefit. Excluding these items, the company earned $1.29 a share, which was better than analysts had predicted.

Total revenue came in at $20.48 billion for the period. That's a 2% increase from the fourth quarter of 2022 when Wells Fargo posted $20.30 billion in revenue. The company also topped earnings expectations, posting adjusted earnings of $1.29 per share, versus an LSEG estimate of $1.17.

Wells Fargo said net interest income fell 5% from a year ago to $12.78 billion, and warned that the figure could come in 7% to 9% lower for the full year from $52.4 billion in 2023. The decline in net interest income was due to lower deposit and loan balances, but offset slightly by higher interest rates, the bank said.

Provisions for credit losses rose 34% to $1.28 billion from $957 million a year ago, as allowances for credit losses rose for credit card and commercial real estate loans. Wells Fargo said that was partially offset by lower allowances for auto loans.

Wells Fargo shares are virtually flat this year after rallying more than 19% in 2023. During the period, the 10-year Treasury yield topped the 5% threshold in October, before finishing the year below 3.9%.

587,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/04/eli-lilly-launches-website-to-help-patients-get-weight-loss-drugs.html,WST,West Pharmaceutical Services,Eli Lilly launches website to help patients get weight loss drugs,"Drugmaker Eli Lilly announced on Thursday a new website that will allow patients to get a weight loss drug prescription through a telehealth provider — a move, the company says, that will improve access to the extremely popular and effective drugs, including its recently approved drug, Zepbound.

The new website, called LillyDirect, joins a growing list of platforms like Weight Watchers and Ro offering weight loss drugs through telehealth, but is the first of its kind from a pharmaceutical company.

It comes less than two months after the Food and Drug Administration approved Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound. The drug is the latest entrant into the field of the powerful — and pricy — class of medications called GLP-1 agonists, which includes Lilly's Mounjaro as well as Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy.

""We're used to buying consumer goods directly from manufacturers all the time on online websites,"" said Lilly CEO David Ricks. ""It really hasn't been an option that's been provided before"" for prescription drugs.

Ricks said the new platform will make it easier for patients to access the drugs, cutting out the need to go to the doctor to get a prescription and then to a pharmacy to fill it. Patients who are prescribed Zepbound will be eligible for Lilly's at-home prescription delivery service.

There won't be price discounts for any of the medications through the website, however, which, at a list price of more than $1,000 for a month's supply and often not covered by insurance, puts them out of reach for most Americans. Patients will still need to meet the criteria for the weight loss drugs, which are meant for long-term use, not quick weight loss.

Some experts, however, expressed concerns about the platform and raised questions about Lilly's financial motives.

""What fuels my skepticism is that the stakes are so high,"" said Arthur Caplan, the head of the division of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.

Other companies also offer weight loss prescriptions through telemedicine, but not a drug company with its own weight loss drug, Caplan said.

""There's so much money that's going to move with these injectables,"" he said. ""That creates at least the appearance of conflict of interest.""

Lilly itself isn't providing the telehealth services. Instead, LillyDirect will connect patients with the telehealth provider Form Health, whose obesity medicine doctors will work with patients to determine whether a prescription is appropriate.

Neither Form Health nor its physicians will receive financial compensation for prescribing Lilly's drug, Ricks said.

Evan Richardson, the CEO of Form Health, said that patients who are prescribed a weight loss drug will meet over video with a doctor on an ongoing basis, typically once a month.

The doctors will work independently and will be able to prescribe any FDA-approved weight loss drug — they won't be required to prescribe Lilly's Zepbound.

But only those prescribed Zepbound will be eligible for Lilly's at-home prescription delivery service, Ricks said.",1/4/2024,2,0.000492278,0.997745216,0.000515571,0.00060271,0.000347928,0.0002963

How to filing a tax extension

Ignoring your return is a bad idea: Interest and penalties accrue immediately after Tax Day and continue until your balance is paid in full. Eventually, the government could garnish your wages, place a lien on your property or even revoke your passport. You can file an extension if you need more time to complete your return. You'll still have to pay any outstanding taxes by April 15, 2024, but you'll have more time to get your forms together. ""It's an extension of time to send in your documents, not to pay your money,"" Steber said. There are three ways to file for an extension: Pay all or part of the estimated tax due using Direct Pay, the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System or a credit card or debit card.

589,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/28/ftx-fraudster-sam-bankman-fried-seeks-less-than-7-years-in-prison.html,WMB,Williams Companies,"FTX fraudster Bankman-Fried seeks less than 7 year sentence, claims he is at risk of 'harm and extortion' in prison","Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of FTX Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange, arrives at court in New York, US, on Thursday, Feb. 16, 2023.

He was convicted at trial in November and is due to be sentenced on March 28.

Bankman-Fried has been in jail since his bail was revoked in August, eight months after he was indicted on multiple fraud charges and other counts related to the dramatic collapse of FTX in late 2022.

""It is, he has told me, the first thing he thinks about when he wakes up and the last thing he thinks about when he goes to sleep, and it occupies many moments in between,"" wrote Fried, who like her husband, Joseph Bankman, is a Stanford law professor.

The filing quotes a letter from his mother, Barbara Fried, who wrote that her son ""has been wracked with remorse for not having prevented the implosion of FTX and the damage that followed.""

The lawyers wrote that Bankman-Fried, 31, is ""full of regret for the enormous damage that he has caused his (former) friends, family, partners, colleagues, and the causes he cared so deeply about.""

""But they don't know the true Sam Bankman-Fried,"" the attorneys argued in rebutting the 100-year prison term recommended by a presentence investigation report by federal probation officials.

""Sam Bankman-Fried has been described as a 'sociopath,' 'a man with no morals, remorse or empathy,' who is an 'an ice-cold manipulator, bully and shameless liar,'"" his lawyers told Manhattan federal court Judge Lewis Kaplan in the filing.

That filing, among other things, cites his ""neurodiversity,"" selflessness and ""kindness"" — and strongly disputes claims he cost his companies' customers billions of dollars with fraud.

In a new court filing, attorneys for Bankman-Fried asked for a sentence of between 63 and 78 months in prison for overseeing the huge financial fraud at his cryptocurrency exchange FTX and related hedge fund Alameda Research.

Lawyers for Sam Bankman-Fried are asking a judge for a relatively short sentence like ""junk bond king"" Michael Milken instead of the 100 years that a presentence investigation report calls for.

The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, which prosecuted Bankman-Fried, has yet to file its sentencing recommendation but is expected to call for a much stiffer sentence than that called for by defense lawyers in their new filing.

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams in November said, ""Bankman-Fried perpetrated one of the biggest financial frauds in American history,"" and scoffed at the idea that the FTX founder's conduct was motivated by altruism.

""This case has always been about lying, cheating, and stealing, and we have no patience for it,"" Williams said at the time.

In their new, nearly 100-page document, defense attorneys marshal an array of arguments designed to get Kaplan to dramatically depart downward from federal sentencing guidelines, which recommend that he give Bankman-Fried 100 years or more in prison.

""That recommendation is grotesque,"" the defense team led by attorney Marc Mukasey wrote in the filing.

""This Court should reject the [Presentence Investigation Report's] barbaric proposal.""

The federal guidelines in the case suggest a draconian sentence for Bankman-Fried in large part as the result of the $10 billion loss by FTX and Alameda Research customers in the case, as the Presentence Investigation Report concluded.

Defense lawyers in their sentencing submission said that the loss calculation is unsupported by evidence, arguing that ""the most reasonable estimate of loss is zero.""

The filing notes that last month, debtors' attorneys in the bankruptcy case of FTX and Alameda said that ""customers and creditors who can prove their losses are expected to get back all of their money.""

""The harm to customers, lenders, and investors is zero,"" Bankman-Fried's lawyers wrote.

In addition to attacking at length the rationale of the sentencing guidelines' recommendation, SBF's lawyers spent a large chunk of the filing detailing his personal history, psychological makeup and ""charitable works.""

It says he created Alameda and then FTX as engines to make money that could then be given to various altruistic endeavors, in line with Bankman-Fried's embrace of the philosophy known as ""effective altruism.""

The filing describes him as a ""shy"" child who ""often struggled socially,"" who in high school ""realized he was anhedonic, or unable to experience joy or pleasure.""

""As Sam describes it, he experiences negative emotions in ways that are not very different from many other people — neither much more extreme, nor much less negative. But he does not feel pleasure, or happiness, or joy, even when something very good happens to him,"" the filing says.

""In college, he was officially diagnosed as suffering from anhedonic depression and he has been on antidepressant medication ever since.""

The lawyers wrote that Bankman-Fried has a ""neurodiversity"" that ""greatly affects how he perceives and is perceived.""

The filing does not explicitly call Bankman-Fried autistic or say he is on the autism spectrum, but several times mentions his neurodiversity in connection with references to those terms.

""Neurodiversity is a medical concept that recognizes the variation in human neurology. It acknowledges that neurological differences, such as those associated with Asperger's, ASD, and [Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder] are part of the spectrum of diversity of the human brain that exists,"" the filing says.

""Sam's condition manifests in a wide variety of ways. No two individuals on the spectrum are exactly alike. It is not a disease or a condition that needs to be cured,"" the lawyers wrote. ""Instead, it is a fundamental aspect of an individual's identity—an aspect to be considered at sentencing.""

The filing says that because of his condition, ""Sam is uniquely vulnerable in a prison population.""

""Individuals with ASD are often at considerably greater risk of physical harm and extortion in prison than other inmates,"" the lawyers wrote.

The attorneys argued that Bankman-Fried is ""not at risk of committing further crimes,"" and had already been harshly punished by the poor conditions in the Brooklyn, New York, federal jail where he has been locked up since last summer.

The filing urged the judge to sentence Bankman-Fried along the lines of the sentence imposed on so-called junk bond king Michael Milken, who received a 10-year term for the fraud he committed at the investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert in the 1980s, but only ended up serving two years behind bars.

""Milken was released from custody at an age when he was young enough to still make a positive impact,"" the lawyers argued. ""And he became a tremendous force for good in the world.""

""Milken's two-year sentence gave him a second chance. He has changed the lives of countless others for the better with that chance,"" the filing said.

""Given the same chance, Sam would dedicate his post-prison life to charitable works, finding the best ways to help others, and put them into practice, consistent with his commitment to effective altruism.""

590,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/14/top-wall-street-analysts-recommend-these-stocks-for-dividend-oriented-investors.html,WMB,Williams Companies,Top Wall Street analysts recommend these stocks for dividend-oriented investors,"Eric Greager, President and CEO of Civitas Resources, at the NYSE, November 9, 2021.

As investors confront uncertain markets in the short term, dividend paying stocks could offer some portfolio stability and income.

Analysts have dug into the details on dividend-paying stocks, analyzing companies' fundamentals and understanding their long-term growth potential.

With that in mind, here are three attractive dividend stocks, according to Wall Street's top experts on TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Civitas Resources

First, there is independent oil and natural gas producer Civitas Resources (CIVI). The company is focused on developing assets in the Permian and Denver-Julesburg basins.

Civitas paid a quarterly dividend of $1.59 per share on December 29, 2023. This payment included a base dividend of $0.50 per share and a variable dividend of $1.09 per share.

Earlier this month, Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar upgraded Civitas stock to buy from hold with a price target of $86 per share. The analyst called the stock one of his top picks in the U.S. oil and gas space. The analyst thinks that 2023 was a transformative year for the company, with three major acquisitions in the Permian Basin reshaping its asset base.

Kumar added that these recent acquisitions extended the duration of the company's overall inventory to nearly 10 years, making it more competitive than its small and mid-cap exploration and production rivals. He also highlighted that the CIVI offers the highest cash returns compared to its peers.

Despite these positives, the stock still trades at a major discount to its peers on FCF/EV and EV/EBITDAX (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation or depletion, amortization, and exploration expense) basis.

""We think this relative valuation gap is too wide considering the vastly improved asset base and expanded inventory duration,"" said Kumar.

Kumar ranks No. 224 among more than 8,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 60% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 15.5%. (See Civitas Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks)

Williams Companies

We move to another energy dividend stock – Williams Companies (WMB). The energy infrastructure company handles about one-third of the natural gas shipped in the U.S.

On Dec. 26, 2023, the company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.4475 per share. This dividend marked a 5.3% year-over-year growth. WMB offers a dividend yield of 5.1%.

Williams recently acquired a portfolio of natural gas storage assets from Hartree Partners LP's affiliate for $1.95 billion. Stifel analyst Selman Akyol expects this acquisition, which includes six natural gas facilities, to be favorable, given the acquired assets' access to LNG export facilities.

The analyst thinks that the deal will enhance the company's storage to cater to the growing LNG demand. Additionally, the analyst noted that this acquisition would place the company in a better position to provide fuel for standby power plants amid the transition to renewables.

Akyol reiterated a buy rating on WMB stock with a price target of $40, saying, ""With a diversified gathering footprint and the largest U.S. long-haul natural gas pipeline in Transco, Williams' footprint should remain insulated from commodity price swings with over 90% fee-based margins.""

The analyst also highlighted the company's top-tier distribution coverage, investment grade balance sheet, attractive yield and the ability to generate stable cash flows despite macro challenges.

Akyol holds the 976th position among more than 8,600 analysts on TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 63% of the time, delivering a return of 4.2%, on average. (See Williams' Financial Statements on TipRanks.

Kimco Realty

Finally, we look at Kimco Realty (KIM), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that is focused on grocery-anchored shopping centers. In December 2023, the company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share, which reflected a 4.3% increase over the prior dividend payment. KIM's dividend yield stands at 4.7%.

Following Kimco Realty's recently completed acquisition of RPT Realty, Stifel analyst Simon Yarmak reaffirmed a buy rating on KIM stock and slightly increased the price target to $23 per share from $21.75 per share. The analyst noted that management is optimistic about an upside to occupancy levels in RPT's portfolio, margins, and a solid signed-not-opened (SNO) portfolio.

The analyst added that management is positive about the financial health of the company's tenants and thinks that its exposure to Rite Aid, which filed for bankruptcy in 2023, remains ""very muted.""

Yarmak remains bullish on Kimco Realty and thinks that the company's portfolio is stable and has significant size and scale in its target markets. He raised his 2024 FFO (funds from operations) per share estimate to $1.62 from $1.61 and 2025 estimate to $1.69 from $1.68. The analyst expects 2023 FFO of $1.57 per share.

""KIM is focused on executing on the value creation opportunities within its portfolio to drive NOI [net operating income] and cash flow growth,"" said Yarmak, explaining his investment stance.

Yarmak ranks No. 410 among more than 8,600 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, with each delivering an average return of 9.7%.

Fueling the brain is key for focus, clarity, and optimal functioning throughout the day. Even if you happen to follow intermittent fasting, it's important to pick something nourishing at the start of your eating window.

Today, most people in the U.S. associate breakfast with colorful cereals, overloaded bagels and breakfast sandwiches, baked goods that border on dessert, and coffee drinks that are barely distinguishable from milkshakes.

These popular items are frequently loaded with sugars and simple carbohydrates that cause an initial spike in blood sugar followed by a crash. They also contribute to the neuroinflammation (inflammation around the brain) that's associated with brain fog and poor concentration.

Fortunately, as the Director of Nutritional, Lifestyle and Metabolic Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, my research and clinical work has helped me learn that there are plenty of other options for your morning routine that can help enhance your mental fitness.

594,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/01/how-a-psychologist-stops-overthinking-everything.html,XYL,Xylem Inc.,A psychologist shares the 5 exercises she does to 'stop overthinking everything',"As a clinical psychologist, I've spent 14 years teaching people how to regulate their emotions and cope with difficult situations. One of the biggest issues my clients struggle with is overthinking. It's an exhausting habit that can turn a stressful challenge into even more anxiety. Here are five things I do when I need to stop overthinking everything:

1. Recognize when I tend to overthink

The first and most important step is pattern recognition. What times of the day do you get lost in your worries? Do you notice physical signs, like clenching your jaw? Are there negative themes that come up again and again in your head? Then reflect on when you are less prone to rumination, even when something difficult happens. You might worry less when you go to the gym after work, or when you listen to a funny podcast on your commute. Arming yourself with these details can help you be prepared with strategies as soon as you notice the warning signs.

2. Get some distance from myself

A big reason why overthinking when you are upset backfires is because it immerses you even more in whatever you're going through. The next time you notice yourself sinking into fruitless rumination, try to see the bigger picture. This strategy is called ""self-distancing."" Observe whatever difficult experience you are ruminating about as if you were a fly on the wall, rather than directly involved. Taking a step back can provide the perspective you need to feel like you can change the channel.

3. Swap 'why' with 'how'

The simplest way to replace negative thoughts with more constructive thinking is to shift from asking ""why"" questions (""why me?"") to ""how"" questions (""how can I move forward?""). Notice the difference: ""Why"" is a dead end, while ""how"" leads to action. If you went on a date, for example, and the person didn't message you after what seemed like a great time, rather than ponder why, focus on how you can create a relaxing night for yourself. By doing this, you consciously shift from unproductive ruminating to empowered planning.

4. Write it out

When you need to process your feelings or an experience, instead of overthinking, practice expressive writing. Try this exercise over the course of three days: Day 1: Spend 15 to 20 minutes writing about the stress and trauma that is plaguing you.

Day 2: Write about how the experience has affected you.

Day 3: Describe how the experience relates to your current life and what you want for the future. This practice has been shown to help reduce symptoms of depression, even weeks or months later. Researchers say it's because writing can help you go deeper into your emotions, while also creating some distance and an end point.

5. Reschedule overthinking

To make your overthinking feel less compulsive, consciously postpone it until later. Give yourself 10 minutes to ruminate about a problem at 7:00 p.m. every night, then move on. Another bonus is that there's a good chance that you'll get so caught up in your day or evening that you'll forget to return to your worries at the appointed time. When you are conscious of them, you'll be able to see your thoughts with more perspective. You want to avoid the debilitating all-day background buzz of rumination. Instead, turn your overthinking into something more contained, and give yourself some freedom and power back. Jennifer L.

If you want to understand how different the human and animal medicine and vaccine industries have historically been, you don't need to look much further than weight loss drugs. On the human side, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly struggled to meet the demand for Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound, respectively, since introducing them, as the popularity of these diabetes and weight loss treatment drugs surged in 2023. Other drug makers, like Pfizer and AstraZeneca , have outlined their strategies for getting into a market that could be worth tens of billions of dollars in the next decade, while small pharmaceutical companies are trying to grab a share in what has become the hottest part of health care. Comparatively, the first medication designed to combat obesity in dogs was ultimately pulled from the market in 2014 due to lack of interest. ""I think I had one of the only dogs that was on it, and I'm going to make myself sound really bad when I explain why,"" said Zoetis CEO Kristin Peck, named CEO in 2020 and named to the inaugural CNBC Changemakers list on Wednesday. ""I don't think a lot of people wanted to get their dogs weight loss drugs because if your dog is overweight, you have to admit that the reason is probably you're not walking it and are feeding it too much.""

As the saying goes, dogs, and pets in general, have long been viewed as man's best friend. But pet pharmaceuticals haven't always matched that, and often a tick or flea collar was the lone preventive medicine many pets saw, outside of necessary vet visits. But Peck said she has seen a shift in mentality from pet owners, as well as a shift in the pharmaceutical pipeline, that is bringing animal medicine more in line with human medicine. ""Newer generations see their pets very differently than previous generations,"" Peck said. ""Fifty, sixty years ago, your dog was in the backyard; now it has moved into your house, often your bed and sometimes replaced your children — your dog or cat has a stroller, a backpack and an outfit."" When Pfizer spun off its animal health business in 2013 creating Zoetis, about 65% of the company's business was livestock-related. That has flipped now, with 64% of the company's revenue coming from products for companion animals like cats and dogs. Peck has kept the company's emphasis on innovation, developing products in pet categories that didn't previously exist. For example, the company had more than $1.3 billion in revenue from dermatology-related dog and cat drugs in 2022, compared to less than $1 million from products in that same category in 2013. The company's top product in that category is Apoquel, which is designed to treat dogs who suffer from allergic itches and dermatitis. ""When we said we were going to have dermatology, [the reaction] was that dogs don't need dermatology, they take some Benadryl if they itch,"" Peck said. ""But we said we think we can create a market, and to now have over $1.3 billion in dermatology sales, if I told you that was even remotely possible five or six years ago you would have said that was crazy."" Peck credits the Pfizer spinoff for allowing Zoetis to better balance what the company wanted to do in animal health versus the human health side. ""We only have one customer, and we are only thinking about that every day and with every dollar we spend, whether that's on R&D, commercial or manufacturing,"" she said. This approach has led to the next product that Zoetis and Peck are betting on to become a $1 billion franchise: the treatment of osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats.

In May, the FDA approved Librela, which is a monoclonal antibody treatment that can provide long-term control of OA pain symptoms in dogs, improving their mobility and overall quality of life. According to Zoetis, 40% of dogs have signs of OA, which can make it difficult for them to go up or down stairs, a hesitation to jump, limping after exercise and becoming more withdrawn. A similar product was approved for cats, marking the first time that monoclonal antibody treatments, which have become increasingly popular for treating human illnesses, have been used to treat pet osteoarthritis pain. ""You can't make a monoclonal antibody for dogs in a human health facility, so you have to be willing to outlay capital during clinical trials, and that's a bold, large capital decision,"" Peck said. ""We've demonstrated that pet owners will pay if you find a product that has value."" While Zoetis is focused on bridging that gap between human and animal health products, Peck said the company is also aiming to tackle some of the unique differences, like the diagnosis process. ""People with osteoarthritis, they go to the doctor, they get medication so they can live a healthier, longer and a better quality of life,"" Peck said. ""But if my hip is killing me but no one knows that because I don't have a limp, it's like the assumption that your dog doesn't have osteoarthritis because it's not limping."" In June 2022, Zoetis spent more than $50 million to acquire pet care genetics company Basepaws, which produces DNA testing for dogs and cats focused on health and early detection of disease risks. ""You're going to be able to extend life by looking at genetics and biomarkers to run diagnostics,"" Peck said. ""We'll be able to get better at predicting, which will massively improve the quality of life of animals who can't speak and can't tell you they're feeling some of the things that they are."" Artificial intelligence is helping with that as well. Cats generally get less medical care than dogs due to the difficulty many owners face in bringing them to the vet, Peck said, so Zoetis has invested in AI technology that will allow cat owners to record their cat's movements, upload those videos and have AI analyze it to see if the cat is dealing with any osteoarthritis issues. Peck said Zoetis will remain focused on innovative approaches to animal health, taking some queues from human health but also forging its own path to deal with the unique challenges that come from taking care of cats and dogs. Unlike 2014, could there now be an Ozempic for dogs and cats that works? Peck said while the company continues to explore GLP-1s to treat pet diabetes, weight loss is not a current area of focus. Challenges related to cardiology, oncology and kidney disease are the highest priorities. ""We recognize the success this class of medications has had in human health. In terms of treating pet obesity, our work with genetic markers could yield a more targeted opportunity for a treatment that could be effective for pets and a solution pet owners would value,"" she said. ""A lot of the same technologies will work from humans to animals. And from animals to humans.""",2/28/2024,0,0.869362354,0.015913645,0.00197071,0.105904661,0.006089979,0.000758657

Here are the others,"After significantly outperforming the broader market this year, shares of General Electric could see a pullback, at least according to one popular chart metric. Stocks have continued their upward march this week as the Federal Reserve left rates unchanged and maintained that cuts are coming this year. The major U.S. averages are on pace to end the week higher, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average on track for its best week since December. The S & P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are both pacing for weekly gains of more than 2%. Using the CNBC Pro Stock Screener tool, we searched for the most overbought and oversold names in the S & P 500 based on their 14-day relative strength index, or RSI. Stocks with an RSI above 70 are considered overbought and may be at risk of falling, while a reading below 30 suggests a stock may be oversold and could be a buying opportunity. Here are some of the most overbought names: General Electric 's 14-day RSI of nearly 83 indicates that shares could be overbought. The company is days away from its final spinoff, in which GE will jettison its power business. On April 2 , the entity will begin trading as GE Vernova on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker ""GEV,"" and investors are hoping the move will unlock more shareholder value . According to LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv, analysts still have a consensus buy rating on the stock, but think shares could lose 2.1% based on their average price target. The stock has climbed 38% since the start of the year. The GE Vernova spinoff will mark the final part of the company's process to break up its operations into three parts: health care, aviation and energy. Several oil and gas names are also overbought, according to their RSI. Valero Energy and Marathon Petroleum each have an RSI of roughly 84, while Marathon Oil and NRG Energy both have an RSI of more than 86. Each of these names are still buy-rated, according to analysts polled by LSEG. Analysts foresee declines for NRG, Valero and Marathon Petroleum, based on their consensus price targets. However, Wall Street anticipates nearly 17% upside for Marathon Oil, according to LSEG. Wells Fargo analyst Roger Read recently kept his overweight rating but upped his price target by $4 to $36 a share, saying lower material costs, faster drilling and well completion efficiencies should lead to lower costs throughout the year, mitigating inflationary pressures for oil companies. Here are the most oversold stocks in the S & P 500: Buy-rated drug company Zoetis could gain a whopping 32.6% over the next 12 months, according to analysts' average price target, per LSEG. The stock has an RSI of nearly 27, and it has slipped nearly 15% in 2024. Zoetis, a former Pfizer subsidiary that produces medicine and vaccinations for animals, last month reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share that fell short of analysts' expectations.

CNBC received 720 nominations and has spent the past several months, with guidance from the Changemakers Advisory Board, evaluating the applicants' impact through both quantitative and qualitative lenses, with a particular focus on their accomplishments during the past year.

The inaugural class of 2024 Changemakers spans 17 sectors. Leading the way are health care, with 22%; tech, with 14%; and consumer products and financial services, tied at 10%. It includes 15 startup CEOs and founders whose companies have a total valuation of more than $47 billion, and 11 public company CEOs overseeing firms with a combined market cap of about $170 billion. In addition, it features five women deploying technology to amplify the philanthropic impact of their organizations and four women shaking up the world of sports business. Nearly one-fifth of the women are based outside the U.S.

Each has accomplished a meaningful achievement in 2023, propelling a major business to a new level of growth and often tackling issues of significant importance to society.

Anat Ashkenazi, the CFO of pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, secured key manufacturing capacity at the dawn of a blockbuster weight-loss drug era and worked to lower the prices for insulin drugs amid heightened political scrutiny of prescription costs. RePurpose Global CEO and co-founder Svanika Balasubramanian is working to minimize and repurpose plastic waste alongside hundreds of consumer brands. Bobbie CEO Laura Modi has taken on the baby formula shortage with a new product, while Baby2Baby co-CEOs Norah Weinstein and Kelly Sawyer Patricof are upending the status quo in diaper manufacturing and distribution.

In some cases, Changemakers are taking their star power to build out new market opportunities. Alex Cooper is changing the podcast business and building a new kind of audio media empire. Actor Tracee Ellis Ross is changing the hair-care industry and more with Pattern Beauty. Naomi Osaka is shaking things up both on the tennis court and off with her media company and skincare line.

In reviewing the Changemakers, CNBC identified a couple of key trends. First, this new generation of women leaders is aligning purpose and profits, creating businesses that succeed when they achieve environmental or social good. At rePurpose Global, Balasubramanian created a model that succeeds when companies take steps to reduce their plastic production and environmental impact. Jessica Chang, the CEO of Upwards, is reimagining the business of child care to make it more widely accessible and affordable. Maayan Cohen created Hello Heart to help individuals manage cardiovascular health, while helping employers manage costs.",2/28/2024,0,0.001332474,0.992659271,0.001126321,0.003007555,0.001225753,0.000648742
598,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/10/5-things-next-week-that-could-determine-if-wall-street-win-streak-continues.html,ZTS,Zoetis,5 things next week that could determine if Wall Street's winning streak continues,"Wall Street wrapped up another positive week, with the S & P 500 closing Friday above 5,000 for the first time ever. The Nasdaq finished less than 0.5% away from its November 2021 record-high close. It was another big week for Club company earnings, with Estee Lauder , Eli Lilly , GE Healthcare , DuPont , Linde , Ford , Disney and Wynn Resorts all reporting. Twenty-one of our 32 portfolio names have now delivered their results this quarter. Looking more broadly, according to FactSet, three-quarters of the 67% of S & P 500 companies that have issued their numbers reported upside earnings surprises, while just about two-thirds reported better-than-expected revenue. It was a pretty light week in terms of economic data releases, though we did get a favorable ISM Services number on Monday. Things will pick up next week with several closely watched macroeconomic updates, including two key government inflation reports. While no Club earnings are scheduled to report earnings in the week ahead, 61 companies in the S & P 500 will deliver their latest quarterly results. 1. Consumer inflation: The main event of the week will come on Tuesday when the January consumer price index (CPI) is released. Economists are looking for headline CPI to advance 2.9% year over year and core CPI, including food and energy prices, to gain 3.8%. While the core PCE (personal consumption expenditure) price index is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, CPI will provide valuable insight into what areas of the economy are seeing sticker price pressures. That, in turn, can help forecast whether there's any chance for a March interest rate cut. Right now, the market odds favor a Fed rate reduction in May or June. A cooler core CPI print, closer to the Fed's 2% target inflation rate, would likely be taken as a positive by the stock market. Really weak data could be less well received on the thought the Fed held rates high for too long. We, however, do not believe the latter to be the case. 2. Wholesale inflation: The January producer price index (PPI) is out on Friday. Economists are looking for a year-over-year headline PPI increase of 0.6%. The CPI carries more weight because it reflects the prices consumers pay. Price stability and maximizing employment are the two pillars of the Fed's dual mandate. However, PPI is important because it provides insight into input costs that companies pay. A greater-than-expected rise in input costs could lead to companies trying to protect profits by passing those higher costs through to consumers, which would be a negative in terms of getting the rate of inflation down. 3. Retail sales: January retail sales are on Thursday. While this report doesn't provide nearly as much insight into the rate of inflation as CPI, it is a gauge of consumer health. That's because nearly 70% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), or economic growth, is based on private consumption. If the economy is going to avoid a recession (and we think it will), we need to see consumer spending and shopping remain relatively resilient. Economists are expecting a 0.1% monthly decline, not too surprising given the comp for a January monthly reading is December, which is the last month of the holiday shopping season. 4. Other data: January's industrial production and capacity utilization report is also released on Thursday, and the January housing starts and building permits report is out on Friday. The former will provide insight into the state of manufacturing, which provides indirect insight into the health of consumer and business demand. The latter, however, is likely to garner more attention as an ongoing shortage of houses remains a key factor keeping prices high. Shelter costs are a real thorn in the Fed's side because they represent large, unavoidable cost for Americans. Anything that points to more housing supply coming online should be taken as a positive. 5. Earnings: We get a break from Club earnings next week. But things will pick back up for our portfolio names the following week. That's when Palo Alto Networks , Nvidia , Coterra Energ y and Bausch Health report. However, between now and then, there are tons of releases from non-portfolio companies to monitor for a better understanding of industry dynamics and the economy overall. As important as macroeconomic updates are, they're backward-looking and extremely high-level. Earnings releases, on the other, hand provide more up-to-date information. The reported numbers may be backward-looking but the information management teams share on their post-earnings conference calls are real-time and often provide insight as to what is currently happening on the ground.
