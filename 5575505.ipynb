It also slightly reduces the amount of cash Musk needs to put up personally.\\nCNBC reported that Musk is expected to serve as temporary chief executive of Twitter for a \\\"few months,\\\" after he completes the deal.\\nSaudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman of the board at Kingdom Holding Co., made the biggest contribution, agreeing to commit almost 35 million shares in Twitter -- worth $1.9 billion -- to retain a stake in the company after Musk's takeover, according to an amended securities filing Thursday morning.\\nEllison, the co-founder of Oracle Corp. who has a big stake in Tesla and a seat on its board, committed $1 billion through his trust.\\nOther investors named in the filing Thursday include the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance Holdings Ltd., Brookfield Asset Management, Fidelity Management & Research and Qatar Holding.\\nChangpeng Zhao, chief executive of Binance, which promised $500 million, tweeted that it was \\\"a small contribution to the cause.\\\"\\nWith the financing picture becoming clearer, the market seems to be coming around to the idea that the deal will close.\\nThe gap between Twitter's stock price and the $54.20 per share that Musk offered to pay for the company is at its narrowest point since April 26. Twitter shares rose 2.7% to $50.36 on Thursday.\\nThe deal is set to close later this year, and the two sides have each agreed to pay a $1-billion breakup fee if it falls apart.\\nThe world's wealthiest person reached an agreement April 25 to acquire Twitter using a financing plan that has alarmed some Tesla investors.\\nIn addition to pledging tens of billions of dollars' worth of his Tesla shares to support margin loans, Musk vowed to line up some $21 billion of equity.\\nThat number has risen to $27.25 billion, according to Thursday's filing. Musk has sold more than $8.5 billion of Tesla stock to finance the deal.\\n\\\"In this game of high stakes poker, Ellison and the impressive list of backers will remove more of an overhang from Tesla shares as the Musk leverage of shares now becomes less onerous,\\\" said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush. \\\"This was a smart financial and strategic move by Musk that will be well received across the board.\\\"\\nMusk's latest backers include a bevy of traditional asset managers, venture capital firms, boutique hedge funds and one of the world's largest pools of capital.\\nQatar Holding, a unit of the nation's wealth fund, has agreed to commit $375 million.\\nAlwaleed previously rejected Musk's bid, stating that it failed to come \\\"close to the intrinsic value of Twitter.\\\"\\nMusk is also in discussions with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey on contributing some of his shares toward the acquisition.\\nEllison, 77, is the richest person in the group besides Musk. The corporate software titan has a net worth of $95.6 billion, placing him 11th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\\nHe's not an active Twitter user -- his only tweet was a decade ago -- but he does share some of Musk's political views. Ellison is a major Republican donor and hosted a fundraiser for former President Trump in 2020.\\nSilicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who has publicly feuded with Dorsey on Twitter, has agreed to commit $400 million via his fund Andreessen Horowitz, known as a16z. Fellow venture firm Sequoia Capital is putting up $800 million.\\nBen Horowitz, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, cited the work of Twitter founders Evan Williams and Dorsey as a reason the firm invested.\\n\\\"We believe in EV and Jack's vision to connect the world and we believe in Elon's brilliance to finally make it what it was meant to be,\\\" Horowitz said.\\nSeveral Tesla investors are among those committing support for Musk's Twitter bid, including Ellison, who owns 1.45% of the carmaker's outstanding shares, and Fidelity Management & Research Co., which owns about 1%. Both are among Tesla's biggest investors.\\nSmaller investors include Witkoff Capital, real estate tycoon Steven Witkoff's firm, and Cartenna Capital, a hedge fund set up by Peter Avellone, a former Millennium Management portfolio manager.\\nMusk had been building up a stake in Twitter since early this year, eventually amassing more than 9% of the company and becoming its largest individual shareholder.\\nHe was offered a seat on the board, which he turned down because of the restrictions it would have placed on him for buying more shares. Instead, he made a formal offer for Twitter on April 14, subject to financing that wasn't immediately spelled out.\\nWith more than 90 million followers on Twitter, Musk is one of the platform's most prominent and outspoken users.\\nHe is known for sometimes cryptic or mysterious tweets, lobbed at all hours of the day, on topics as diverse as cryptocurrencies, space travel and whether Twitter should have an edit button.\\nSome of the ideas he has thrown out for Twitter include that it limit advertising, open-source its algorithm and do more to emphasize free-speech principles.\\nCaption: PHOTO: ORACLE CO-FOUNDER Larry Ellison, above in 2019, is among investors who agreed to bankroll the Twitter deal. He committed $1 billion through his trust.\\nPHOTOGRAPHER:Justin Sullivan Getty Images\\nCredit: Turner and Chan write for Bloomberg.\",\n          \"Elon Musk will no longer join the board of Twitter, just days after the company announced his appointment.\\nThe rapid U-turn was quickly reflected in the share price movement as the social-media company's stock fell more than 4% in premarket trading Monday.\\nInvestors hoping that Musk's influence at a board level would bring about change were clearly disappointed. But it's far from the end of the story. Musk remains Twitter's largest shareholder after taking a 9.2% stake, and he hasn't been shy when it comes to raising potential changes to the platform, even if some have been on the jokey side.\\nBut his sudden decision, announced by Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and, oddly, not by the man himself, does cast doubt on where the billionaire's journey with the social-media giant will end up. Agrawal stated the board appointment was contingent on a background check and \\\"formal acceptance,\\\" adding that Musk informed the company on Saturday he would no longer be joining the board.\\nAs for Musk, his intentions have never been that clear, although a poll on removing the edit button and posts about free speech have offered clues.\\nBut the stock, which surged 27% on its best ever day last week , is still around 13% higher than it was before Musk disclosed his stake, even factoring in Monday's early fall.\\nRegardless of his next move, or the level of influence he might have, the Tesla CEO's very presence as Twitter's largest shareholder will keep management on its toes. Investors want the company's financial results to be in line with the chirpiness of its leading shareholder.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Callum Keown\\n*** Join Barron's senior managing editor Lauren R.

He's taking a poll asking whether to delete the \\\"w\\\" in the word Twitter, and as of 11:45 p.m. Sunday, 51% have voted yes, while 49% have voted \\\"of course.\\\" Those were the only options.\\n* He also put out a poll asking whether to convert Twitter's San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter \\\"since no one shows up anyway.\\\" So far, the yes vote has 91.3%, and the no vote has 8.7%.\\n* Musk proposed giving authentication check marks to everyone who signs up for Twitter Blue, a monthly subscription that offers premium features and the ability to customize an individual's experience. They would be different from the check marks for verified accounts or public figures.\\n* Musk also agreed with a user who suggested subscriptions should be cheaper in less affluent countries, saying the cost \\\"should be proportionate to affordability,\\\" Axios reported. \\\"Maybe even an option to pay in Doge?\\\" he mused, referring to the Dogecoin cryptocurrency.\\nWhat's Next: Late Sunday, Agrawal tweeted that Musk told the company on Saturday he wouldn't be joining the board. \\\"I believe this is for the best,\\\" Agrawal said, adding the company remains open to Musk's input as its biggest shareholder.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Janet H.

Aleksandr Dvornikov was named to run operations in Ukraine, but that won't erase Russia's record there, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN Sunday. \\\"This general will just be another author of crimes and brutality against Ukrainian civilians.\\\"\\n* Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba told NBC that the U.S. has provided heavy air-defense systems and is helping Ukraine get additional weapons from other countries. \\\"You provide us with everything that we need, and we fight so that you don't have to.\\\"\\n* Sullivan said he and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley spent two hours on the phone with the Ukrainian Armed Forces chief making plans to deliver all the weapons Ukraine wants to strengthen Ukraine's position on the battlefield and at the bargaining table.\\n* U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Kyiv over the weekend and talked to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Sullivan told NBC that Biden isn't currently planning a trip there.\\nWhat's Next: Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said that Finland's Parliament will discuss possible NATO membership \\\"within the coming weeks\\\" with talks that could wrap up \\\"before midsummer.\\\" Finland shares an 800-mile border with Russia.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Janet H.

The Journal reported that far-right former TV pundit \\u00c3\\u0089ric Zemmour, who won 7.3% of the estimated vote, has encouraged his supporters to back Le Pen.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Rupert Steiner and Jack Denton\\n***\\nAirlines Curb Flights Ahead of Summer Travel Surge\\nAirlines are trimming flight schedules as they hire more workers, aiming to avoid the headaches of last summer's travel rebound. To prepare for the travel surge, carriers hired more pilots, flight attendants, gate agents, ramp workers, and customer-service representatives, The Wall Street Journal reported.\\n* JetBlue, which grappled with another weekend of flight delays and cancellations, told workers it will cut capacity 8% to 10% in May and by similar levels through the summer even as it braces for a wave of travel demand.\\n* While JetBlue has hired 3,000 more workers, it is still short-staffed. It is competing with Frontier to buy Spirit Airlines. \\\"Based on your feedback that the schedule is wound too tight, we know the best plan is to reduce capacity now,\\\" JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty told staff.\\n* American Airlines hired more than 600 pilots and is focused on supply-chain issues such as catering. Alaska Air Group, Delta Air Lines, and American pilots have picketed in recent weeks, complaining about flight schedules leaving pilots overworked and fatigued, the Journal reported.\\n* Storms in Florida earlier in April forced flight attendants to wait hours for transportation and hotels, and some slept in airports, unions that represent American and Southwest Airlines flight attendants said. Southwest said it is working to improve its contingency planning.\\nWhat's Next: JetBlue is offering $1,000 bonuses to flight attendants who don't call out of work through May 31 and an extra $100 a trip for working on their days off. Southwest raised starting pay to $17 an hour and waived requirements that workers have high school diplomas.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Janet H. Cho\\n***\\nBank Earnings Expected to Reveal Effects of Market Volatility\\nBank earnings are due for the volatile first quarter, when Russia's war on Ukraine began and threw markets and the financial businesses associated with them into disarray. Some banks have already detailed exposure to Russian assets held, but the fallout will likely extend to revenue from deal making and trading.\\n* Big banks are leaving Russia and face losses. Goldman Sachs' credit exposure there was $650 million at the end of 2021, and JPMorgan has said exiting Russia could cost it $1 billion. Citigroup could lose $4 billion.\\n* Equity capital markets, a business that includes initial public offerings, is expected to be weak. Dealogic says revenue is down 75% from the same period last year and 61% from the quarter ending in December. Merger volumes have fallen by one-third the robust level of last year.\\n* Stock trading results could also be blunted, but commodities and currency trading may help offset that. The price of U.S. benchmark crude oil is up 30% so far this year.\\n* JPMorgan kicks off the week on Wednesday, with expected earnings per share of $2.72, while Goldman and Wells Fargo among others come Thursday, with EPS expected to be $8.95 and 82 cents, respectively.\\nWhat's Next: Banks benefit when interest rates rise because they can charge more interest on loans without immediately raising the rates they pay on deposits. The Federal Reserve's meeting in May, when many expect it to bump up rates a half-point, could be a catalyst for bank stocks.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Liz Moyer\\n***\\nMarketWatch Wants to Hear From You\\nWhen does a solo 401(k) make sense for self-employed people, and what are the contribution limits?\\nA MarketWatch correspondent will answer this question soon.

What It Means for the Stock. \\n\",\n          \"The billionaire's surprise move came months after he tried to back out of a $44 billion deal to acquire the company.The monthslong battle over Elon Musk's bid to buy Twitter has been massive in scale and drama. One of the tech industry's biggest deals in recent years, it has captured the public's imagination, with cinematic twists that have been closely followed even by people who have never written a tweet.Now Mr. Musk, in a surprise move, has added another plot turn. After months of trying to get out of a deal that he struck in April, the billionaire made a proposal on Monday night that could bring the acrimonious legal fight to an end.Mr. Musk said he would do exactly what he said he would do in April: Acquire Twitter at $54.20 per share, according to regulatory filings made public on Tuesday.Twitter, which sued Mr. Musk in July to force him to go through with the $44 billion deal, has yet to accept his new proposal and plans to add conditions to try to ensure that he doesn't change his mind again.In a short statement, Twitter said it had received Mr. Musk's letter and reiterated the company's intention to close the deal. Twitter may ask a court in Delaware, where it filed its suit, for protections that would force Mr. Musk to follow through with his new proposal, said three people familiar with the company's plans, who were not authorized to speak publicly about them. The company could also demand that Mr. Musk pay interest on the deal price for the delays in completing the acquisition, one of those people added.A deal would allow both sides to avoid a messy trial that was expected to start in two weeks in Delaware Chancery Court. The trial most likely would have featured testimony from Mr. Musk, who runs the electric automaker Tesla, and senior Twitter executives. Mr. Musk is scheduled to be deposed on Thursday and Friday in Austin, Texas, according to a legal filing.Twitter has barely been profitable for most of its history and is dwarfed in size by other social media platforms like Facebook and the much younger TikTok. But the fight with Mr. Musk has preoccupied Silicon Valley, Wall Street and Washington because Twitter has for years been an online bullhorn for opinionated tech industry billionaires like Mr. Musk and politicians like former President Donald J. Trump, whom the company barred from its platform last year after the Jan. 6 riot on Capitol Hill.If Mr. Musk does take over Twitter, one of his first big moves could be allowing Mr. Trump to return. Mr. Musk has said it was a \\\"mistake\\\" for Twitter to bar Mr. Trump.The potential agreement follows months of disputes that have created existential challenges for Twitter, cratering its share price, demoralizing its employees and spooking the advertisers it relies on for revenue.Mr. Musk, with his repeated, scathing criticism of Twitter and its management, has often seemed more interested in taking a wrecking ball to the company than becoming its new owner. His critics have argued that he has simply been looking for anything to justify backing out of a rash decision that he quickly came to regret.\\\"I think he recognized that litigation is not going well on his part,\\\" said Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at Tulane Law School.A deal at the original price would be a victory for Twitter. Mr. Musk declared in July that he no longer intended to continue with the acquisition because he believed Twitter's service was overrun by spam. Twitter sued him soon after.Mr. Musk submitted his latest proposal to Twitter on Monday evening, informing the company that he intended to proceed with his original offer. \\\"We write to notify you that the Musk parties intend to proceed to closing of the transaction,\\\" a lawyer for Mr. Musk wrote in the letter, according to a regulatory filing. The letter asked that the court battle be paused, pending the closing of the deal.The two sides met in court in an emergency virtual hearing on Tuesday to discuss the proposal before Kathaleen McCormick, the judge overseeing the trial. The proposal was reported earlier by Bloomberg.Lawyers for Mr. Musk and Twitter were expected to meet again in court later on Tuesday to discuss next steps, the person said. If they opt to proceed with the sale of Twitter, a deal could possibly close within weeks, or as soon as Mr. Musk hands over the $44 billion.Twitter may request that Mr. Musk agree to have the court supervise the deal's closing, three people familiar with the matter said. The company may also ask Mr. Musk to pay a daily interest fee for every day that has passed since shareholders approved the deal on Sept. 13, one of those people said.\\\"Procedurally, Twitter has done everything they need to do to close this deal,\\\" said Brian J.M. Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School. If the company accepts Mr. Musk's proposal, it could request that the trial be postponed until the deal is completed, Mr. Quinn said. Once the acquisition is completed, Twitter will most likely dismiss its lawsuit against Mr. Musk.On Tuesday evening, Mr. Musk tweeted that \\\"buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.\\\" X is the name of holding company that Mr. Musk formed to buy Twitter.Shares in the social media company spiked more than 12 percent on the news of Mr. Musk's latest offer, before a halt in trading. Trading resumed in the afternoon, and Twitter's share price closed at $52, a 22 percent increase.The economic backdrop has changed significantly since Mr. Musk announced his intent to buy Twitter last spring. Amid inflation and geopolitical uncertainty, investors are facing the kinds of losses they haven't seen since 2009. That has also made it more difficult to finance deals.Investment banks, led by Morgan Stanley, have already agreed to help finance the deal with about $13 billion in debt. The banks remain on the hook until April, according to the terms of their contract.Mr. Musk has said he would finance the rest of the deal in cash. In April, he sold about $8.5 billion shares in Tesla to help fund the deal; in May, he said he had lined up about $7 billion in cash from an array of investors including the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and the tech mogul Larry Ellison. It was not immediately clear what commitments those investors had to Mr. Musk.In August, Mr. Musk sold an additional $7 billion worth of Tesla's stock in \\\"the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close and some equity partners don't come through,\\\" he wrote at the time.Twitter employees learned of Mr. Musk's proposal from media reports while participating in a companywide meeting about corporate plans for 2023 on Tuesday, reigniting confusion and speculation that have roiled Twitter's work force over the past six months, four employees said.Parag Agrawal, Twitter's chief executive, did not immediately address Mr. Musk's offer with employees, those people added. Sean Edgett, Twitter's general counsel, said in an email to employees on Tuesday afternoon, \\\"I will continue to keep you posted on significant updates, but in the meantime, thank you for your patience as we work through this on the legal side.\\\"On the internal Slack messaging system on Tuesday, employees discussed the implications for the company, their jobs and their stock compensation. In a channel with nearly 2,000 members that is used to joke about company news, some wondered what would happen if Twitter's board did not accept Mr. Musk's renewed offer. Some speculated that Twitter's stock would plummet, while another, referring to Mr. Musk, said the company would not have to be owned by \\\"a moron.\\\"While an agreement would signify an end to the uncertainty clouding Twitter's immediate future, Mr. Musk's plans for the company are not clear. He told investors before trying to back out of the deal that by 2025, he could get the company to 500 million daily users and revenue of $13.2 billion.Twitter and Mr. Musk were set for a showdown this month in a Delaware courtroom. The company argued in legal filings that Mr. Musk's reasons for abandoning the deal were smoke screens, and suggested that he had simply hoped for a lower price after stock market declines decreased his wealth.Mr. Musk said Twitter had most likely undercounted the amount of spam on its platform, making the company less valuable than he initially believed. He also cited whistle-blower claims from a former Twitter executive, who said the company had misled regulators about its security practices, as a reason to exit the deal.Ryan Mac contributed reporting.Ryan Mac contributed reporting.PhotographElon Musk, center, has agreed to acquire Twitter at $54.20 per share, the same price he agreed to in April before getting cold feet.

It also slightly reduces the amount of cash Musk needs to put up personally.\\nCNBC reported that Musk is expected to serve as temporary chief executive of Twitter for a \\\"few months,\\\" after he completes the deal.\\nSaudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman of the board at Kingdom Holding Co., made the biggest contribution, agreeing to commit almost 35 million shares in Twitter -- worth $1.9 billion -- to retain a stake in the company after Musk's takeover, according to an amended securities filing Thursday morning.\\nEllison, the co-founder of Oracle Corp. who has a big stake in Tesla and a seat on its board, committed $1 billion through his trust.\\nOther investors named in the filing Thursday include the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance Holdings Ltd., Brookfield Asset Management, Fidelity Management & Research and Qatar Holding.\\nChangpeng Zhao, chief executive of Binance, which promised $500 million, tweeted that it was \\\"a small contribution to the cause.\\\"\\nWith the financing picture becoming clearer, the market seems to be coming around to the idea that the deal will close.\\nThe gap between Twitter's stock price and the $54.20 per share that Musk offered to pay for the company is at its narrowest point since April 26. Twitter shares rose 2.7% to $50.36 on Thursday.\\nThe deal is set to close later this year, and the two sides have each agreed to pay a $1-billion breakup fee if it falls apart.\\nThe world's wealthiest person reached an agreement April 25 to acquire Twitter using a financing plan that has alarmed some Tesla investors.\\nIn addition to pledging tens of billions of dollars' worth of his Tesla shares to support margin loans, Musk vowed to line up some $21 billion of equity.\\nThat number has risen to $27.25 billion, according to Thursday's filing. Musk has sold more than $8.5 billion of Tesla stock to finance the deal.\\n\\\"In this game of high stakes poker, Ellison and the impressive list of backers will remove more of an overhang from Tesla shares as the Musk leverage of shares now becomes less onerous,\\\" said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush. \\\"This was a smart financial and strategic move by Musk that will be well received across the board.\\\"\\nMusk's latest backers include a bevy of traditional asset managers, venture capital firms, boutique hedge funds and one of the world's largest pools of capital.\\nQatar Holding, a unit of the nation's wealth fund, has agreed to commit $375 million.\\nAlwaleed previously rejected Musk's bid, stating that it failed to come \\\"close to the intrinsic value of Twitter.\\\"\\nMusk is also in discussions with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey on contributing some of his shares toward the acquisition.\\nEllison, 77, is the richest person in the group besides Musk. The corporate software titan has a net worth of $95.6 billion, placing him 11th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\\nHe's not an active Twitter user -- his only tweet was a decade ago -- but he does share some of Musk's political views. Ellison is a major Republican donor and hosted a fundraiser for former President Trump in 2020.\\nSilicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who has publicly feuded with Dorsey on Twitter, has agreed to commit $400 million via his fund Andreessen Horowitz, known as a16z. Fellow venture firm Sequoia Capital is putting up $800 million.\\nBen Horowitz, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, cited the work of Twitter founders Evan Williams and Dorsey as a reason the firm invested.\\n\\\"We believe in EV and Jack's vision to connect the world and we believe in Elon's brilliance to finally make it what it was meant to be,\\\" Horowitz said.\\nSeveral Tesla investors are among those committing support for Musk's Twitter bid, including Ellison, who owns 1.45% of the carmaker's outstanding shares, and Fidelity Management & Research Co., which owns about 1%. Both are among Tesla's biggest investors.\\nSmaller investors include Witkoff Capital, real estate tycoon Steven Witkoff's firm, and Cartenna Capital, a hedge fund set up by Peter Avellone, a former Millennium Management portfolio manager.\\nMusk had been building up a stake in Twitter since early this year, eventually amassing more than 9% of the company and becoming its largest individual shareholder.\\nHe was offered a seat on the board, which he turned down because of the restrictions it would have placed on him for buying more shares. Instead, he made a formal offer for Twitter on April 14, subject to financing that wasn't immediately spelled out.\\nWith more than 90 million followers on Twitter, Musk is one of the platform's most prominent and outspoken users.\\nHe is known for sometimes cryptic or mysterious tweets, lobbed at all hours of the day, on topics as diverse as cryptocurrencies, space travel and whether Twitter should have an edit button.\\nSome of the ideas he has thrown out for Twitter include that it limit advertising, open-source its algorithm and do more to emphasize free-speech principles.\\nCaption: PHOTO: ORACLE CO-FOUNDER Larry Ellison, above in 2019, is among investors who agreed to bankroll the Twitter deal.

But it's far from the end of the story. Musk remains Twitter's largest shareholder after taking a 9.2% stake, and he hasn't been shy when it comes to raising potential changes to the platform, even if some have been on the jokey side.\\nBut his sudden decision, announced by Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and, oddly, not by the man himself, does cast doubt on where the billionaire's journey with the social-media giant will end up. Agrawal stated the board appointment was contingent on a background check and \\\"formal acceptance,\\\" adding that Musk informed the company on Saturday he would no longer be joining the board.\\nAs for Musk, his intentions have never been that clear, although a poll on removing the edit button and posts about free speech have offered clues.\\nBut the stock, which surged 27% on its best ever day last week , is still around 13% higher than it was before Musk disclosed his stake, even factoring in Monday's early fall.\\nRegardless of his next move, or the level of influence he might have, the Tesla CEO's very presence as Twitter's largest shareholder will keep management on its toes.

They would be different from the check marks for verified accounts or public figures.\\n* Musk also agreed with a user who suggested subscriptions should be cheaper in less affluent countries, saying the cost \\\"should be proportionate to affordability,\\\" Axios reported. \\\"Maybe even an option to pay in Doge?\\\" he mused, referring to the Dogecoin cryptocurrency.\\nWhat's Next: Late Sunday, Agrawal tweeted that Musk told the company on Saturday he wouldn't be joining the board. \\\"I believe this is for the best,\\\" Agrawal said, adding the company remains open to Musk's input as its biggest shareholder.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Janet H.

Some banks have already detailed exposure to Russian assets held, but the fallout will likely extend to revenue from deal making and trading.\\n* Big banks are leaving Russia and face losses. Goldman Sachs' credit exposure there was $650 million at the end of 2021, and JPMorgan has said exiting Russia could cost it $1 billion. Citigroup could lose $4 billion.\\n* Equity capital markets, a business that includes initial public offerings, is expected to be weak. Dealogic says revenue is down 75% from the same period last year and 61% from the quarter ending in December. Merger volumes have fallen by one-third the robust level of last year.\\n* Stock trading results could also be blunted, but commodities and currency trading may help offset that. The price of U.S. benchmark crude oil is up 30% so far this year.\\n* JPMorgan kicks off the week on Wednesday, with expected earnings per share of $2.72, while Goldman and Wells Fargo among others come Thursday, with EPS expected to be $8.95 and 82 cents, respectively.\\nWhat's Next: Banks benefit when interest rates rise because they can charge more interest on loans without immediately raising the rates they pay on deposits. The Federal Reserve's meeting in May, when many expect it to bump up rates a half-point, could be a catalyst for bank stocks.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Liz Moyer\\n***\\nMarketWatch Wants to Hear From You\\nWhen does a solo 401(k) make sense for self-employed people, and what are the contribution limits?\\nA MarketWatch correspondent will answer this question soon.

What It Means for the Stock. \\n\",\n          \"The billionaire's surprise move came months after he tried to back out of a $44 billion deal to acquire the company.The monthslong battle over Elon Musk's bid to buy Twitter has been massive in scale and drama. One of the tech industry's biggest deals in recent years, it has captured the public's imagination, with cinematic twists that have been closely followed even by people who have never written a tweet.Now Mr. Musk, in a surprise move, has added another plot turn. After months of trying to get out of a deal that he struck in April, the billionaire made a proposal on Monday night that could bring the acrimonious legal fight to an end.Mr. Musk said he would do exactly what he said he would do in April: Acquire Twitter at $54.20 per share, according to regulatory filings made public on Tuesday.Twitter, which sued Mr. Musk in July to force him to go through with the $44 billion deal, has yet to accept his new proposal and plans to add conditions to try to ensure that he doesn't change his mind again.In a short statement, Twitter said it had received Mr. Musk's letter and reiterated the company's intention to close the deal. Twitter may ask a court in Delaware, where it filed its suit, for protections that would force Mr. Musk to follow through with his new proposal, said three people familiar with the company's plans, who were not authorized to speak publicly about them. The company could also demand that Mr. Musk pay interest on the deal price for the delays in completing the acquisition, one of those people added.A deal would allow both sides to avoid a messy trial that was expected to start in two weeks in Delaware Chancery Court. The trial most likely would have featured testimony from Mr. Musk, who runs the electric automaker Tesla, and senior Twitter executives. Mr. Musk is scheduled to be deposed on Thursday and Friday in Austin, Texas, according to a legal filing.Twitter has barely been profitable for most of its history and is dwarfed in size by other social media platforms like Facebook and the much younger TikTok. But the fight with Mr. Musk has preoccupied Silicon Valley, Wall Street and Washington because Twitter has for years been an online bullhorn for opinionated tech industry billionaires like Mr. Musk and politicians like former President Donald J. Trump, whom the company barred from its platform last year after the Jan. 6 riot on Capitol Hill.If Mr. Musk does take over Twitter, one of his first big moves could be allowing Mr. Trump to return. Mr. Musk has said it was a \\\"mistake\\\" for Twitter to bar Mr. Trump.The potential agreement follows months of disputes that have created existential challenges for Twitter, cratering its share price, demoralizing its employees and spooking the advertisers it relies on for revenue.Mr. Musk, with his repeated, scathing criticism of Twitter and its management, has often seemed more interested in taking a wrecking ball to the company than becoming its new owner. His critics have argued that he has simply been looking for anything to justify backing out of a rash decision that he quickly came to regret.\\\"I think he recognized that litigation is not going well on his part,\\\" said Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at Tulane Law School.A deal at the original price would be a victory for Twitter. Mr. Musk declared in July that he no longer intended to continue with the acquisition because he believed Twitter's service was overrun by spam. Twitter sued him soon after.Mr. Musk submitted his latest proposal to Twitter on Monday evening, informing the company that he intended to proceed with his original offer. \\\"We write to notify you that the Musk parties intend to proceed to closing of the transaction,\\\" a lawyer for Mr. Musk wrote in the letter, according to a regulatory filing. The letter asked that the court battle be paused, pending the closing of the deal.The two sides met in court in an emergency virtual hearing on Tuesday to discuss the proposal before Kathaleen McCormick, the judge overseeing the trial. The proposal was reported earlier by Bloomberg.Lawyers for Mr. Musk and Twitter were expected to meet again in court later on Tuesday to discuss next steps, the person said. If they opt to proceed with the sale of Twitter, a deal could possibly close within weeks, or as soon as Mr. Musk hands over the $44 billion.Twitter may request that Mr. Musk agree to have the court supervise the deal's closing, three people familiar with the matter said. The company may also ask Mr. Musk to pay a daily interest fee for every day that has passed since shareholders approved the deal on Sept. 13, one of those people said.\\\"Procedurally, Twitter has done everything they need to do to close this deal,\\\" said Brian J.M. Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School. If the company accepts Mr. Musk's proposal, it could request that the trial be postponed until the deal is completed, Mr. Quinn said. Once the acquisition is completed, Twitter will most likely dismiss its lawsuit against Mr. Musk.On Tuesday evening, Mr. Musk tweeted that \\\"buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.\\\" X is the name of holding company that Mr. Musk formed to buy Twitter.Shares in the social media company spiked more than 12 percent on the news of Mr. Musk's latest offer, before a halt in trading. Trading resumed in the afternoon, and Twitter's share price closed at $52, a 22 percent increase.The economic backdrop has changed significantly since Mr. Musk announced his intent to buy Twitter last spring. Amid inflation and geopolitical uncertainty, investors are facing the kinds of losses they haven't seen since 2009. That has also made it more difficult to finance deals.Investment banks, led by Morgan Stanley, have already agreed to help finance the deal with about $13 billion in debt. The banks remain on the hook until April, according to the terms of their contract.Mr. Musk has said he would finance the rest of the deal in cash. In April, he sold about $8.5 billion shares in Tesla to help fund the deal; in May, he said he had lined up about $7 billion in cash from an array of investors including the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and the tech mogul Larry Ellison. It was not immediately clear what commitments those investors had to Mr. Musk.In August, Mr. Musk sold an additional $7 billion worth of Tesla's stock in \\\"the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close and some equity partners don't come through,\\\" he wrote at the time.Twitter employees learned of Mr. Musk's proposal from media reports while participating in a companywide meeting about corporate plans for 2023 on Tuesday, reigniting confusion and speculation that have roiled Twitter's work force over the past six months, four employees said.Parag Agrawal, Twitter's chief executive, did not immediately address Mr. Musk's offer with employees, those people added. Sean Edgett, Twitter's general counsel, said in an email to employees on Tuesday afternoon, \\\"I will continue to keep you posted on significant updates, but in the meantime, thank you for your patience as we work through this on the legal side.\\\"On the internal Slack messaging system on Tuesday, employees discussed the implications for the company, their jobs and their stock compensation. In a channel with nearly 2,000 members that is used to joke about company news, some wondered what would happen if Twitter's board did not accept Mr. Musk's renewed offer. Some speculated that Twitter's stock would plummet, while another, referring to Mr. Musk, said the company would not have to be owned by \\\"a moron.\\\"While an agreement would signify an end to the uncertainty clouding Twitter's immediate future, Mr. Musk's plans for the company are not clear. He told investors before trying to back out of the deal that by 2025, he could get the company to 500 million daily users and revenue of $13.2 billion.Twitter and Mr. Musk were set for a showdown this month in a Delaware courtroom. The company argued in legal filings that Mr. Musk's reasons for abandoning the deal were smoke screens, and suggested that he had simply hoped for a lower price after stock market declines decreased his wealth.Mr. Musk said Twitter had most likely undercounted the amount of spam on its platform, making the company less valuable than he initially believed. He also cited whistle-blower claims from a former Twitter executive, who said the company had misled regulators about its security practices, as a reason to exit the deal.Ryan Mac contributed reporting.Ryan Mac contributed reporting.PhotographElon Musk, center, has agreed to acquire Twitter at $54.20 per share, the same price he agreed to in April before getting cold feet.

He referred to a disclosure earlier this month that fewer than 5% of monetizable daily active users were fake or spam accounts. Musk followed up the post with a clarification: \\\"Still committed to acquisition.\\\"\\nTwitter declined to comment on Musk's posts. Tesla didn't return a request to make Musk available for comment.\\nBrian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School, told Barron's that for Musk to successfully walk away from the deal, he would need to prove revelations about bots and how Twitter disclosed their presence among its user counts had a \\\"material adverse effect\\\" on the firm.\\n\\\"These kinds of claims tend not to be strong,\\\" Quinn says. \\\"So there's a lot of bravado, a lot of back and forth, but they tend not to be strong. You do find people renegotiating prices downward, but not by a whole lot.\\\"\\nMusk's comments follow a broader slide for technology stocks, which likely would have included Twitter had there not been a deal at $54.20 in place. Quinn says that though potential acquirers often have buyer's remorse after signing a deal shortly before a market slide, the way the merger agreement is structured, that doesn't count for anything. He says if Musk tries to walk away, Twitter has the option to take Musk to court instead of accepting a $1 billion breakup fee.\\nIf Twitter can prove to a Delaware court that Musk's financing is still in place, the court could issue an order for specific performance that would compel Musk to close the merger, Quinn says.\\n\\\"A Delaware court that looks at this merger agreement will give an order for specific performance if this deal is capable of being closed,\\\" Quinn says. \\\"And if Musk just says 'I'm not going to do it,' they will get the order and they'll force him to close.\\\"\\nMerger arbitrage traders are still skeptical. Twitter stock fell 9.5% in Friday trading. At $40.80, shares are off 25% from the deal price Musk agreed to, implying traders don't believe a deal is a sure thing, at least at $54.20.\\nWrite to Connor Smith at [email\\u00c2\\u00a0protected] \\n Corporate Law Expert Says Musk Can't Just Walk Away From Twitter Deal \\nCredit: By Connor Smith \",\n          \"12-Apr-22 - Elon Musk's Twitter Stake Is Forcing Tesla Investors to Consider the Key-Man Risk - Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO and Twitter's largest shareholder.

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are off about 3% and 6%, respectively.\\nStill, Tesla investors might wonder if Musk's involvement could affect his ability to do his day job running the most valuable car company on the planet.\\nThat possibility, known as the key-man risk, has always existed with Tesla, but Wall Street experts like Gerber Kawasaki CEO Ross Gerber and Roth analyst Craig Irwin don't see all that much reason for additional concern.\\nGerber, a bullish Tesla investor, told Barron's that he would like to see Tesla develop a \\\"deeper bench\\\" of management talent, but doesn't believe Musk is focused on that right now. Tesla is the largest holding in Gerber's ETF, Gerber Kawasaki AdvisorShares (GK), at more than 11% of the portfolio.\\nMusk has his plate full, ramping up two new plants\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094one in Berlin and one in Austin, Texas\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094and working on Tesla's self-driving software. He is even developing a robot to do the mundane manufacturing tasks that humans now handle.\\n Irwin looks at the question of the key-man risk another way. Of course, there are catastrophic outcomes that no one can rule out completely, but \\\"Tesla is Elon Musk,\\\" said Irwin, likening his impact to that of Steve Jobs at Apple (AAPL) decades ago. \\\"He will be the most important person at Tesla for the next 20 years,\\\" he added.\\nMusk is 50, turning 51 in June. Irwin doesn't see Musk leaving for Twitter or being overly distracted by his investment.\\nNonetheless, the analyst is cautious in his assessment of Tesla. He rates shares Hold, but has a low $250 price target. Tesla closed at $975.73 on Monday. Irwin believes Tesla should be one of the most valuable auto makers around, just not one of the most valuable companies in the market.\\nTesla is the fifth most valuable company in the S&P 500 and worth roughly 3.5 times more than Toyota Motor (TM), the second most valuable car maker in the world.\\nThe Musk-Twitter impact on Tesla stock looks likely to fade. Tesla investors, after all, are used to Musk's tweets and Musk doing other things\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094such as running his spacecraft company, SpaceX, with President Gwynne Shotwell.\\nShotwell is a well-respected executive in the aerospace industry. Investors may want to see the emergence of her counterpart at Tesla in coming years.\\nWrite to Al Root at [email\\u00c2\\u00a0protected] \\n Elon Musk's Twitter Stake Is Forcing Tesla Investors to Consider the Key-Man Risk \\nCredit: Al Root \",\n          \"1-Dec-22 - Tesla Set to Deliver Semi Truck to PepsiCo, Expanding Beyond Passenger Vehicles; Car company is slated to host event Thursday to mark the occasion - Tesla Inc. is poised to deliver its first all-electric semitrailer truck Thursday, marking the company's long-delayed expansion beyond the passenger vehicle market.\\nFood and beverage maker PepsiCo Inc. is expected to take delivery of the Semi, five years after Elon Musk revealed the model.\\nThe Semi, originally due out in 2019, would be the first new model Tesla is putting in customer hands since early 2020, when the company began delivering its Model Y crossover.\\nTesla is slated to host an event to mark the occasion in the Reno, Nev., area, where it has been producing the Semi and jointly operates a battery factory. A live-stream is expected to begin around 5 p.m. local time, according to PepsiCo. Mr. Musk has said he plans to attend.\\nThe Tesla chief executive introduced the concept in 2017 as Tesla was struggling to mass-produce its Model 3 sedan, promising a truck that would travel 500 miles on a single charge and be cheaper to operate than a diesel competitor.\\nThis year, Tesla's stock is down around 45% through Thursday as the company grapples with greater competition, regulatory scrutiny and investor unease over Mr. Musk's acquisition of Twitter Inc. Tesla's stock-price decline has eclipsed that of other major auto makers, as well as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index.\\nTesla didn't respond to a request for comment on issues including the number of trucks it plans to deliver to PepsiCo and their price tag.\\nPepsiCo declined to comment on those topics. The company has said the trucks would support plants in Sacramento and Modesto, Calif. A typical diesel-powered semitrailer truck costs around $120,000 in the U.S., according to consulting firm Roland Berger.\\nPepsiCo's Frito-Lay unit has teamed up with a local public health agency to replace its diesel-powered freight equipment in Modesto with 15 Tesla semitrailer trucks, among other vehicles and equipment. The California Air Resources Board has committed to funding half of that $30.8 million overhaul.\\nTesla's planned delivery of its Semi comes after President Biden in August signed into law legislation creating a new tax credit of up to $40,000 for commercial electric vehicles beginning in 2023, among other incentives.\\n EV Rivals Aiming for Tesla's Crown in China \\nSeveral other companies, including Daimler Truck Holding AG and Volvo AB, have been developing electric semitrailer trucks, though the market remains nascent. The scarcity of charging infrastructure capable of powering up heavy trucks means they are better suited for shorter trips close to a central hub than they are for long-haul routes, said Wilfried Aulbur, who runs Roland Berger's commercial-vehicle-consulting practice.\\nTesla's Semi is unusual in that it was designed from the ground-up to be electric, rather than being a modified version of a diesel truck, Dr. Aulbur said.\\nThe Semi will be capable of accelerating from zero to 60 miles an hour in 20 seconds and recharging up to 70% of its range in half an hour, Tesla says on its website. In keeping with Tesla's propensity for unusual design elements, the Semi's cab features a single, centrally located seat. The steering wheel is flanked by two display screens.\\n\\\"By removing the motor and the transmission in front of the vehicle, we could put the driver in the middle for the best command view,\\\" Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla's chief designer, recently told CNBC .\\nTesla is aiming to produce 50,000 Semi trucks in 2024 in North America, Mr. Musk said in October. He previously said battery-cell supply constraints made scaling truck production difficult. For now, output remains limited. Tesla might produce 100 semitrailer trucks this year, Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm said during a recent trial over Mr. Musk's compensation package at Tesla. Internal projections from early 2018 contemplated producing thousands of the trucks, she said.\\nThursday's event comes as Tesla pushes to deliver as many vehicles as possible in the final weeks of the year. The company cut its annual growth expectations this fall, saying it expects to finish the year just shy of its 2022 target of boosting vehicle deliveries by 50%.\\nTesla is offering a $3,750 credit to U.S. customers who buy certain Model 3s or Model Ys for delivery this month, according to the company's website.\\nMr. Musk, who runs Twitter and rocket company SpaceX in addition to Tesla, has said he has been spending much of his time recently running the social-media company. At Twitter, Mr. Musk has encountered some challenges engaging with consumer brands. Many have paused advertising on the platform , citing concern over how it would evolve under Mr. Musk. Tesla's brand image, meanwhile, has fallen in long-running surveys.\\nThe serial entrepreneur spoke Wednesday at an event for Neuralink Corp. , a neuroscience startup working on brain-implant technologies that he co-founded.\\nWrite to Rebecca Elliott at [email\\u00c2\\u00a0protected] \\n Tesla Set to Deliver Semi Truck to PepsiCo, Expanding Beyond Passenger Vehicles \\nCredit: By Rebecca Elliott \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It also slightly reduces the amount of cash Musk needs to put up personally.\\nCNBC reported that Musk is expected to serve as temporary chief executive of Twitter for a \\\"few months,\\\" after he completes the deal.\\nSaudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman of the board at Kingdom Holding Co., made the biggest contribution, agreeing to commit almost 35 million shares in Twitter -- worth $1.9 billion -- to retain a stake in the company after Musk's takeover, according to an amended securities filing Thursday morning.\\nEllison, the co-founder of Oracle Corp. who has a big stake in Tesla and a seat on its board, committed $1 billion through his trust.\\nOther investors named in the filing Thursday include the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance Holdings Ltd., Brookfield Asset Management, Fidelity Management & Research and Qatar Holding.\\nChangpeng Zhao, chief executive of Binance, which promised $500 million, tweeted that it was \\\"a small contribution to the cause.\\\"\\nWith the financing picture becoming clearer, the market seems to be coming around to the idea that the deal will close.\\nThe gap between Twitter's stock price and the $54.20 per share that Musk offered to pay for the company is at its narrowest point since April 26. Twitter shares rose 2.7% to $50.36 on Thursday.\\nThe deal is set to close later this year, and the two sides have each agreed to pay a $1-billion breakup fee if it falls apart.\\nThe world's wealthiest person reached an agreement April 25 to acquire Twitter using a financing plan that has alarmed some Tesla investors.\\nIn addition to pledging tens of billions of dollars' worth of his Tesla shares to support margin loans, Musk vowed to line up some $21 billion of equity.\\nThat number has risen to $27.25 billion, according to Thursday's filing. Musk has sold more than $8.5 billion of Tesla stock to finance the deal.\\n\\\"In this game of high stakes poker, Ellison and the impressive list of backers will remove more of an overhang from Tesla shares as the Musk leverage of shares now becomes less onerous,\\\" said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush. \\\"This was a smart financial and strategic move by Musk that will be well received across the board.\\\"\\nMusk's latest backers include a bevy of traditional asset managers, venture capital firms, boutique hedge funds and one of the world's largest pools of capital.\\nQatar Holding, a unit of the nation's wealth fund, has agreed to commit $375 million.\\nAlwaleed previously rejected Musk's bid, stating that it failed to come \\\"close to the intrinsic value of Twitter.\\\"\\nMusk is also in discussions with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey on contributing some of his shares toward the acquisition.\\nEllison, 77, is the richest person in the group besides Musk. The corporate software titan has a net worth of $95.6 billion, placing him 11th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\\nHe's not an active Twitter user -- his only tweet was a decade ago -- but he does share some of Musk's political views. Ellison is a major Republican donor and hosted a fundraiser for former President Trump in 2020.\\nSilicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who has publicly feuded with Dorsey on Twitter, has agreed to commit $400 million via his fund Andreessen Horowitz, known as a16z. Fellow venture firm Sequoia Capital is putting up $800 million.\\nBen Horowitz, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, cited the work of Twitter founders Evan Williams and Dorsey as a reason the firm invested.\\n\\\"We believe in EV and Jack's vision to connect the world and we believe in Elon's brilliance to finally make it what it was meant to be,\\\" Horowitz said.\\nSeveral Tesla investors are among those committing support for Musk's Twitter bid, including Ellison, who owns 1.45% of the carmaker's outstanding shares, and Fidelity Management & Research Co., which owns about 1%. Both are among Tesla's biggest investors.\\nSmaller investors include Witkoff Capital, real estate tycoon Steven Witkoff's firm, and Cartenna Capital, a hedge fund set up by Peter Avellone, a former Millennium Management portfolio manager.\\nMusk had been building up a stake in Twitter since early this year, eventually amassing more than 9% of the company and becoming its largest individual shareholder.\\nHe was offered a seat on the board, which he turned down because of the restrictions it would have placed on him for buying more shares. Instead, he made a formal offer for Twitter on April 14, subject to financing that wasn't immediately spelled out.\\nWith more than 90 million followers on Twitter, Musk is one of the platform's most prominent and outspoken users.\\nHe is known for sometimes cryptic or mysterious tweets, lobbed at all hours of the day, on topics as diverse as cryptocurrencies, space travel and whether Twitter should have an edit button.\\nSome of the ideas he has thrown out for Twitter include that it limit advertising, open-source its algorithm and do more to emphasize free-speech principles.\\nCaption: PHOTO: ORACLE CO-FOUNDER Larry Ellison, above in 2019, is among investors who agreed to bankroll the Twitter deal. He committed $1 billion through his trust.\\nPHOTOGRAPHER:Justin Sullivan Getty Images\\nCredit: Turner and Chan write for Bloomberg.\",\n          \"Elon Musk will no longer join the board of Twitter, just days after the company announced his appointment.\\nThe rapid U-turn was quickly reflected in the share price movement as the social-media company's stock fell more than 4% in premarket trading Monday.\\nInvestors hoping that Musk's influence at a board level would bring about change were clearly disappointed. But it's far from the end of the story. Musk remains Twitter's largest shareholder after taking a 9.2% stake, and he hasn't been shy when it comes to raising potential changes to the platform, even if some have been on the jokey side.\\nBut his sudden decision, announced by Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and, oddly, not by the man himself, does cast doubt on where the billionaire's journey with the social-media giant will end up. Agrawal stated the board appointment was contingent on a background check and \\\"formal acceptance,\\\" adding that Musk informed the company on Saturday he would no longer be joining the board.\\nAs for Musk, his intentions have never been that clear, although a poll on removing the edit button and posts about free speech have offered clues.\\nBut the stock, which surged 27% on its best ever day last week , is still around 13% higher than it was before Musk disclosed his stake, even factoring in Monday's early fall.\\nRegardless of his next move, or the level of influence he might have, the Tesla CEO's very presence as Twitter's largest shareholder will keep management on its toes. Investors want the company's financial results to be in line with the chirpiness of its leading shareholder.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Callum Keown\\n*** Join Barron's senior managing editor Lauren R.

And his more than 81 million followers are listening.\\n* Some of his cheekier ideas are showing up on Musk's own Twitter account. He's taking a poll asking whether to delete the \\\"w\\\" in the word Twitter, and as of 11:45 p.m. Sunday, 51% have voted yes, while 49% have voted \\\"of course.\\\" Those were the only options.\\n* He also put out a poll asking whether to convert Twitter's San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter \\\"since no one shows up anyway.\\\" So far, the yes vote has 91.3%, and the no vote has 8.7%.\\n* Musk proposed giving authentication check marks to everyone who signs up for Twitter Blue, a monthly subscription that offers premium features and the ability to customize an individual's experience. They would be different from the check marks for verified accounts or public figures.\\n* Musk also agreed with a user who suggested subscriptions should be cheaper in less affluent countries, saying the cost \\\"should be proportionate to affordability,\\\" Axios reported. \\\"Maybe even an option to pay in Doge?\\\" he mused, referring to the Dogecoin cryptocurrency.\\nWhat's Next: Late Sunday, Agrawal tweeted that Musk told the company on Saturday he wouldn't be joining the board. \\\"I believe this is for the best,\\\" Agrawal said, adding the company remains open to Musk's input as its biggest shareholder.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Janet H.

Aleksandr Dvornikov was named to run operations in Ukraine, but that won't erase Russia's record there, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN Sunday. \\\"This general will just be another author of crimes and brutality against Ukrainian civilians.\\\"\\n* Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba told NBC that the U.S. has provided heavy air-defense systems and is helping Ukraine get additional weapons from other countries. \\\"You provide us with everything that we need, and we fight so that you don't have to.\\\"\\n* Sullivan said he and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley spent two hours on the phone with the Ukrainian Armed Forces chief making plans to deliver all the weapons Ukraine wants to strengthen Ukraine's position on the battlefield and at the bargaining table.\\n* U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Kyiv over the weekend and talked to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Sullivan told NBC that Biden isn't currently planning a trip there.\\nWhat's Next: Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said that Finland's Parliament will discuss possible NATO membership \\\"within the coming weeks\\\" with talks that could wrap up \\\"before midsummer.\\\" Finland shares an 800-mile border with Russia.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Janet H.

To prepare for the travel surge, carriers hired more pilots, flight attendants, gate agents, ramp workers, and customer-service representatives, The Wall Street Journal reported.\\n* JetBlue, which grappled with another weekend of flight delays and cancellations, told workers it will cut capacity 8% to 10% in May and by similar levels through the summer even as it braces for a wave of travel demand.\\n* While JetBlue has hired 3,000 more workers, it is still short-staffed. It is competing with Frontier to buy Spirit Airlines. \\\"Based on your feedback that the schedule is wound too tight, we know the best plan is to reduce capacity now,\\\" JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty told staff.\\n* American Airlines hired more than 600 pilots and is focused on supply-chain issues such as catering. Alaska Air Group, Delta Air Lines, and American pilots have picketed in recent weeks, complaining about flight schedules leaving pilots overworked and fatigued, the Journal reported.\\n* Storms in Florida earlier in April forced flight attendants to wait hours for transportation and hotels, and some slept in airports, unions that represent American and Southwest Airlines flight attendants said. Southwest said it is working to improve its contingency planning.\\nWhat's Next: JetBlue is offering $1,000 bonuses to flight attendants who don't call out of work through May 31 and an extra $100 a trip for working on their days off. Southwest raised starting pay to $17 an hour and waived requirements that workers have high school diplomas.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Janet H. Cho\\n***\\nBank Earnings Expected to Reveal Effects of Market Volatility\\nBank earnings are due for the volatile first quarter, when Russia's war on Ukraine began and threw markets and the financial businesses associated with them into disarray. Some banks have already detailed exposure to Russian assets held, but the fallout will likely extend to revenue from deal making and trading.\\n* Big banks are leaving Russia and face losses. Goldman Sachs' credit exposure there was $650 million at the end of 2021, and JPMorgan has said exiting Russia could cost it $1 billion. Citigroup could lose $4 billion.\\n* Equity capital markets, a business that includes initial public offerings, is expected to be weak. Dealogic says revenue is down 75% from the same period last year and 61% from the quarter ending in December. Merger volumes have fallen by one-third the robust level of last year.\\n* Stock trading results could also be blunted, but commodities and currency trading may help offset that. The price of U.S. benchmark crude oil is up 30% so far this year.\\n* JPMorgan kicks off the week on Wednesday, with expected earnings per share of $2.72, while Goldman and Wells Fargo among others come Thursday, with EPS expected to be $8.95 and 82 cents, respectively.\\nWhat's Next: Banks benefit when interest rates rise because they can charge more interest on loans without immediately raising the rates they pay on deposits. The Federal Reserve's meeting in May, when many expect it to bump up rates a half-point, could be a catalyst for bank stocks.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Liz Moyer\\n***\\nMarketWatch Wants to Hear From You\\nWhen does a solo 401(k) make sense for self-employed people, and what are the contribution limits?\\nA MarketWatch correspondent will answer this question soon.

One of the tech industry's biggest deals in recent years, it has captured the public's imagination, with cinematic twists that have been closely followed even by people who have never written a tweet.Now Mr. Musk, in a surprise move, has added another plot turn. After months of trying to get out of a deal that he struck in April, the billionaire made a proposal on Monday night that could bring the acrimonious legal fight to an end.Mr. Musk said he would do exactly what he said he would do in April: Acquire Twitter at $54.20 per share, according to regulatory filings made public on Tuesday.Twitter, which sued Mr. Musk in July to force him to go through with the $44 billion deal, has yet to accept his new proposal and plans to add conditions to try to ensure that he doesn't change his mind again.In a short statement, Twitter said it had received Mr. Musk's letter and reiterated the company's intention to close the deal. Twitter may ask a court in Delaware, where it filed its suit, for protections that would force Mr. Musk to follow through with his new proposal, said three people familiar with the company's plans, who were not authorized to speak publicly about them. The company could also demand that Mr. Musk pay interest on the deal price for the delays in completing the acquisition, one of those people added.A deal would allow both sides to avoid a messy trial that was expected to start in two weeks in Delaware Chancery Court. The trial most likely would have featured testimony from Mr. Musk, who runs the electric automaker Tesla, and senior Twitter executives. Mr. Musk is scheduled to be deposed on Thursday and Friday in Austin, Texas, according to a legal filing.Twitter has barely been profitable for most of its history and is dwarfed in size by other social media platforms like Facebook and the much younger TikTok. But the fight with Mr. Musk has preoccupied Silicon Valley, Wall Street and Washington because Twitter has for years been an online bullhorn for opinionated tech industry billionaires like Mr. Musk and politicians like former President Donald J. Trump, whom the company barred from its platform last year after the Jan. 6 riot on Capitol Hill.If Mr. Musk does take over Twitter, one of his first big moves could be allowing Mr. Trump to return. Mr. Musk has said it was a \\\"mistake\\\" for Twitter to bar Mr. Trump.The potential agreement follows months of disputes that have created existential challenges for Twitter, cratering its share price, demoralizing its employees and spooking the advertisers it relies on for revenue.Mr. Musk, with his repeated, scathing criticism of Twitter and its management, has often seemed more interested in taking a wrecking ball to the company than becoming its new owner. His critics have argued that he has simply been looking for anything to justify backing out of a rash decision that he quickly came to regret.\\\"I think he recognized that litigation is not going well on his part,\\\" said Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at Tulane Law School.A deal at the original price would be a victory for Twitter. Mr. Musk declared in July that he no longer intended to continue with the acquisition because he believed Twitter's service was overrun by spam. Twitter sued him soon after.Mr. Musk submitted his latest proposal to Twitter on Monday evening, informing the company that he intended to proceed with his original offer. \\\"We write to notify you that the Musk parties intend to proceed to closing of the transaction,\\\" a lawyer for Mr. Musk wrote in the letter, according to a regulatory filing. The letter asked that the court battle be paused, pending the closing of the deal.The two sides met in court in an emergency virtual hearing on Tuesday to discuss the proposal before Kathaleen McCormick, the judge overseeing the trial. The proposal was reported earlier by Bloomberg.Lawyers for Mr. Musk and Twitter were expected to meet again in court later on Tuesday to discuss next steps, the person said. If they opt to proceed with the sale of Twitter, a deal could possibly close within weeks, or as soon as Mr. Musk hands over the $44 billion.Twitter may request that Mr. Musk agree to have the court supervise the deal's closing, three people familiar with the matter said. The company may also ask Mr. Musk to pay a daily interest fee for every day that has passed since shareholders approved the deal on Sept. 13, one of those people said.\\\"Procedurally, Twitter has done everything they need to do to close this deal,\\\" said Brian J.M. Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School. If the company accepts Mr. Musk's proposal, it could request that the trial be postponed until the deal is completed, Mr. Quinn said. Once the acquisition is completed, Twitter will most likely dismiss its lawsuit against Mr. Musk.On Tuesday evening, Mr. Musk tweeted that \\\"buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.\\\" X is the name of holding company that Mr. Musk formed to buy Twitter.Shares in the social media company spiked more than 12 percent on the news of Mr. Musk's latest offer, before a halt in trading. Trading resumed in the afternoon, and Twitter's share price closed at $52, a 22 percent increase.The economic backdrop has changed significantly since Mr. Musk announced his intent to buy Twitter last spring. Amid inflation and geopolitical uncertainty, investors are facing the kinds of losses they haven't seen since 2009. That has also made it more difficult to finance deals.Investment banks, led by Morgan Stanley, have already agreed to help finance the deal with about $13 billion in debt. The banks remain on the hook until April, according to the terms of their contract.Mr. Musk has said he would finance the rest of the deal in cash. In April, he sold about $8.5 billion shares in Tesla to help fund the deal; in May, he said he had lined up about $7 billion in cash from an array of investors including the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and the tech mogul Larry Ellison. It was not immediately clear what commitments those investors had to Mr. Musk.In August, Mr. Musk sold an additional $7 billion worth of Tesla's stock in \\\"the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close and some equity partners don't come through,\\\" he wrote at the time.Twitter employees learned of Mr. Musk's proposal from media reports while participating in a companywide meeting about corporate plans for 2023 on Tuesday, reigniting confusion and speculation that have roiled Twitter's work force over the past six months, four employees said.Parag Agrawal, Twitter's chief executive, did not immediately address Mr. Musk's offer with employees, those people added. Sean Edgett, Twitter's general counsel, said in an email to employees on Tuesday afternoon, \\\"I will continue to keep you posted on significant updates, but in the meantime, thank you for your patience as we work through this on the legal side.\\\"On the internal Slack messaging system on Tuesday, employees discussed the implications for the company, their jobs and their stock compensation. In a channel with nearly 2,000 members that is used to joke about company news, some wondered what would happen if Twitter's board did not accept Mr. Musk's renewed offer. Some speculated that Twitter's stock would plummet, while another, referring to Mr. Musk, said the company would not have to be owned by \\\"a moron.\\\"While an agreement would signify an end to the uncertainty clouding Twitter's immediate future, Mr. Musk's plans for the company are not clear. He told investors before trying to back out of the deal that by 2025, he could get the company to 500 million daily users and revenue of $13.2 billion.Twitter and Mr. Musk were set for a showdown this month in a Delaware courtroom. The company argued in legal filings that Mr. Musk's reasons for abandoning the deal were smoke screens, and suggested that he had simply hoped for a lower price after stock market declines decreased his wealth.Mr. Musk said Twitter had most likely undercounted the amount of spam on its platform, making the company less valuable than he initially believed. He also cited whistle-blower claims from a former Twitter executive, who said the company had misled regulators about its security practices, as a reason to exit the deal.Ryan Mac contributed reporting.Ryan Mac contributed reporting.PhotographElon Musk, center, has agreed to acquire Twitter at $54.20 per share, the same price he agreed to in April before getting cold feet.

He referred to a disclosure earlier this month that fewer than 5% of monetizable daily active users were fake or spam accounts.

You do find people renegotiating prices downward, but not by a whole lot.\\\"\\nMusk's comments follow a broader slide for technology stocks, which likely would have included Twitter had there not been a deal at $54.20 in place. Quinn says that though potential acquirers often have buyer's remorse after signing a deal shortly before a market slide, the way the merger agreement is structured, that doesn't count for anything. He says if Musk tries to walk away, Twitter has the option to take Musk to court instead of accepting a $1 billion breakup fee.\\nIf Twitter can prove to a Delaware court that Musk's financing is still in place, the court could issue an order for specific performance that would compel Musk to close the merger, Quinn says.\\n\\\"A Delaware court that looks at this merger agreement will give an order for specific performance if this deal is capable of being closed,\\\" Quinn says. \\\"And if Musk just says 'I'm not going to do it,' they will get the order and they'll force him to close.\\\"\\nMerger arbitrage traders are still skeptical. Twitter stock fell 9.5% in Friday trading.

It also slightly reduces the amount of cash Musk needs to put up personally.\\nCNBC reported that Musk is expected to serve as temporary chief executive of Twitter for a \\\"few months,\\\" after he completes the deal.\\nSaudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman of the board at Kingdom Holding Co., made the biggest contribution, agreeing to commit almost 35 million shares in Twitter -- worth $1.9 billion -- to retain a stake in the company after Musk's takeover, according to an amended securities filing Thursday morning.\\nEllison, the co-founder of Oracle Corp. who has a big stake in Tesla and a seat on its board, committed $1 billion through his trust.\\nOther investors named in the filing Thursday include the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance Holdings Ltd., Brookfield Asset Management, Fidelity Management & Research and Qatar Holding.\\nChangpeng Zhao, chief executive of Binance, which promised $500 million, tweeted that it was \\\"a small contribution to the cause.\\\"\\nWith the financing picture becoming clearer, the market seems to be coming around to the idea that the deal will close.\\nThe gap between Twitter's stock price and the $54.20 per share that Musk offered to pay for the company is at its narrowest point since April 26. Twitter shares rose 2.7% to $50.36 on Thursday.\\nThe deal is set to close later this year, and the two sides have each agreed to pay a $1-billion breakup fee if it falls apart.\\nThe world's wealthiest person reached an agreement April 25 to acquire Twitter using a financing plan that has alarmed some Tesla investors.\\nIn addition to pledging tens of billions of dollars' worth of his Tesla shares to support margin loans, Musk vowed to line up some $21 billion of equity.\\nThat number has risen to $27.25 billion, according to Thursday's filing. Musk has sold more than $8.5 billion of Tesla stock to finance the deal.\\n\\\"In this game of high stakes poker, Ellison and the impressive list of backers will remove more of an overhang from Tesla shares as the Musk leverage of shares now becomes less onerous,\\\" said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush. \\\"This was a smart financial and strategic move by Musk that will be well received across the board.\\\"\\nMusk's latest backers include a bevy of traditional asset managers, venture capital firms, boutique hedge funds and one of the world's largest pools of capital.\\nQatar Holding, a unit of the nation's wealth fund, has agreed to commit $375 million.\\nAlwaleed previously rejected Musk's bid, stating that it failed to come \\\"close to the intrinsic value of Twitter.\\\"\\nMusk is also in discussions with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey on contributing some of his shares toward the acquisition.\\nEllison, 77, is the richest person in the group besides Musk. The corporate software titan has a net worth of $95.6 billion, placing him 11th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\\nHe's not an active Twitter user -- his only tweet was a decade ago -- but he does share some of Musk's political views. Ellison is a major Republican donor and hosted a fundraiser for former President Trump in 2020.\\nSilicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who has publicly feuded with Dorsey on Twitter, has agreed to commit $400 million via his fund Andreessen Horowitz, known as a16z. Fellow venture firm Sequoia Capital is putting up $800 million.\\nBen Horowitz, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, cited the work of Twitter founders Evan Williams and Dorsey as a reason the firm invested.\\n\\\"We believe in EV and Jack's vision to connect the world and we believe in Elon's brilliance to finally make it what it was meant to be,\\\" Horowitz said.\\nSeveral Tesla investors are among those committing support for Musk's Twitter bid, including Ellison, who owns 1.45% of the carmaker's outstanding shares, and Fidelity Management & Research Co., which owns about 1%. Both are among Tesla's biggest investors.\\nSmaller investors include Witkoff Capital, real estate tycoon Steven Witkoff's firm, and Cartenna Capital, a hedge fund set up by Peter Avellone, a former Millennium Management portfolio manager.\\nMusk had been building up a stake in Twitter since early this year, eventually amassing more than 9% of the company and becoming its largest individual shareholder.\\nHe was offered a seat on the board, which he turned down because of the restrictions it would have placed on him for buying more shares. Instead, he made a formal offer for Twitter on April 14, subject to financing that wasn't immediately spelled out.\\nWith more than 90 million followers on Twitter, Musk is one of the platform's most prominent and outspoken users.\\nHe is known for sometimes cryptic or mysterious tweets, lobbed at all hours of the day, on topics as diverse as cryptocurrencies, space travel and whether Twitter should have an edit button.\\nSome of the ideas he has thrown out for Twitter include that it limit advertising, open-source its algorithm and do more to emphasize free-speech principles.\\nCaption: PHOTO: ORACLE CO-FOUNDER Larry Ellison, above in 2019, is among investors who agreed to bankroll the Twitter deal.

But it's far from the end of the story. Musk remains Twitter's largest shareholder after taking a 9.2% stake, and he hasn't been shy when it comes to raising potential changes to the platform, even if some have been on the jokey side.\\nBut his sudden decision, announced by Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and, oddly, not by the man himself, does cast doubt on where the billionaire's journey with the social-media giant will end up. Agrawal stated the board appointment was contingent on a background check and \\\"formal acceptance,\\\" adding that Musk informed the company on Saturday he would no longer be joining the board.\\nAs for Musk, his intentions have never been that clear, although a poll on removing the edit button and posts about free speech have offered clues.\\nBut the stock, which surged 27% on its best ever day last week , is still around 13% higher than it was before Musk disclosed his stake, even factoring in Monday's early fall.\\nRegardless of his next move, or the level of influence he might have, the Tesla CEO's very presence as Twitter's largest shareholder will keep management on its toes. Investors want the company's financial results to be in line with the chirpiness of its leading shareholder.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Callum Keown\\n*** Join Barron's senior managing editor Lauren R.

And his more than 81 million followers are listening.\\n* Some of his cheekier ideas are showing up on Musk's own Twitter account. He's taking a poll asking whether to delete the \\\"w\\\" in the word Twitter, and as of 11:45 p.m. Sunday, 51% have voted yes, while 49% have voted \\\"of course.\\\" Those were the only options.\\n* He also put out a poll asking whether to convert Twitter's San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter \\\"since no one shows up anyway.\\\" So far, the yes vote has 91.3%, and the no vote has 8.7%.\\n* Musk proposed giving authentication check marks to everyone who signs up for Twitter Blue, a monthly subscription that offers premium features and the ability to customize an individual's experience. They would be different from the check marks for verified accounts or public figures.\\n* Musk also agreed with a user who suggested subscriptions should be cheaper in less affluent countries, saying the cost \\\"should be proportionate to affordability,\\\" Axios reported. \\\"Maybe even an option to pay in Doge?\\\" he mused, referring to the Dogecoin cryptocurrency.\\nWhat's Next: Late Sunday, Agrawal tweeted that Musk told the company on Saturday he wouldn't be joining the board. \\\"I believe this is for the best,\\\" Agrawal said, adding the company remains open to Musk's input as its biggest shareholder.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Janet H.

To prepare for the travel surge, carriers hired more pilots, flight attendants, gate agents, ramp workers, and customer-service representatives, The Wall Street Journal reported.\\n* JetBlue, which grappled with another weekend of flight delays and cancellations, told workers it will cut capacity 8% to 10% in May and by similar levels through the summer even as it braces for a wave of travel demand.\\n* While JetBlue has hired 3,000 more workers, it is still short-staffed. It is competing with Frontier to buy Spirit Airlines. \\\"Based on your feedback that the schedule is wound too tight, we know the best plan is to reduce capacity now,\\\" JetBlue President Joanna Geraghty told staff.\\n* American Airlines hired more than 600 pilots and is focused on supply-chain issues such as catering. Alaska Air Group, Delta Air Lines, and American pilots have picketed in recent weeks, complaining about flight schedules leaving pilots overworked and fatigued, the Journal reported.\\n* Storms in Florida earlier in April forced flight attendants to wait hours for transportation and hotels, and some slept in airports, unions that represent American and Southwest Airlines flight attendants said. Southwest said it is working to improve its contingency planning.\\nWhat's Next: JetBlue is offering $1,000 bonuses to flight attendants who don't call out of work through May 31 and an extra $100 a trip for working on their days off. Southwest raised starting pay to $17 an hour and waived requirements that workers have high school diplomas.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Janet H. Cho\\n***\\nBank Earnings Expected to Reveal Effects of Market Volatility\\nBank earnings are due for the volatile first quarter, when Russia's war on Ukraine began and threw markets and the financial businesses associated with them into disarray. Some banks have already detailed exposure to Russian assets held, but the fallout will likely extend to revenue from deal making and trading.\\n* Big banks are leaving Russia and face losses. Goldman Sachs' credit exposure there was $650 million at the end of 2021, and JPMorgan has said exiting Russia could cost it $1 billion. Citigroup could lose $4 billion.\\n* Equity capital markets, a business that includes initial public offerings, is expected to be weak. Dealogic says revenue is down 75% from the same period last year and 61% from the quarter ending in December. Merger volumes have fallen by one-third the robust level of last year.\\n* Stock trading results could also be blunted, but commodities and currency trading may help offset that. The price of U.S. benchmark crude oil is up 30% so far this year.\\n* JPMorgan kicks off the week on Wednesday, with expected earnings per share of $2.72, while Goldman and Wells Fargo among others come Thursday, with EPS expected to be $8.95 and 82 cents, respectively.\\nWhat's Next: Banks benefit when interest rates rise because they can charge more interest on loans without immediately raising the rates they pay on deposits. The Federal Reserve's meeting in May, when many expect it to bump up rates a half-point, could be a catalyst for bank stocks.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Liz Moyer\\n***\\nMarketWatch Wants to Hear From You\\nWhen does a solo 401(k) make sense for self-employed people, and what are the contribution limits?\\nA MarketWatch correspondent will answer this question soon.

What It Means for the Stock. \\n\",\n          \"The billionaire's surprise move came months after he tried to back out of a $44 billion deal to acquire the company.The monthslong battle over Elon Musk's bid to buy Twitter has been massive in scale and drama. One of the tech industry's biggest deals in recent years, it has captured the public's imagination, with cinematic twists that have been closely followed even by people who have never written a tweet.Now Mr. Musk, in a surprise move, has added another plot turn. After months of trying to get out of a deal that he struck in April, the billionaire made a proposal on Monday night that could bring the acrimonious legal fight to an end.Mr. Musk said he would do exactly what he said he would do in April: Acquire Twitter at $54.20 per share, according to regulatory filings made public on Tuesday.Twitter, which sued Mr. Musk in July to force him to go through with the $44 billion deal, has yet to accept his new proposal and plans to add conditions to try to ensure that he doesn't change his mind again.In a short statement, Twitter said it had received Mr. Musk's letter and reiterated the company's intention to close the deal. Twitter may ask a court in Delaware, where it filed its suit, for protections that would force Mr. Musk to follow through with his new proposal, said three people familiar with the company's plans, who were not authorized to speak publicly about them. The company could also demand that Mr. Musk pay interest on the deal price for the delays in completing the acquisition, one of those people added.A deal would allow both sides to avoid a messy trial that was expected to start in two weeks in Delaware Chancery Court. The trial most likely would have featured testimony from Mr. Musk, who runs the electric automaker Tesla, and senior Twitter executives. Mr. Musk is scheduled to be deposed on Thursday and Friday in Austin, Texas, according to a legal filing.Twitter has barely been profitable for most of its history and is dwarfed in size by other social media platforms like Facebook and the much younger TikTok. But the fight with Mr. Musk has preoccupied Silicon Valley, Wall Street and Washington because Twitter has for years been an online bullhorn for opinionated tech industry billionaires like Mr. Musk and politicians like former President Donald J. Trump, whom the company barred from its platform last year after the Jan. 6 riot on Capitol Hill.If Mr. Musk does take over Twitter, one of his first big moves could be allowing Mr. Trump to return. Mr. Musk has said it was a \\\"mistake\\\" for Twitter to bar Mr. Trump.The potential agreement follows months of disputes that have created existential challenges for Twitter, cratering its share price, demoralizing its employees and spooking the advertisers it relies on for revenue.Mr. Musk, with his repeated, scathing criticism of Twitter and its management, has often seemed more interested in taking a wrecking ball to the company than becoming its new owner. His critics have argued that he has simply been looking for anything to justify backing out of a rash decision that he quickly came to regret.\\\"I think he recognized that litigation is not going well on his part,\\\" said Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at Tulane Law School.A deal at the original price would be a victory for Twitter. Mr. Musk declared in July that he no longer intended to continue with the acquisition because he believed Twitter's service was overrun by spam. Twitter sued him soon after.Mr. Musk submitted his latest proposal to Twitter on Monday evening, informing the company that he intended to proceed with his original offer. \\\"We write to notify you that the Musk parties intend to proceed to closing of the transaction,\\\" a lawyer for Mr. Musk wrote in the letter, according to a regulatory filing. The letter asked that the court battle be paused, pending the closing of the deal.The two sides met in court in an emergency virtual hearing on Tuesday to discuss the proposal before Kathaleen McCormick, the judge overseeing the trial. The proposal was reported earlier by Bloomberg.Lawyers for Mr. Musk and Twitter were expected to meet again in court later on Tuesday to discuss next steps, the person said. If they opt to proceed with the sale of Twitter, a deal could possibly close within weeks, or as soon as Mr. Musk hands over the $44 billion.Twitter may request that Mr. Musk agree to have the court supervise the deal's closing, three people familiar with the matter said. The company may also ask Mr. Musk to pay a daily interest fee for every day that has passed since shareholders approved the deal on Sept. 13, one of those people said.\\\"Procedurally, Twitter has done everything they need to do to close this deal,\\\" said Brian J.M. Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School. If the company accepts Mr. Musk's proposal, it could request that the trial be postponed until the deal is completed, Mr. Quinn said. Once the acquisition is completed, Twitter will most likely dismiss its lawsuit against Mr. Musk.On Tuesday evening, Mr. Musk tweeted that \\\"buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.\\\" X is the name of holding company that Mr. Musk formed to buy Twitter.Shares in the social media company spiked more than 12 percent on the news of Mr. Musk's latest offer, before a halt in trading. Trading resumed in the afternoon, and Twitter's share price closed at $52, a 22 percent increase.The economic backdrop has changed significantly since Mr. Musk announced his intent to buy Twitter last spring. Amid inflation and geopolitical uncertainty, investors are facing the kinds of losses they haven't seen since 2009. That has also made it more difficult to finance deals.Investment banks, led by Morgan Stanley, have already agreed to help finance the deal with about $13 billion in debt. The banks remain on the hook until April, according to the terms of their contract.Mr. Musk has said he would finance the rest of the deal in cash. In April, he sold about $8.5 billion shares in Tesla to help fund the deal; in May, he said he had lined up about $7 billion in cash from an array of investors including the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and the tech mogul Larry Ellison. It was not immediately clear what commitments those investors had to Mr. Musk.In August, Mr. Musk sold an additional $7 billion worth of Tesla's stock in \\\"the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close and some equity partners don't come through,\\\" he wrote at the time.Twitter employees learned of Mr. Musk's proposal from media reports while participating in a companywide meeting about corporate plans for 2023 on Tuesday, reigniting confusion and speculation that have roiled Twitter's work force over the past six months, four employees said.Parag Agrawal, Twitter's chief executive, did not immediately address Mr. Musk's offer with employees, those people added. Sean Edgett, Twitter's general counsel, said in an email to employees on Tuesday afternoon, \\\"I will continue to keep you posted on significant updates, but in the meantime, thank you for your patience as we work through this on the legal side.\\\"On the internal Slack messaging system on Tuesday, employees discussed the implications for the company, their jobs and their stock compensation. In a channel with nearly 2,000 members that is used to joke about company news, some wondered what would happen if Twitter's board did not accept Mr. Musk's renewed offer. Some speculated that Twitter's stock would plummet, while another, referring to Mr. Musk, said the company would not have to be owned by \\\"a moron.\\\"While an agreement would signify an end to the uncertainty clouding Twitter's immediate future, Mr. Musk's plans for the company are not clear. He told investors before trying to back out of the deal that by 2025, he could get the company to 500 million daily users and revenue of $13.2 billion.Twitter and Mr. Musk were set for a showdown this month in a Delaware courtroom. The company argued in legal filings that Mr. Musk's reasons for abandoning the deal were smoke screens, and suggested that he had simply hoped for a lower price after stock market declines decreased his wealth.Mr. Musk said Twitter had most likely undercounted the amount of spam on its platform, making the company less valuable than he initially believed. He also cited whistle-blower claims from a former Twitter executive, who said the company had misled regulators about its security practices, as a reason to exit the deal.Ryan Mac contributed reporting.Ryan Mac contributed reporting.PhotographElon Musk, center, has agreed to acquire Twitter at $54.20 per share, the same price he agreed to in April before getting cold feet.

Tesla shares jumped more than 9 percent Monday morning on the news, pushing the company s market cap to $1.17 trillion. The vast majority (90 percent) of Tesla s 2021 deliveries were Model 3 and Model Y.

            "8-Jan-22 - Tesla's New Austin Factory to Start Up Soon. It's Going to Be Wild. - Christmas arrived a little late for Tesla bulls. They have been eagerly awaiting the start-up of new manufacturing capacity. Now the start-up is imminent. Saturday, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote that Tesla's (ticker: TSLA) new facility in Austin, Texas, known as Gigafactory Texas, will begin production in about a week. That means more Model Y crossover vehicles and, just as important, that the Cybertruck will be arriving on U.S. roads shortly. \"Based on our analysis of Giga Austin it appears paperwork is now clearing the way for Model Y production starting over the next 7 to 10 days,\" wrote Ives. \"Launching the Austin production in early January is very important to Tesla expanding both domestic and global production of Model Y's which are set to have a massive year in 2022.\" Tesla delivered more than 936,000 vehicles in 2021. The vast majority more than 911,000 were Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossover vehicles. Tesla doesn't provide a more detailed breakdown. The Model 3 and Y are Tesla's lower-priced, higher-volume Models. The Model Y is the hottest seller right now and CEO Elon Musk has high hopes for the vehicle. \"We think the Model Y will be the best-selling vehicle of any kind globally,\" said Elon Musk, referring to 2023, at the company's annual meeting held in Austin back in October. \"We need Austin to get online and Berlin to get online and reach volume production, and then I think that's going to happen.\" Wall Street expects Tesla to deliver 1.4 million units in 2022, up 55% compared with 2021. Tesla has given volume guidance, but it is really more like a goal. The company says it wants to grow volume at 50% a year for the foreseeable future. Volumes rose 87% in 2021 compared with 2020. The pace at which production ramps up at Austin will go a long way to determining if Tesla can hit its 50% growth goal this year. Tesla's other new plant, in Berlin, Germany, is also about to start up production. That plant will produce Model Y crossover vehicles to start, like Texas. It should be a wild year for Tesla, which is essentially doubling production capacity, going from two plants to four. Tesla also makes cars in Fremont, Calif., and Shanghai, China. The two new plants means a lot will change. Profit margins will change as European volumes are delivered from Europe instead of from China. In addition to the Model Y, the Austin plant will make the light-duty pickup truck called Cybertruck . That will compete with Ford Motor's (F) all-electric F-150 Lightning in an important vehicle segment in the U.S., where pickup trucks account for 20% of all new vehicle sales. And, of course, investors will watch closely to see if Tesla can sell all its cars as it produces more and as other auto makers, such as Ford with its electric truck, bring more EV models to the market. Tesla stock rose 50% in 2021 as it delivered more cars than expected. It will probably take another delivery \"beat,\" better than 1.4 million, to keep the stock working higher in 2022. Tesla stock opened the year up 13% Monday, Jan. 3, after better-than-expected delivery numbers were released on Jan. 2. Then shares sold off amid a broader tech rout. Investors were spooked by the Federal Reserve's December meeting minutes, which indicated it was committed to raising interest rates. Higher interest rates especially hurt highly valued growth stocks, as the future profits investors are betting on will be worth less. Tesla stock is now down 2.8% year to date. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite are down 1.9%, 0.3%, and 4.5%, respectively. Tesla's New Austin Factory to Start Up Soon. It's Going to Be Wild. Credit: Al Root\n",

            "13-Jan-22 - Elon Musk, Hollywood Actors Criticize California's Plan to Cut Solar Subsidies; State's public utilities commission says proposal balances power grid, environment and consumers' needs; critics say it hampers environmental progress - A proposal to cut incentives for rooftop solar power in California has drawn criticism from some environmentalists, Hollywood stars and business leaders, including Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk. The proposal by the California Public Utilities Commission would add monthly fees for solar customers while also reducing payments to customers for any extra power they generate and supply to the grid, which is known as net metering. Critics say the plan threatens to derail environmental progress in the state. The CPUC, in its proposal, said the current energy-metering structure isn't cost-effective and hurts customers who don't participate in the solar program as well as low-income ratepayers. The rule changes \"ensures all customers pay for their usage of the grid,\" the proposal says. More than one million California customers have solar systems installed, according to the CPUC. Since rooftop solar customers pay less in utility bills, they end up contributing less toward maintaining the grid, which they still use. The cost burden is thus often shifted to power customers without rooftop solar, according to the proposal. Various groups peg that cost shift at between $1 billion and $3.4 billion a year. The proposed change to the net metering rules \"balances the needs of the electric grid, the environment, and consumers,\" a CPUC spokeswoman said Thursday. CPUC said a proposed decision may be heard, at the earliest, at its Jan. 27 voting meeting. If the proposal passes, it would take new residential solar customers about 11 years to make back their upfront investment in solar panels through reduced electricity bills, a jump from the roughly six to seven years it currently takes, according to BloombergNEF estimates. Mr. Musk on Twitter called the proposal a \"bizarre anti-environment move.\" Tesla launched a webpage that calls on Gov. Gavin Newsom and the CPUC to reject \"the proposed solar tax,\" and instructs visitors on how to submit feedback to the relevant public bodies and officials. Mr. Musk's Tesla has a financial incentive to oppose the CPUC proposal. Tesla invests in solar energy with its green energy subsidiary, Tesla Energy. It sells solar panels and battery systems that store solar energy. Tesla purchased solar-energy company SolarCity Corp. in 2016. Tesla representatives didn't respond Thursday to a request for comment. Some environmental groups and Hollywood celebrities have voiced concerns, saying the rooftop solar market is key to the state meeting its climate goals. Actor Edward Norton said the proposal comes while California is \"burning & drying out due to climate change.\" The CPUC proposal says the net-energy metering program \"has and should continue to assist the State in meeting its energy and climate goals.\" \"However, because the Commission is mandated to create a tariff that adheres to the entire statute including equity concerns the growth of the market should not come at the undue and burdensome financial expense of nonparticipant Ratepayers,\" it said. Mr. Newsom said at a press conference earlier this week that \"we still have some work to do,\" regarding the proposal. A spokesman for the Democratic governor said that the CPUC is an independent commission, which will ultimately decide on the matter. \"In the meantime, Governor Newsom continues to move forward with his commitment to California's clean energy goals, which includes the ability for Californians to access a diverse range of renewable energy sources,\" the spokesman said.

            "14-Jan-22 - Elon Musk-Backed EV Battery Technology Rises to Dominance in China; Tesla, Chinese makers take lead over rivals in using less-expensive iron in place of nickel - A less-expensive battery technology championed by Tesla Inc.'s Elon Musk rose to dominate the world's largest auto market last year, pointing to challenges for Tesla's U.S. and European rivals. Official Chinese figures showed that batteries using lithium iron phosphate or LFP technology accounted for 57% of total battery production for vehicles in China during 2021, up from less than half the previous year. The LFP batteries have stormed into the lead in China because they use relatively inexpensive iron in the battery's cathode in place of costlier metals such as nickel. Their rise has coincided with the emergence of electric vehicles as a mass-market product in China. In 2021, new-energy vehicles, a category that mostly consists of EVs, accounted for nearly one in six passenger cars sold in China , the world's top auto market by number of vehicles sold. As Chinese car dealers sell more EVs and a greater proportion of those EVs carry LFP batteries, production of the iron batteries is surging. In 2021, Chinese battery makers produced LFP batteries with 125.4 gigawatt-hours of capacity, more than triple the figure from a year earlier, said the government-backed China Automotive Battery Research Institute. U.S. and European car companies traditionally frowned on LFP batteries because they tend to have lower energy density than nickel-based batteries, meaning the cars they power can't travel as far on a single charge. LFP batteries also are more likely to suffer from poor performance in cold weather. Over the last two decades, Chinese companies trying to catch up with Japan and the U.S. in battery technology focused on improving LFP technology, not only because of the cost but also because the batteries are less likely to catch fire. A change in Chinese government EV subsidies, which previously favored longer-range cars, also helped the technology gain an edge. One of the strongest advocates is Tesla's Mr. Musk, who has said that finding enough nickel at reasonable cost is a major production concern. He has pushed back against the idea that customers buying an LFP car are getting a second-class product. \"Our intent with this pack is that product experience is roughly equivalent between nickel & iron,\" Mr. Musk wrote on Twitter last August to a customer who was offered earlier delivery of a Tesla if he chose the LFP option. \"I'd personally slightly opt for iron pack, as it wants to be charged to 100% whereas nickel prefers ~90%,\" Mr. Musk said in the Twitter post. Car makers in the U.S., Europe and Japan are all stepping up battery production and many are working on LFP technology, but they generally haven't gotten as far as Tesla and Chinese makers in bringing the technology into mass-market production. Tesla first used LFP batteries for its China-made Model 3 in 2020. Last October, the company said it would extend the use of the iron-based batteries to all of its standard-range cars. China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., the world's biggest maker of electric-vehicle batteries, supplies Tesla with LFP batteries. Other Chinese electric vehicle brands are also becoming heavy users of LFP cathodes. The Hong Guang Mini, a tiny hatchback costing as little as $4,400, was China's bestselling EV in 2021. It is made by a joint venture of General Motors Co. and two other Chinese companies. Warren Buffett-backed BYD Co. Ltd., a Chinese company that makes both electric vehicles and the batteries that go into them, has designed an LFP battery in a blade shape. It says its design has higher energy density to give EVs longer range. \"Almost all the car brands you can think of are in talks with us about cooperation based on blade battery technologies,\" BYD's Vice President He Long said last year when announcing the battery, according to the company's social-media account.

            "17-Jan-22 - Smart progressives should love Elon Musk - Nearly everything Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted about Elon Musk was wrong. Scratch the word nearly. Everything was wrong. Last month, the senator from Massachusetts tweeted, Let s change the rigged tax code so the Person of the Year will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everyone else. Some background: The founder of Tesla had just been anointed the richest human on earth, and Time Magazine named him Person of the Year. Three months before, SpaceX, which he also founded, sent the first all-civilian crew into space. Musk tweeted back to Warren, And if you opened your eyes for 2 seconds, you would realize I will pay more taxes than any American in history this year. He s put the number at something north of $11 billion, which, if true, would be more taxes than any other American paid ever. Whether Musk s tax bill should have been higher can be subject for debate. We can agree that $11 billion is a healthy tax bill, but it s not an unseemly sum for one enjoying a net worth of around $243 billion. Warren s implication that Musk doesn t pay taxes at all, however, is ignorant. The charge that he s freeloading if you look at how he made that money is awe-inspiring dumb. Musk has done more than any person on earth to replace cars run by the internal combustion engine, a significant factor in the climate crisis, with clean electric vehicles. In 2020, when General Motors and Ford were closing factories because they couldn t find enough specialized computer chips, Tesla took the chips that were around and rewrote software to make them work in its cars. So while Ford, GM and Stellantis (Fiat Chrysler merged with Peugeot) sold fewer cars in 2021 than the year before, Tesla sold 87% more. Six years ago, when the major U.S. carmakers were wondering whether or not to go big on electric, Tesla was building a huge battery factory in Nevada. The others are now in the game major league, and Tesla can be credited with pushing them. But in the marathon race to win the electric vehicle market, Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said, Tesla is in the lead at mile number 21. Everybody else is at mile 2 or still tying their shoes. So Musk is full of himself. He has reasons. What bothers some 20th-century progressives is that Musk is an unapologetic capitalist who mocks them for obsessing on his wealth. Leading the pack is Sen. Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator s brain has long been stalled on the subject of billionaires whom he once said shouldn t exist. When he tweeted, We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share. Period, Musk trolled him: I keep forgetting that you re still alive. Musk may not be volunteering to pay more taxes than he has to, but we who think the superrich should pay more must understand that the solution is not them, but the tax laws. The tax code is the creation of Congress. Back to Warren. As we face the existential threat of our time climate change, she wrote as a presidential candidate, Wall Street is refusing to listen, let alone take real action. Wrong again. Actually, Wall Street has been moving away from investments in fossil fuels to the point that Texas passed a law banning companies that refuse to finance oil ventures from state contracts. It is Wall Street that rewarded Musk for accelerating the changeover to electric vehicles. (Tesla also has a thriving solar panel business.) If helping save the planet let Musk edge out Amazon s Jeff Bezos as the world s richest person, well, where s the problem? (Harrop is a writer for Creators Syndicate)\n",

It also slightly reduces the amount of cash Musk needs to put up personally.\\nCNBC reported that Musk is expected to serve as temporary chief executive of Twitter for a \\\"few months,\\\" after he completes the deal.\\nSaudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, chairman of the board at Kingdom Holding Co., made the biggest contribution, agreeing to commit almost 35 million shares in Twitter -- worth $1.9 billion -- to retain a stake in the company after Musk's takeover, according to an amended securities filing Thursday morning.\\nEllison, the co-founder of Oracle Corp. who has a big stake in Tesla and a seat on its board, committed $1 billion through his trust.\\nOther investors named in the filing Thursday include the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance Holdings Ltd., Brookfield Asset Management, Fidelity Management & Research and Qatar Holding.\\nChangpeng Zhao, chief executive of Binance, which promised $500 million, tweeted that it was \\\"a small contribution to the cause.\\\"\\nWith the financing picture becoming clearer, the market seems to be coming around to the idea that the deal will close.\\nThe gap between Twitter's stock price and the $54.20 per share that Musk offered to pay for the company is at its narrowest point since April 26. Twitter shares rose 2.7% to $50.36 on Thursday.\\nThe deal is set to close later this year, and the two sides have each agreed to pay a $1-billion breakup fee if it falls apart.\\nThe world's wealthiest person reached an agreement April 25 to acquire Twitter using a financing plan that has alarmed some Tesla investors.\\nIn addition to pledging tens of billions of dollars' worth of his Tesla shares to support margin loans, Musk vowed to line up some $21 billion of equity.\\nThat number has risen to $27.25 billion, according to Thursday's filing. Musk has sold more than $8.5 billion of Tesla stock to finance the deal.\\n\\\"In this game of high stakes poker, Ellison and the impressive list of backers will remove more of an overhang from Tesla shares as the Musk leverage of shares now becomes less onerous,\\\" said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush. \\\"This was a smart financial and strategic move by Musk that will be well received across the board.\\\"\\nMusk's latest backers include a bevy of traditional asset managers, venture capital firms, boutique hedge funds and one of the world's largest pools of capital.\\nQatar Holding, a unit of the nation's wealth fund, has agreed to commit $375 million.\\nAlwaleed previously rejected Musk's bid, stating that it failed to come \\\"close to the intrinsic value of Twitter.\\\"\\nMusk is also in discussions with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey on contributing some of his shares toward the acquisition.\\nEllison, 77, is the richest person in the group besides Musk. The corporate software titan has a net worth of $95.6 billion, placing him 11th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\\nHe's not an active Twitter user -- his only tweet was a decade ago -- but he does share some of Musk's political views. Ellison is a major Republican donor and hosted a fundraiser for former President Trump in 2020.\\nSilicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who has publicly feuded with Dorsey on Twitter, has agreed to commit $400 million via his fund Andreessen Horowitz, known as a16z. Fellow venture firm Sequoia Capital is putting up $800 million.\\nBen Horowitz, a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, cited the work of Twitter founders Evan Williams and Dorsey as a reason the firm invested.\\n\\\"We believe in EV and Jack's vision to connect the world and we believe in Elon's brilliance to finally make it what it was meant to be,\\\" Horowitz said.\\nSeveral Tesla investors are among those committing support for Musk's Twitter bid, including Ellison, who owns 1.45% of the carmaker's outstanding shares, and Fidelity Management & Research Co., which owns about 1%. Both are among Tesla's biggest investors.\\nSmaller investors include Witkoff Capital, real estate tycoon Steven Witkoff's firm, and Cartenna Capital, a hedge fund set up by Peter Avellone, a former Millennium Management portfolio manager.\\nMusk had been building up a stake in Twitter since early this year, eventually amassing more than 9% of the company and becoming its largest individual shareholder.\\nHe was offered a seat on the board, which he turned down because of the restrictions it would have placed on him for buying more shares. Instead, he made a formal offer for Twitter on April 14, subject to financing that wasn't immediately spelled out.\\nWith more than 90 million followers on Twitter, Musk is one of the platform's most prominent and outspoken users.\\nHe is known for sometimes cryptic or mysterious tweets, lobbed at all hours of the day, on topics as diverse as cryptocurrencies, space travel and whether Twitter should have an edit button.\\nSome of the ideas he has thrown out for Twitter include that it limit advertising, open-source its algorithm and do more to emphasize free-speech principles.\\nCaption: PHOTO: ORACLE CO-FOUNDER Larry Ellison, above in 2019, is among investors who agreed to bankroll the Twitter deal. He committed $1 billion through his trust.\\nPHOTOGRAPHER:Justin Sullivan Getty Images\\nCredit: Turner and Chan write for Bloomberg.\",\n          \"Elon Musk will no longer join the board of Twitter, just days after the company announced his appointment.\\nThe rapid U-turn was quickly reflected in the share price movement as the social-media company's stock fell more than 4% in premarket trading Monday.\\nInvestors hoping that Musk's influence at a board level would bring about change were clearly disappointed. But it's far from the end of the story. Musk remains Twitter's largest shareholder after taking a 9.2% stake, and he hasn't been shy when it comes to raising potential changes to the platform, even if some have been on the jokey side.\\nBut his sudden decision, announced by Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and, oddly, not by the man himself, does cast doubt on where the billionaire's journey with the social-media giant will end up. Agrawal stated the board appointment was contingent on a background check and \\\"formal acceptance,\\\" adding that Musk informed the company on Saturday he would no longer be joining the board.\\nAs for Musk, his intentions have never been that clear, although a poll on removing the edit button and posts about free speech have offered clues.\\nBut the stock, which surged 27% on its best ever day last week , is still around 13% higher than it was before Musk disclosed his stake, even factoring in Monday's early fall.\\nRegardless of his next move, or the level of influence he might have, the Tesla CEO's very presence as Twitter's largest shareholder will keep management on its toes. Investors want the company's financial results to be in line with the chirpiness of its leading shareholder.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Callum Keown\\n*** Join Barron's senior managing editor Lauren R.

And his more than 81 million followers are listening.\\n* Some of his cheekier ideas are showing up on Musk's own Twitter account. He's taking a poll asking whether to delete the \\\"w\\\" in the word Twitter, and as of 11:45 p.m. Sunday, 51% have voted yes, while 49% have voted \\\"of course.\\\" Those were the only options.\\n* He also put out a poll asking whether to convert Twitter's San Francisco headquarters into a homeless shelter \\\"since no one shows up anyway.\\\" So far, the yes vote has 91.3%, and the no vote has 8.7%.\\n* Musk proposed giving authentication check marks to everyone who signs up for Twitter Blue, a monthly subscription that offers premium features and the ability to customize an individual's experience. They would be different from the check marks for verified accounts or public figures.\\n* Musk also agreed with a user who suggested subscriptions should be cheaper in less affluent countries, saying the cost \\\"should be proportionate to affordability,\\\" Axios reported. \\\"Maybe even an option to pay in Doge?\\\" he mused, referring to the Dogecoin cryptocurrency.\\nWhat's Next: Late Sunday, Agrawal tweeted that Musk told the company on Saturday he wouldn't be joining the board. \\\"I believe this is for the best,\\\" Agrawal said, adding the company remains open to Musk's input as its biggest shareholder.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Janet H.

Cho\\n***\\nBank Earnings Expected to Reveal Effects of Market Volatility\\nBank earnings are due for the volatile first quarter, when Russia's war on Ukraine began and threw markets and the financial businesses associated with them into disarray. Some banks have already detailed exposure to Russian assets held, but the fallout will likely extend to revenue from deal making and trading.\\n* Big banks are leaving Russia and face losses. Goldman Sachs' credit exposure there was $650 million at the end of 2021, and JPMorgan has said exiting Russia could cost it $1 billion. Citigroup could lose $4 billion.\\n* Equity capital markets, a business that includes initial public offerings, is expected to be weak. Dealogic says revenue is down 75% from the same period last year and 61% from the quarter ending in December. Merger volumes have fallen by one-third the robust level of last year.\\n* Stock trading results could also be blunted, but commodities and currency trading may help offset that. The price of U.S. benchmark crude oil is up 30% so far this year.\\n* JPMorgan kicks off the week on Wednesday, with expected earnings per share of $2.72, while Goldman and Wells Fargo among others come Thursday, with EPS expected to be $8.95 and 82 cents, respectively.\\nWhat's Next: Banks benefit when interest rates rise because they can charge more interest on loans without immediately raising the rates they pay on deposits. The Federal Reserve's meeting in May, when many expect it to bump up rates a half-point, could be a catalyst for bank stocks.\\n\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0094Liz Moyer\\n***\\nMarketWatch Wants to Hear From You\\nWhen does a solo 401(k) make sense for self-employed people, and what are the contribution limits?\\nA MarketWatch correspondent will answer this question soon.

What It Means for the Stock. \\n\",\n          \"The billionaire's surprise move came months after he tried to back out of a $44 billion deal to acquire the company.The monthslong battle over Elon Musk's bid to buy Twitter has been massive in scale and drama. One of the tech industry's biggest deals in recent years, it has captured the public's imagination, with cinematic twists that have been closely followed even by people who have never written a tweet.Now Mr. Musk, in a surprise move, has added another plot turn. After months of trying to get out of a deal that he struck in April, the billionaire made a proposal on Monday night that could bring the acrimonious legal fight to an end.Mr. Musk said he would do exactly what he said he would do in April: Acquire Twitter at $54.20 per share, according to regulatory filings made public on Tuesday.Twitter, which sued Mr. Musk in July to force him to go through with the $44 billion deal, has yet to accept his new proposal and plans to add conditions to try to ensure that he doesn't change his mind again.In a short statement, Twitter said it had received Mr. Musk's letter and reiterated the company's intention to close the deal. Twitter may ask a court in Delaware, where it filed its suit, for protections that would force Mr. Musk to follow through with his new proposal, said three people familiar with the company's plans, who were not authorized to speak publicly about them. The company could also demand that Mr. Musk pay interest on the deal price for the delays in completing the acquisition, one of those people added.A deal would allow both sides to avoid a messy trial that was expected to start in two weeks in Delaware Chancery Court. The trial most likely would have featured testimony from Mr. Musk, who runs the electric automaker Tesla, and senior Twitter executives. Mr. Musk is scheduled to be deposed on Thursday and Friday in Austin, Texas, according to a legal filing.Twitter has barely been profitable for most of its history and is dwarfed in size by other social media platforms like Facebook and the much younger TikTok. But the fight with Mr. Musk has preoccupied Silicon Valley, Wall Street and Washington because Twitter has for years been an online bullhorn for opinionated tech industry billionaires like Mr. Musk and politicians like former President Donald J. Trump, whom the company barred from its platform last year after the Jan. 6 riot on Capitol Hill.If Mr. Musk does take over Twitter, one of his first big moves could be allowing Mr. Trump to return. Mr. Musk has said it was a \\\"mistake\\\" for Twitter to bar Mr. Trump.The potential agreement follows months of disputes that have created existential challenges for Twitter, cratering its share price, demoralizing its employees and spooking the advertisers it relies on for revenue.Mr. Musk, with his repeated, scathing criticism of Twitter and its management, has often seemed more interested in taking a wrecking ball to the company than becoming its new owner. His critics have argued that he has simply been looking for anything to justify backing out of a rash decision that he quickly came to regret.\\\"I think he recognized that litigation is not going well on his part,\\\" said Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at Tulane Law School.A deal at the original price would be a victory for Twitter. Mr. Musk declared in July that he no longer intended to continue with the acquisition because he believed Twitter's service was overrun by spam. Twitter sued him soon after.Mr. Musk submitted his latest proposal to Twitter on Monday evening, informing the company that he intended to proceed with his original offer. \\\"We write to notify you that the Musk parties intend to proceed to closing of the transaction,\\\" a lawyer for Mr. Musk wrote in the letter, according to a regulatory filing. The letter asked that the court battle be paused, pending the closing of the deal.The two sides met in court in an emergency virtual hearing on Tuesday to discuss the proposal before Kathaleen McCormick, the judge overseeing the trial. The proposal was reported earlier by Bloomberg.Lawyers for Mr. Musk and Twitter were expected to meet again in court later on Tuesday to discuss next steps, the person said. If they opt to proceed with the sale of Twitter, a deal could possibly close within weeks, or as soon as Mr. Musk hands over the $44 billion.Twitter may request that Mr. Musk agree to have the court supervise the deal's closing, three people familiar with the matter said. The company may also ask Mr. Musk to pay a daily interest fee for every day that has passed since shareholders approved the deal on Sept. 13, one of those people said.\\\"Procedurally, Twitter has done everything they need to do to close this deal,\\\" said Brian J.M. Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School. If the company accepts Mr. Musk's proposal, it could request that the trial be postponed until the deal is completed, Mr. Quinn said. Once the acquisition is completed, Twitter will most likely dismiss its lawsuit against Mr. Musk.On Tuesday evening, Mr. Musk tweeted that \\\"buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.\\\" X is the name of holding company that Mr. Musk formed to buy Twitter.Shares in the social media company spiked more than 12 percent on the news of Mr. Musk's latest offer, before a halt in trading. Trading resumed in the afternoon, and Twitter's share price closed at $52, a 22 percent increase.The economic backdrop has changed significantly since Mr. Musk announced his intent to buy Twitter last spring. Amid inflation and geopolitical uncertainty, investors are facing the kinds of losses they haven't seen since 2009. That has also made it more difficult to finance deals.Investment banks, led by Morgan Stanley, have already agreed to help finance the deal with about $13 billion in debt. The banks remain on the hook until April, according to the terms of their contract.Mr. Musk has said he would finance the rest of the deal in cash. In April, he sold about $8.5 billion shares in Tesla to help fund the deal; in May, he said he had lined up about $7 billion in cash from an array of investors including the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and the tech mogul Larry Ellison. It was not immediately clear what commitments those investors had to Mr. Musk.In August, Mr. Musk sold an additional $7 billion worth of Tesla's stock in \\\"the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close and some equity partners don't come through,\\\" he wrote at the time.Twitter employees learned of Mr. Musk's proposal from media reports while participating in a companywide meeting about corporate plans for 2023 on Tuesday, reigniting confusion and speculation that have roiled Twitter's work force over the past six months, four employees said.Parag Agrawal, Twitter's chief executive, did not immediately address Mr. Musk's offer with employees, those people added. Sean Edgett, Twitter's general counsel, said in an email to employees on Tuesday afternoon, \\\"I will continue to keep you posted on significant updates, but in the meantime, thank you for your patience as we work through this on the legal side.\\\"On the internal Slack messaging system on Tuesday, employees discussed the implications for the company, their jobs and their stock compensation. In a channel with nearly 2,000 members that is used to joke about company news, some wondered what would happen if Twitter's board did not accept Mr. Musk's renewed offer. Some speculated that Twitter's stock would plummet, while another, referring to Mr. Musk, said the company would not have to be owned by \\\"a moron.\\\"While an agreement would signify an end to the uncertainty clouding Twitter's immediate future, Mr. Musk's plans for the company are not clear. He told investors before trying to back out of the deal that by 2025, he could get the company to 500 million daily users and revenue of $13.2 billion.Twitter and Mr. Musk were set for a showdown this month in a Delaware courtroom. The company argued in legal filings that Mr. Musk's reasons for abandoning the deal were smoke screens, and suggested that he had simply hoped for a lower price after stock market declines decreased his wealth.Mr. Musk said Twitter had most likely undercounted the amount of spam on its platform, making the company less valuable than he initially believed. He also cited whistle-blower claims from a former Twitter executive, who said the company had misled regulators about its security practices, as a reason to exit the deal.Ryan Mac contributed reporting.Ryan Mac contributed reporting.PhotographElon Musk, center, has agreed to acquire Twitter at $54.20 per share, the same price he agreed to in April before getting cold feet.

Quinn says that though potential acquirers often have buyer's remorse after signing a deal shortly before a market slide, the way the merger agreement is structured, that doesn't count for anything. He says if Musk tries to walk away, Twitter has the option to take Musk to court instead of accepting a $1 billion breakup fee.\\nIf Twitter can prove to a Delaware court that Musk's financing is still in place, the court could issue an order for specific performance that would compel Musk to close the merger, Quinn says.\\n\\\"A Delaware court that looks at this merger agreement will give an order for specific performance if this deal is capable of being closed,\\\" Quinn says. \\\"And if Musk just says 'I'm not going to do it,' they will get the order and they'll force him to close.\\\"\\nMerger arbitrage traders are still skeptical.

A live-stream is expected to begin around 5 p.m. local time, according to PepsiCo. Mr. Musk has said he plans to attend.\\nThe Tesla chief executive introduced the concept in 2017 as Tesla was struggling to mass-produce its Model 3 sedan, promising a truck that would travel 500 miles on a single charge and be cheaper to operate than a diesel competitor.\\nThis year, Tesla's stock is down around 45% through Thursday as the company grapples with greater competition, regulatory scrutiny and investor unease over Mr. Musk's acquisition of Twitter Inc. Tesla's stock-price decline has eclipsed that of other major auto makers, as well as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index.\\nTesla didn't respond to a request for comment on issues including the number of trucks it plans to deliver to PepsiCo and their price tag.\\nPepsiCo declined to comment on those topics. The company has said the trucks would support plants in Sacramento and Modesto, Calif. A typical diesel-powered semitrailer truck costs around $120,000 in the U.S., according to consulting firm Roland Berger.\\nPepsiCo's Frito-Lay unit has teamed up with a local public health agency to replace its diesel-powered freight equipment in Modesto with 15 Tesla semitrailer trucks, among other vehicles and equipment. The California Air Resources Board has committed to funding half of that $30.8 million overhaul.\\nTesla's planned delivery of its Semi comes after President Biden in August signed into law legislation creating a new tax credit of up to $40,000 for commercial electric vehicles beginning in 2023, among other incentives.\\n EV Rivals Aiming for Tesla's Crown in China \\nSeveral other companies, including Daimler Truck Holding AG and Volvo AB, have been developing electric semitrailer trucks, though the market remains nascent. The scarcity of charging infrastructure capable of powering up heavy trucks means they are better suited for shorter trips close to a central hub than they are for long-haul routes, said Wilfried Aulbur, who runs Roland Berger's commercial-vehicle-consulting practice.\\nTesla's Semi is unusual in that it was designed from the ground-up to be electric, rather than being a modified version of a diesel truck, Dr. Aulbur said.\\nThe Semi will be capable of accelerating from zero to 60 miles an hour in 20 seconds and recharging up to 70% of its range in half an hour, Tesla says on its website. In keeping with Tesla's propensity for unusual design elements, the Semi's cab features a single, centrally located seat. The steering wheel is flanked by two display screens.\\n\\\"By removing the motor and the transmission in front of the vehicle, we could put the driver in the middle for the best command view,\\\" Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla's chief designer, recently told CNBC .\\nTesla is aiming to produce 50,000 Semi trucks in 2024 in North America, Mr. Musk said in October. He previously said battery-cell supply constraints made scaling truck production difficult. For now, output remains limited. Tesla might produce 100 semitrailer trucks this year, Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm said during a recent trial over Mr. Musk's compensation package at Tesla. Internal projections from early 2018 contemplated producing thousands of the trucks, she said.\\nThursday's event comes as Tesla pushes to deliver as many vehicles as possible in the final weeks of the year. The company cut its annual growth expectations this fall, saying it expects to finish the year just shy of its 2022 target of boosting vehicle deliveries by 50%.\\nTesla is offering a $3,750 credit to U.S. customers who buy certain Model 3s or Model Ys for delivery this month, according to the company's website.\\nMr. Musk, who runs Twitter and rocket company SpaceX in addition to Tesla, has said he has been spending much of his time recently running the social-media company. At Twitter, Mr. Musk has encountered some challenges engaging with consumer brands. Many have paused advertising on the platform , citing concern over how it would evolve under Mr. Musk.

Write to Al Root at [email protected] Elon Musk's Twitter Stake Is Forcing Tesla Investors to Consider the Key-Man Risk Credit: Al Root\",\n          \"1-Dec-22 - Tesla Set to Deliver Semi Truck to PepsiCo, Expanding Beyond Passenger Vehicles; Car company is slated to host event Thursday to mark the occasion - Tesla Inc. is poised to deliver its first all-electric semitrailer truck Thursday, marking the company's long-delayed expansion beyond the passenger vehicle market. Food and beverage maker PepsiCo Inc. is expected to take delivery of the Semi, five years after Elon Musk revealed the model. The Semi, originally due out in 2019, would be the first new model Tesla is putting in customer hands since early 2020, when the company began delivering its Model Y crossover. Tesla is slated to host an event to mark the occasion in the Reno, Nev., area, where it has been producing the Semi and jointly operates a battery factory. A live-stream is expected to begin around 5 p.m. local time, according to PepsiCo. Mr. Musk has said he plans to attend. The Tesla chief executive introduced the concept in 2017 as Tesla was struggling to mass-produce its Model 3 sedan, promising a truck that would travel 500 miles on a single charge and be cheaper to operate than a diesel competitor. This year, Tesla's stock is down around 45% through Thursday as the company grapples with greater competition, regulatory scrutiny and investor unease over Mr. Musk's acquisition of Twitter Inc. Tesla's stock-price decline has eclipsed that of other major auto makers, as well as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index. Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on issues including the number of trucks it plans to deliver to PepsiCo and their price tag. PepsiCo declined to comment on those topics. The company has said the trucks would support plants in Sacramento and Modesto, Calif. A typical diesel-powered semitrailer truck costs around $120,000 in the U.S., according to consulting firm Roland Berger. PepsiCo's Frito-Lay unit has teamed up with a local public health agency to replace its diesel-powered freight equipment in Modesto with 15 Tesla semitrailer trucks, among other vehicles and equipment. The California Air Resources Board has committed to funding half of that $30.8 million overhaul. Tesla's planned delivery of its Semi comes after President Biden in August signed into law legislation creating a new tax credit of up to $40,000 for commercial electric vehicles beginning in 2023, among other incentives. EV Rivals Aiming for Tesla's Crown in China Several other companies, including Daimler Truck Holding AG and Volvo AB, have been developing electric semitrailer trucks, though the market remains nascent. The scarcity of charging infrastructure capable of powering up heavy trucks means they are better suited for shorter trips close to a central hub than they are for long-haul routes, said Wilfried Aulbur, who runs Roland Berger's commercial-vehicle-consulting practice. Tesla's Semi is unusual in that it was designed from the ground-up to be electric, rather than being a modified version of a diesel truck, Dr. Aulbur said. The Semi will be capable of accelerating from zero to 60 miles an hour in 20 seconds and recharging up to 70% of its range in half an hour, Tesla says on its website. In keeping with Tesla's propensity for unusual design elements, the Semi's cab features a single, centrally located seat. The steering wheel is flanked by two display screens. \\\"By removing the motor and the transmission in front of the vehicle, we could put the driver in the middle for the best command view,\\\" Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla's chief designer, recently told CNBC . Tesla is aiming to produce 50,000 Semi trucks in 2024 in North America, Mr. Musk said in October. He previously said battery-cell supply constraints made scaling truck production difficult. For now, output remains limited. Tesla might produce 100 semitrailer trucks this year, Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm said during a recent trial over Mr. Musk's compensation package at Tesla. Internal projections from early 2018 contemplated producing thousands of the trucks, she said. Thursday's event comes as Tesla pushes to deliver as many vehicles as possible in the final weeks of the year. The company cut its annual growth expectations this fall, saying it expects to finish the year just shy of its 2022 target of boosting vehicle deliveries by 50%. Tesla is offering a $3,750 credit to U.S. customers who buy certain Model 3s or Model Ys for delivery this month, according to the company's website. Mr. Musk, who runs Twitter and rocket company SpaceX in addition to Tesla, has said he has been spending much of his time recently running the social-media company. At Twitter, Mr. Musk has encountered some challenges engaging with consumer brands. Many have paused advertising on the platform , citing concern over how it would evolve under Mr. Musk. Tesla's brand image, meanwhile, has fallen in long-running surveys. The serial entrepreneur spoke Wednesday at an event for Neuralink Corp. , a neuroscience startup working on brain-implant technologies that he co-founded.

Guo Zhihua/VCG via Getty Images Despite Elon Musk s dramatic stock selloff that briefly put a dent in Tesla s share price in the final weeks of 2021, the company proved to investors that its core business remained solid. On Sunday, the electric carmaker reported record quarterly and full-year earnings that easily beat Wall Street expectations. Tesla delivered 308,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter and 936,000 vehicles in 2021, which almost doubled the total shipment of 2020. Analysts had expected the company to deliver around 270,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter and 897,000 vehicles for the full year. Tesla shares jumped more than 9 percent Monday morning on the news, pushing the company s market cap to $1.17 trillion. The vast majority (90 percent) of Tesla s 2021 deliveries were Model 3 and Model Y. The company reports combined delivery numbers for its higher-priced vehicles (Model S and X) and lower-priced Model 3 and Y vehicles. It doesn t break out sales or production numbers by region. Great work by Tesla team worldwide! Musk tweeted Sunday. This was a trophy case quarter for Musk & Co. with massive momentum moving into 2022, Wedbush s Daniel Ives, a top Tesla analyst, tweeted Sunday. Tesla just announced its 4Q delivery number which beat even the bull case whisper number on the Street. This was a trophy case quarter for Musk & Co. with massive momentum moving into 2022. 309k deliveries vs. the Street's 266k and bull case whisper numbers in the 275k range. Daniel Ives ( ) January 2, 2022 Since turning a profit for the first time in the third quarter of 2019, Tesla has managed to double shipments every year despite a global chip shortage that has slowed down manufacturing for other automakers for the better part of the past two years. Still, Musk has set a lofty goal for Tesla to ramp up production to 20 million electric vehicles a year by 2030. That s 20 times what it made last year. Let s make the roaring 20 s happen! the CEO tweeted Sunday. To achieve that, Tesla plans to start production of the Model Y crossover at a new gigafactory in Austin, Texas this year and open another factory in Brandenburg, Germany near Berlin. For the near term, Wall Street is optimistic that Tesla can double sales again in 2022. Can Tesla do [two million] units in 2022? At this point we d still describe 2mm as a stretch target but one that looks far more realistic following 4Q deliveries, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a note on Monday. We believe that fully ramped, the addition of Berlin and Austin will take the Tesla global installed capacity to closer to 3 million units. Jonas cautioned that continued global supply chain challenges may dampen this outlook. Also, as more startups and legacy auto brands enter the EV market, Tesla is expected to lose some of its market share in the years to come. In the high-end sector, Tesla faces competition from already hyped models such as Lucid Air and Porsche Taycan, as well as luxury EVs by Mercedes and Audi. In the mass market, the Model 3 and Model Y will be challenged by offerings from Volkswagen, GM and Ford, not to mention a crop of well funded Chinese EV startups that are increasingly eating away Tesla s market share in China, its largest overseas market.\n",

            "8-Jan-22 - Tesla's New Austin Factory to Start Up Soon. It's Going to Be Wild. - Christmas arrived a little late for Tesla bulls. They have been eagerly awaiting the start-up of new manufacturing capacity. Now the start-up is imminent. Saturday, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote that Tesla's (ticker: TSLA) new facility in Austin, Texas, known as Gigafactory Texas, will begin production in about a week. That means more Model Y crossover vehicles and, just as important, that the Cybertruck will be arriving on U.S. roads shortly. \"Based on our analysis of Giga Austin it appears paperwork is now clearing the way for Model Y production starting over the next 7 to 10 days,\" wrote Ives. \"Launching the Austin production in early January is very important to Tesla expanding both domestic and global production of Model Y's which are set to have a massive year in 2022.\" Tesla delivered more than 936,000 vehicles in 2021. The vast majority more than 911,000 were Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossover vehicles. Tesla doesn't provide a more detailed breakdown. The Model 3 and Y are Tesla's lower-priced, higher-volume Models. The Model Y is the hottest seller right now and CEO Elon Musk has high hopes for the vehicle. \"We think the Model Y will be the best-selling vehicle of any kind globally,\" said Elon Musk, referring to 2023, at the company's annual meeting held in Austin back in October. \"We need Austin to get online and Berlin to get online and reach volume production, and then I think that's going to happen.\" Wall Street expects Tesla to deliver 1.4 million units in 2022, up 55% compared with 2021. Tesla has given volume guidance, but it is really more like a goal. The company says it wants to grow volume at 50% a year for the foreseeable future. Volumes rose 87% in 2021 compared with 2020. The pace at which production ramps up at Austin will go a long way to determining if Tesla can hit its 50% growth goal this year. Tesla's other new plant, in Berlin, Germany, is also about to start up production. That plant will produce Model Y crossover vehicles to start, like Texas. It should be a wild year for Tesla, which is essentially doubling production capacity, going from two plants to four. Tesla also makes cars in Fremont, Calif., and Shanghai, China. The two new plants means a lot will change. Profit margins will change as European volumes are delivered from Europe instead of from China. In addition to the Model Y, the Austin plant will make the light-duty pickup truck called Cybertruck . That will compete with Ford Motor's (F) all-electric F-150 Lightning in an important vehicle segment in the U.S., where pickup trucks account for 20% of all new vehicle sales. And, of course, investors will watch closely to see if Tesla can sell all its cars as it produces more and as other auto makers, such as Ford with its electric truck, bring more EV models to the market. Tesla stock rose 50% in 2021 as it delivered more cars than expected. It will probably take another delivery \"beat,\" better than 1.4 million, to keep the stock working higher in 2022. Tesla stock opened the year up 13% Monday, Jan. 3, after better-than-expected delivery numbers were released on Jan. 2. Then shares sold off amid a broader tech rout. Investors were spooked by the Federal Reserve's December meeting minutes, which indicated it was committed to raising interest rates. Higher interest rates especially hurt highly valued growth stocks, as the future profits investors are betting on will be worth less. Tesla stock is now down 2.8% year to date. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite are down 1.9%, 0.3%, and 4.5%, respectively. Tesla's New Austin Factory to Start Up Soon. It's Going to Be Wild. Credit: Al Root\n",

            "13-Jan-22 - Elon Musk, Hollywood Actors Criticize California's Plan to Cut Solar Subsidies; State's public utilities commission says proposal balances power grid, environment and consumers' needs; critics say it hampers environmental progress - A proposal to cut incentives for rooftop solar power in California has drawn criticism from some environmentalists, Hollywood stars and business leaders, including Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk. The proposal by the California Public Utilities Commission would add monthly fees for solar customers while also reducing payments to customers for any extra power they generate and supply to the grid, which is known as net metering. Critics say the plan threatens to derail environmental progress in the state. The CPUC, in its proposal, said the current energy-metering structure isn't cost-effective and hurts customers who don't participate in the solar program as well as low-income ratepayers. The rule changes \"ensures all customers pay for their usage of the grid,\" the proposal says. More than one million California customers have solar systems installed, according to the CPUC. Since rooftop solar customers pay less in utility bills, they end up contributing less toward maintaining the grid, which they still use. The cost burden is thus often shifted to power customers without rooftop solar, according to the proposal. Various groups peg that cost shift at between $1 billion and $3.4 billion a year. The proposed change to the net metering rules \"balances the needs of the electric grid, the environment, and consumers,\" a CPUC spokeswoman said Thursday. CPUC said a proposed decision may be heard, at the earliest, at its Jan. 27 voting meeting. If the proposal passes, it would take new residential solar customers about 11 years to make back their upfront investment in solar panels through reduced electricity bills, a jump from the roughly six to seven years it currently takes, according to BloombergNEF estimates. Mr. Musk on Twitter called the proposal a \"bizarre anti-environment move.\" Tesla launched a webpage that calls on Gov. Gavin Newsom and the CPUC to reject \"the proposed solar tax,\" and instructs visitors on how to submit feedback to the relevant public bodies and officials. Mr. Musk's Tesla has a financial incentive to oppose the CPUC proposal. Tesla invests in solar energy with its green energy subsidiary, Tesla Energy. It sells solar panels and battery systems that store solar energy. Tesla purchased solar-energy company SolarCity Corp. in 2016. Tesla representatives didn't respond Thursday to a request for comment. Some environmental groups and Hollywood celebrities have voiced concerns, saying the rooftop solar market is key to the state meeting its climate goals. Actor Edward Norton said the proposal comes while California is \"burning & drying out due to climate change.\" The CPUC proposal says the net-energy metering program \"has and should continue to assist the State in meeting its energy and climate goals.\" \"However, because the Commission is mandated to create a tariff that adheres to the entire statute including equity concerns the growth of the market should not come at the undue and burdensome financial expense of nonparticipant Ratepayers,\" it said. Mr. Newsom said at a press conference earlier this week that \"we still have some work to do,\" regarding the proposal. A spokesman for the Democratic governor said that the CPUC is an independent commission, which will ultimately decide on the matter. \"In the meantime, Governor Newsom continues to move forward with his commitment to California's clean energy goals, which includes the ability for Californians to access a diverse range of renewable energy sources,\" the spokesman said.

            "14-Jan-22 - Elon Musk-Backed EV Battery Technology Rises to Dominance in China; Tesla, Chinese makers take lead over rivals in using less-expensive iron in place of nickel - A less-expensive battery technology championed by Tesla Inc.'s Elon Musk rose to dominate the world's largest auto market last year, pointing to challenges for Tesla's U.S. and European rivals. Official Chinese figures showed that batteries using lithium iron phosphate or LFP technology accounted for 57% of total battery production for vehicles in China during 2021, up from less than half the previous year. The LFP batteries have stormed into the lead in China because they use relatively inexpensive iron in the battery's cathode in place of costlier metals such as nickel. Their rise has coincided with the emergence of electric vehicles as a mass-market product in China. In 2021, new-energy vehicles, a category that mostly consists of EVs, accounted for nearly one in six passenger cars sold in China , the world's top auto market by number of vehicles sold. As Chinese car dealers sell more EVs and a greater proportion of those EVs carry LFP batteries, production of the iron batteries is surging. In 2021, Chinese battery makers produced LFP batteries with 125.4 gigawatt-hours of capacity, more than triple the figure from a year earlier, said the government-backed China Automotive Battery Research Institute. U.S. and European car companies traditionally frowned on LFP batteries because they tend to have lower energy density than nickel-based batteries, meaning the cars they power can't travel as far on a single charge. LFP batteries also are more likely to suffer from poor performance in cold weather. Over the last two decades, Chinese companies trying to catch up with Japan and the U.S. in battery technology focused on improving LFP technology, not only because of the cost but also because the batteries are less likely to catch fire. A change in Chinese government EV subsidies, which previously favored longer-range cars, also helped the technology gain an edge. One of the strongest advocates is Tesla's Mr. Musk, who has said that finding enough nickel at reasonable cost is a major production concern. He has pushed back against the idea that customers buying an LFP car are getting a second-class product. \"Our intent with this pack is that product experience is roughly equivalent between nickel & iron,\" Mr. Musk wrote on Twitter last August to a customer who was offered earlier delivery of a Tesla if he chose the LFP option. \"I'd personally slightly opt for iron pack, as it wants to be charged to 100% whereas nickel prefers ~90%,\" Mr. Musk said in the Twitter post. Car makers in the U.S., Europe and Japan are all stepping up battery production and many are working on LFP technology, but they generally haven't gotten as far as Tesla and Chinese makers in bringing the technology into mass-market production. Tesla first used LFP batteries for its China-made Model 3 in 2020. Last October, the company said it would extend the use of the iron-based batteries to all of its standard-range cars. China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., the world's biggest maker of electric-vehicle batteries, supplies Tesla with LFP batteries. Other Chinese electric vehicle brands are also becoming heavy users of LFP cathodes. The Hong Guang Mini, a tiny hatchback costing as little as $4,400, was China's bestselling EV in 2021. It is made by a joint venture of General Motors Co. and two other Chinese companies. Warren Buffett-backed BYD Co. Ltd., a Chinese company that makes both electric vehicles and the batteries that go into them, has designed an LFP battery in a blade shape. It says its design has higher energy density to give EVs longer range. \"Almost all the car brands you can think of are in talks with us about cooperation based on blade battery technologies,\" BYD's Vice President He Long said last year when announcing the battery, according to the company's social-media account.

            "17-Jan-22 - Smart progressives should love Elon Musk - Nearly everything Sen. Elizabeth Warren tweeted about Elon Musk was wrong. Scratch the word nearly. Everything was wrong. Last month, the senator from Massachusetts tweeted, Let s change the rigged tax code so the Person of the Year will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everyone else. Some background: The founder of Tesla had just been anointed the richest human on earth, and Time Magazine named him Person of the Year. Three months before, SpaceX, which he also founded, sent the first all-civilian crew into space. Musk tweeted back to Warren, And if you opened your eyes for 2 seconds, you would realize I will pay more taxes than any American in history this year. He s put the number at something north of $11 billion, which, if true, would be more taxes than any other American paid ever. Whether Musk s tax bill should have been higher can be subject for debate. We can agree that $11 billion is a healthy tax bill, but it s not an unseemly sum for one enjoying a net worth of around $243 billion. Warren s implication that Musk doesn t pay taxes at all, however, is ignorant. The charge that he s freeloading if you look at how he made that money is awe-inspiring dumb. Musk has done more than any person on earth to replace cars run by the internal combustion engine, a significant factor in the climate crisis, with clean electric vehicles. In 2020, when General Motors and Ford were closing factories because they couldn t find enough specialized computer chips, Tesla took the chips that were around and rewrote software to make them work in its cars. So while Ford, GM and Stellantis (Fiat Chrysler merged with Peugeot) sold fewer cars in 2021 than the year before, Tesla sold 87% more. Six years ago, when the major U.S. carmakers were wondering whether or not to go big on electric, Tesla was building a huge battery factory in Nevada. The others are now in the game major league, and Tesla can be credited with pushing them. But in the marathon race to win the electric vehicle market, Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said, Tesla is in the lead at mile number 21. Everybody else is at mile 2 or still tying their shoes. So Musk is full of himself. He has reasons. What bothers some 20th-century progressives is that Musk is an unapologetic capitalist who mocks them for obsessing on his wealth. Leading the pack is Sen. Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator s brain has long been stalled on the subject of billionaires whom he once said shouldn t exist. When he tweeted, We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share. Period, Musk trolled him: I keep forgetting that you re still alive. Musk may not be volunteering to pay more taxes than he has to, but we who think the superrich should pay more must understand that the solution is not them, but the tax laws. The tax code is the creation of Congress. Back to Warren. As we face the existential threat of our time climate change, she wrote as a presidential candidate, Wall Street is refusing to listen, let alone take real action. Wrong again. Actually, Wall Street has been moving away from investments in fossil fuels to the point that Texas passed a law banning companies that refuse to finance oil ventures from state contracts. It is Wall Street that rewarded Musk for accelerating the changeover to electric vehicles. (Tesla also has a thriving solar panel business.) If helping save the planet let Musk edge out Amazon s Jeff Bezos as the world s richest person, well, where s the problem? (Harrop is a writer for Creators Syndicate)\n",

The report stated that Musk had purchased a personal stake of 9.2% of the company, which resulted in him making over $1 billion profit. This news caused the stock price to increase by over 20% within 24 hours, reaching an all-time high of $266 per share. This surge is likely due to investors' confidence in Musk's ability to turn Twitter around and his track record of success with Tesla.

This would help in deciding how your company can stay competitive without compromising profitability. You could consider offering an additional service, like a personal safety guarantee for example, that is not being offered by your competitor and therefore differentiates your product from theirs.

Elon Musk and Cathie Wood have both warned about the negative effects of higher interest rates on tech stocks, but their views are just one piece of the larger puzzle.\n",
            "One of the main concerns with higher rates is that it makes borrowing more expensive for businesses, which can slow down growth and investment in new technologies. This has been particularly challenging for companies in the tech sector, which often rely on debt financing to fund research and development or acquisitions. Additionally, higher interest rates can lead to a decrease in consumer spending, as people are less likely to make large purchases when borrowing is more expensive.\n",
            "However, it's important to note that not all tech stocks have been negatively impacted by the Fed's rate hikes. Some companies, particularly those with strong earnings and solid balance sheets, may be able to weather the storm and even benefit from higher rates by issuing debt at a lower cost. Additionally, some investors believe that higher interest rates could actually provide an opportunity for value investing in tech stocks, as they become cheaper relative to other sectors.\n",

            "2. The company that is dealing with Decreased Consumer Spending is from the Food Industry.\n",

            "\n",
            "Question: Can you match each company to its respective industry and the issue it's currently facing?\n",

            "Let's use a method called proof by exhaustion, which means we'll start with all possible scenarios for one company then eliminate those that contradict our given conditions until only one scenario remains.\n",
            "\n",
            "From condition 1, A is not in Tech or Fashion and is not experiencing Slowed Growth. So the industries it can be are Food or Banking. But from step 4, D is in Tech and doesn't experience slowed growth, so A must be in Banking. \n",
            "\n",
            "Now let's consider Condition 3. Since we know that A is in Banking industry, Company B isn't dealing with Cost of Debt and isn't in the Tech Industry either. Therefore, the only industries left for B are Food or Fashion. But the company facing Decreased Consumer Spending (Condition 2) is from the Food Industry and since the only issue left to be dealt with by A (Banking) is Slowed Growth, this means that Company B must be dealing with Cost of Debt.\n",
            "\n",
            "Since we've identified the Banking industry's company as A and its issue as Slowed Growth, and we know Company D is in Tech industry but doesn't face Slowed Growth, this leaves only Decreased Investment in New Technologies for Company D to deal with. \n",
            "\n",
            "Now the only issues left are Cost of Debt, Slowed Growth, and Decreased Consumer Spending, which means that B cannot be dealing with Cost of Debt (Condition 8) or Slowed Growth (Condition 6), so it must be facing Decreased Consumer Spending. This leaves Cost of Debt as the issue for Company C.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, since all other issues have been assigned, and from Condition 5, the Fashion industry company is experiencing Decreased Investment in New Technologies, this means that Company D has to be in Food industry (since Tech isn't). \n",

            "Elon Musk' statements about these rate hikes have also negatively impacted Tesla's image.

According to their statements, higher rates are dragging down technology stocks, which could lead to lower valuations for some companies.

According to Barron'S' \"Tech Earnings Are a Reflection of the Postpandemic Economy. Facebook's Parent Is Next.\" article published on 27-Apr-22, the Fed's decision to raise interest rates has led to increased inflation and a higher cost of borrowing for businesses in the tech sector. This can impact their ability to invest in research and development, as well as expand operations. Elon Musk has also expressed concerns about inflation and its potential impact on Tesla's business.\n",

However, it's important to note that the specific impact of these rate hikes will depend on many factors, such as market conditions and how businesses respond to them.\n",
